Description of Business
Visteon Corporation (the "Company" or "Visteon") a global automotive technology company serving the mobility industry, dedicated to creating more enjoyable, connected, and safe driving experiences. Our platforms leverage proven, scalable hardware and software solutions that enable the digital, electric, and autonomous evolution of our global automotive customers, including Ford, BMW, Mazda, Volkswagen, Renault, Nissan, Daimler, General Motors, Stellantis, and Jaguar/Land Rover. Visteon products align with key industry trends and include digital instrument clusters, displays, Android-based infotainment systems, domain controllers, advanced driver assistance systems ("ADAS"), and battery management systems. Visteon is headquartered in Van Buren Township, Michigan, and has an international network of manufacturing operations, technical centers, and joint venture operations dedicated to the design, development, manufacture, and support of its product offerings and its global customers. The Company's manufacturing and engineering footprint is principally located in China, India, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, and Mexico.
The Company’s Industry 
The Company operates in the automotive industry, which is cyclical and highly sensitive to general economic conditions. The Company believes that future success in the automotive industry is, in part, dependent on alignment with customers to support their efforts to effectively meet the challenges associated with the following significant trends and developments in the global automotive industry:
•Electronic content and connectivity - The electronic content of vehicles continues to increase due to various regulatory requirements and consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality. The use of electronic components can reduce weight, expedite assembly, enhance fuel economy, improve emissions, increase safety, and enhance vehicle performance. These benefits coincide with vehicles becoming more electric, connected, and automated. Additionally, digital and portable technologies have dramatically influenced the lifestyle of today’s consumers, who expect products that enable such a lifestyle. Consequently, the vehicle cockpit is transforming into a fully digital environment with multi-display systems incorporating larger, curved, and complex displays and the consolidation of discrete electronic control units into a multi-core domain controller. 
•Electric vehicles – The trend towards electrification continues to accelerate, driven by government incentives and standards, announced restrictions of internal combustion engine vehicles in multiple cities and countries, and the significant increase of investment in electrification by Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"). The shift to electric vehicles increases the digital content of a vehicle as the majority of cockpit electronics will be all-digital to support the new electrical architecture. In addition, all battery electric vehicles will require a battery management system to manage the rechargeable battery pack. 
•Advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving - The industry continues to advance toward semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. The Society of Automotive Engineers has defined five levels of autonomy ranging from levels one and two with driver-assist functions whereby the driver is responsible for monitoring the environment, to level five with full autonomy under all conditions. Levels one and two are already popular in the market while levels three and above utilize a combination of sensors, radars, cameras and LiDARs, requiring sensor fusion and machine learning technologies, as the system assumes the role of monitoring the environment. Level three includes features such as highway pilot and parking assist technology, for which an increased market penetration rate is expected over the next several years.
•Safety and security - Governments continue to focus regulatory efforts on safer transportation. Accordingly, OEMs are working to improve occupant and pedestrian safety by incorporating more safety-oriented technology in their vehicles. Additionally, in-vehicle connectivity has increased the need for robust cybersecurity systems to protect data, applications, and associated infrastructure. Security features are evolving with advances in sensors and suppliers must enable the security/safety initiatives of their customers including the development of such new advances.
•Vehicle standardization - OEMs continue to standardize vehicle platforms on a global basis, resulting in a lower number of individual vehicle platforms, design cost savings, and further scale of economies through the production of a greater number of models from each platform. Having operations in the geographic markets in which OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs’ needs more economically and efficiently, thus making global coverage a source of significant competitive advantage for suppliers with a diversified global footprint. Additionally, OEMs are looking to 
suppliers for increased collaboration to lower costs, reduce risks, and decrease overall time to market. Suppliers that can provide fully engineered systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing. As vehicles become more connected and cockpits more digitized, suppliers that can deliver modular hardware architectures, “open” software architectures, and a software platform approach will be poised to help OEMs achieve greater reuse of validated hardware circuitry, design scalability, and faster development cycles.

The Company’s Customers
The Company's ultimate customers are global vehicle manufacturers including BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Jaguar/Land Rover, Mazda, Nissan, Renault, Stellantis, and Volkswagen. 
The following is a summary of customers with a percentage of net sales greater than 10 percent:

 | Percentage of Total Net Sales | 
 | December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Ford | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 22 | %
BMW | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 8 | %

The Company typically supplies products to OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum quantities. Individual purchase orders can be cancelled for cause, non-performance, and, in most cases, insolvency or certain change in control events. Additionally, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate contracts for convenience; this option permits the OEM customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program or issue purchase orders for less than the duration of the vehicle program. This has the potential to reduce the Company’s profit margin and increases the risk of loss of future sales under those purchase contracts. 
The Company manufactures and ships based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary based on OEM automotive production or dealer inventory levels. Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that the Company will supply certain levels of OEM production in those future periods, customer agreements (including the applicable terms and conditions) do not necessarily constitute firm orders.
The price related to these products are typically negotiated on an annual basis. Any subsequent price reductions are intended to take into account expected annual cost reductions to the Company of providing products and services to the customer, through such factors as manufacturing productivity enhancements, material cost reductions and design-related cost improvements. Certain products may be excluded from such reductions or experience price increases due to shortages of material or other increases in supply chain or other related costs. The Company has an aggressive cost control program that focuses on reducing its total costs intended to offset customer price reductions or negotiating recoveries for increases. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s cost reduction or recovery efforts will be sufficient to fully offset such price changes. These relationships may extend over the life of the related vehicle.
The terms and conditions generally require a warranty on products sold; in most cases, the warranty period is the same as the warranty offered by the OEM to the ultimate customer. The Company may also be required to share in all or part of recall costs if the OEM recalls vehicles for defects attributable to Visteon products.
The Company’s Competition 
The automotive sector continues to remain highly competitive resulting from the ongoing industry consolidation. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of financial viability, product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise, development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design, manufacturing capability, flexibility, customer service, and overall management. The Company's primary independent competitors include, but are not limited to, Alpine Electronics, Aptiv PLC, Continental AG, Denso Corporation, Faurecia, Harman International Industries, Incorporated (a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.), Hitachi Ltd., Hyundai Mobis, Innolux Corporation, Marelli Holdings Co., Ltd., Nippon Seiki, Panasonic Corporation, Preh GmbH, Robert Bosch GmbH, and Vitesco Technologies.
The Company’s Business Seasonality and Cyclicality
Historically, the Company’s business has been moderately seasonal because its largest North American customers typically cease production for approximately two weeks in July for model year changeovers and approximately one week in December during the winter holidays. Customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August and one week in December. In China, customers typically shut down approximately one week in early October and one week in January or February. Additionally, third-quarter automotive production is traditionally lower as new vehicle models enter production. However, in 2021 the standard cyclicality of the business was altered due to supply chain challenges creating roll shutdowns amongst multiple customer production facilities throughout the year.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Attract and Retain
The Company’s ability to sustain and grow its business requires the recruitment, retention and development of a highly skilled and diverse workforce. The Company’s Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO"), reporting directly to Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), oversees its global talent processes to attract, develop and retain its employees. To attract the best talent, the Company offers market competitive compensation and benefits around the globe, annual and long-term incentive programs, as well as health and wellness benefits. The Company also provides a variety of resources to help its employees grow in their current roles and build new skills. Hundreds of online courses are available in the Company’s learning management system where individual development is emphasized as part of the annual goal setting process. The Company continues to build tools to be used leaders to develop employees in their current role and create new opportunities within the organization to learn and grow. Because retention of the employee base is significant to its business strategy, executive management discusses it with the Board of Directors on a regular basis.
Workforce
Visteon’s strength comes from a workforce of approximately 10,000 employees operating in approximately 18 countries globally. Our workforce is globally distributed with 26% of employees located in the Americas, 32% in Europe, 19% in China, 
and 23% in the Asia Pacific region. Visteon believes that all employees are leaders and expects leaders to drive operational and financial results and build strong teams. 
Many of the Company’s employees are members of industrial trade unions and confederations within their respective countries. Often these organizations operate under collectively bargained contracts that are not specific to any one employer. The Company constantly works to establish and maintain positive, cooperative relations with its unions and work representatives around the world.
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity represents an environment where the contributions of all employees are encouraged and valued. As a global organization, the Company embraces human differences and harnesses the power of its employees’ varied backgrounds, cultures and experiences because it is the right thing to do for our people and it creates a competitive business advantage. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of our global workforce represented by females was approximately 40%. The Company encourages many forms of communication such as global town hall employee meetings, informal small-group employee discussions, and an open-door policy so all employees have direct access to senior leadership and have the opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide input. As stated in one of our four core beliefs and values, “We treat each other with respect and embrace our differences.” 
Workplace Safety
The Company requires protective equipment, enforces comprehensive safety policies and procedures, and encourages its employees and leaders to continually look for ways to improve workplace safety. It has implemented and maintains a health and safety management system that is certified to the OHSAS 18001 or ISO 45001 standard. The Company provides regular health and safety reports to the Board of Directors including updates on the return to work health and safety protocols globally as a result of COVID-19. To protect its employees and maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented a number of new health-related measures including a requirement to wear face-masks at all times while on its property, increased hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures, social-distancing, restrictions on visitors to its facilities, and limiting in-person meetings.
Regulation
Visteon operates in a constantly evolving global regulatory environment and is subject to numerous and varying regulatory requirements for its product performance and material content. Visteon’s strives to identify potential regulatory and quality risks early in the design and development process and proactively manage them throughout the product lifecycle through the use of routine assessments, protocols, standards, performance measures, and audits. New regulations and changes to existing regulations are managed in collaboration with the OEM customers and implemented through Visteon’s global systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations.
Visteon works collaboratively with a number of stakeholder groups including government agencies, customers, and suppliers to proactively engage in federal, state, and international public policy processes.
Environmental, Health, Safety, and Legal Matters
Visteon is involved in various lawsuits, claims and proceedings related to the operation of its businesses, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment, commercial and contractual matters, tax, and various other matters. Although the outcome of such lawsuits, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to Visteon, it is management's opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on Visteon's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented. Further details are provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note 19, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
Board Oversight of Environmental, Social, and Governance Practices
The Company and its Board of Directors believe positive environmental, social and governance-related business practices strengthens the Company, increases its connection with the stockholders and helps it to better serve its customers and the communities in which it operates. The Company’s commitment to social responsibility extends to the environment, anti-corruption and trade compliance, responsible sourcing, human rights, labor practices, and worker health and safety. In light of the continued importance of these matters, the Board of Directors and Management have developed a multi-year road map to 
enhance the Company’s environmental, social and governance-related programs and disclosures, including assessment of the potential risks associated with climate change. This road map includes environmental targets for 2025 aimed at reducing energy consumption, solid waste, water and the reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 CO2 emissions through the use of renewable energy. Management provides regular reports and presentations to the Corporate Sustainability and Governance Committee and the full Board of Directors has oversight of the Company’s environmental and social initiatives.
The Company’s Product Research and Development
The Company’s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications. 
The Company’s Intellectual Property 
The Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, copyrights, proprietary tools and technologies, trade secrets, and numerous licensing arrangements. Although the Company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position, no single patent, copyright, proprietary tool or technology, trade secret or license, or group of related patents, copyrights, proprietary tools or technologies, trade secrets or licenses is, in the opinion of management, of such value to the Company that its business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. The Company’s general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis, in appropriate countries, on its patentable developments that are considered to have commercial significance. The Company also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a whole. In addition, the Company holds rights in a number of other trade names and marks applicable to certain of its businesses and products that it views as important to such businesses and products.
The Company’s International Operations
Financial information about sales and net property by major geographic region can be found in Note 20, "Segment Information and Revenue Recognition," to the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
The Company’s Raw Materials and Suppliers
Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products include electronics components, resins, and precious metals. While generally the supply of the materials used are available from numerous sources, semiconductor suppliers and silicon wafer production is concentrated. In general, the Company does not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. The Company monitors its supply base and endeavors to work with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact of potential material shortages and supply disruptions. 
The Company, along with automotive companies around the world, has experienced a shortage in semiconductors as a result of suppliers inability to rapidly reallocate production to serve the automotive industry during a time of increased demand. The Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of our customers due to events which are outside the Company's control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, and other extraordinary events. The Company is working closely with suppliers and customers to attempt to minimize potential adverse impacts of these events. 
The automotive supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials, labor and associated freight costs, which can place operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses, and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost-reductions, and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures.
