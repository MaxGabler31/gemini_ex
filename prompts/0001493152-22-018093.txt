Overview
 
BlueOne Card Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), through our relationship with our program manager, EndlessOne Global, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Program Manager”), is a reseller of an all-in-one prepaid, branded card to be issued by the Program Manager which we believe has numerous user benefits. Through our relationship with our Program Manager, we are aiming to provide innovative pay out solutions and prepaid cards to consumers. Unlike other prepaid card distributors and companies, we specifically aim to target those customers who are unbanked, or non-bankable, and who have needs crossing international borders. The Program Manager’s platform has been recently completed and is functional, however, nominal revenues have been derived therefrom.
 
According to the 2018 data from the Federal Reserve, there are an estimated 55 million adults currently residing in the U.S. who are unbanked or underbanked.1 This means that about 17% of the entire U.S. population has difficulties utilizing the standard banking system. This is our target group customers. Through our relationship with the Program Manager, we will earn our revenues mostly through commissions derived from monthly fees charged to customers to the Program Manager provided by us for the issued general purpose reloadable prepaid card, reloading fees, ATM withdrawal fees, and card to card money transaction fees. We will be acting as an independent sales representative of the Program Manager and we will not receive revenue from customer contracts, which will be executed with the Program Manager.
 
To date, we have generated nominal revenues from our planned business and our business is in a development stage. The Program Manager’s platform is functional and only nominal revenues have been derived therefrom.
 
We are currently headquartered in Newport Beach, California.

The Program Manager’s Unique Platform
 
We believe the Program Manager provides a unique platform different from other competitors. Unlike many other institutions and companies who only do card-to-card transfer domestically, the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards instantly transfers money from card-to-card across the border through a mobile application. Consumers who receive the card-to-card transfer will easily be able to cash out the money at any Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) in the world. Thus, using the Program Manager’s platform, consumers save time, as well as enjoy reasonable foreign exchange rate cost.

Principal Products and Services
 
The Program Manager offers prepaid, branded cards that provide consumer benefits such as no overdraft fees, no interest fees, virtual bank accounts, and free direct deposit. We act as a reseller of the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards pursuant to the Reseller Agreement.
 
Some of the benefits of the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards are as follows:
 

● | The mobile application is functional now for iOS devices (Apple), android, and windows (Microsoft). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Program Manager provides a Global Remittance Network (“GRN”) meaning that it will connect any proprietary accounts or card systems to other systems worldwide. 
● | Free checking account and check books. 
● | We intend to resell the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards to liquor stores throughout the U.S. and online at www.blueonecard.com as well. 
● | The Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards provides a Dynamic Card Verification Value (“CVV”) function. 
● | The Program Manger’s prepaid, branded cards access are lock and unlocked with Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope (“SAFE”) technology. Consumers will also instantly be able to lock and unlock the cards via text Short Message Service (“SMS”). 
● | The Program Manager provides a free checking account. 
● | We believe checks will be able to be directly deposited via the Program Manager’s mobile application. 

Market Strategy
 
Currently, without the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards, numerous of those users who are unbanked or underbanked, use methods such as Western Union, or its mobile application, in order to send and receive funds to and from others, especially if it is an international money transfer and non-domestic. This makes the user’s experience more complicated as cashing in checks and paying bills become a lot more costly and also very time consuming. Also, other ordinary prepaid debit cards may charge very high fees.
 
In comparison, we believe the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards re safer than cash, more convenient than checks, and very easy to obtain through liquor stores or online, which are the principal methods we intend to resell the cards. Not only this, there are also no troubles with exchange rates, and transfers being cancelled or rejected after days unlike using other financial service companies. With the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards, high cash checking fees are eliminated, and direct deposit can be made to save the consumer’s time and money. Also, with its global remittance network provided by the Program Manager, the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards connect proprietary accounts or card systems to other systems in any parts of the world.
 
Distribution of Products and Services
 
Looking solely at other prepaid card competitors located in big grocery stores such as Walmart, Target, etc., we aim to differentiate ourselves from them by targeting liquor stores across the U.S. for distribution of the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards. The reason for this is that we believe that many of the unbanked with lower income users access liquor stores more frequently than the larger stores. Not only this, we anticipate that setting up a money loading system in liquor stores will save time in the lives of most consumers.
 
According to industry data, we believe there are approximately 34,000 liquor stores currently in the U.S. and we initially intend to target up to 7,000 of those stores for distribution of the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards. We resell the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards through our website. If we are able to distribute the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards to these stores throughout the U.S. under the terms of the Reseller Agreement, we estimate our revenues would be extensive. We believe that the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded card will be very affordable compared to the traditional alternatives. The reasons for this are as follows:

● | Lock and Unlock – SAFE Technology allows cardholders to instantly lock and unlock their cards via SMS or Cardholder online Portal. Cardholders can personalize the lock feature for ATM, POS, withdrawals, transfers, recurring payments, auto-lock and more.

● | Dynamic CVV Technology – Dynamic CVV Technology SAFE Technology empowers cardholders to easily change their CVV code for one-time use. Through mobile authorization, SAFE Technology offers the most secure armored layer of security available for cardholders. 

Global Remittance Network (“GRN”)
 

● | GRN is a worldwide remittance messaging system, an “any-to-any” switch that connects any proprietary account or card system to other systems in the world. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | This remittance network can link card to card, regardless of Network, account to account, including a credit or debit card to account. 
● | Initial customer acquisition is based on leveraging and empowering existing card portfolios and global business relationships in both sending and receiving countries. 
● | GRN operates within a closed loop of banks, accounts, card, or wallet programs. 
● | Participants in the GRM Network will share in the margins generated out of the transaction fees. 

 
We believe that we will be able to enter into distribution agreements with liquor store owners to distribute the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded card in their respective stores due to the fact that we believe it will greatly increase traffic to the respective stores due to demand for the card. With heavier traffic, we believe there will be increased sales in each liquor store as numerous people will walk in to load money and purchase GPR prepaid cards. We believe this will also benefit the store owner as there will be increased premium later on for the store itself. Thus, there will be an exchange of benefit between the multitude of liquor stores throughout the U.S. that we intend to target and our Company.
 
Marketing of Products and Services
 
We market the Program Manager’s products and services through an extensive network of sales representatives and through our website, www.blueonecard.com.

Competition
 
Our core business includes the offering of the Program Manager’s prepaid, branded cards that provide consumer benefits such as no overdraft fees, no interest fees, virtual bank accounts, and free direct deposit. Consequently, we, as a reseller of the cards, compete against companies and financial institutions across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries and we may also compete with others in the market who may in the future provide offerings similar to ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors are entities substantially larger in size (such as Green Dot Corporation), more highly diversified in revenue, and substantially more established with significantly more broadly known brand awareness than ours. As such, many of our competitors can leverage their size, robust networks, financial wherewithal, brand awareness, pricing power and technological assets to compete with us. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors are subject to fewer regulations and restrictions than we are and thus may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes.
Government Regulations
 
Although the Program Manager is subject to extensive government regulation, as a reseller, we are not subject to the same regulations. If the Program Manager fails to comply with government regulations applicable to it, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
U.S. Securities Laws
 
We are subject to regulations by U.S. federal and state securities laws as a public company, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
