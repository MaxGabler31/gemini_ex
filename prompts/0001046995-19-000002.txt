     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Introduction
     We design, develop, manufacture and market organic light emitting diode, or OLED miniature displays, which we refer to as OLED-on-silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilize OLED microdisplays, and related products. We also perform research in the OLED field. Our virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce high-resolution microdisplays which, when viewed through a magnifying headset, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large‑screen television. Our products enable our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers in the military, and commercial markets to develop and market improved or new electronic products.  
 ﻿
 We believe that our OLED microdisplays offer a number of significant advantages over comparable liquid crystal microdisplays, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and negligible image smearing. Using our active matrix OLED technology, many computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplay silicon backplane, resulting in compact, high resolution and power efficient systems. Already proven in military and commercial systems, our product portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high‑resolution, virtual images that perform effectively even in extreme temperatures and high‑vibration conditions. 
 ﻿
 Our OEM customers incorporate our OLED displays in a variety of products including, military aviation helmets,  military weapons sights and targeting systems, night vision and thermal imaging devices, training and simulation, visualization for ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound and augmented reality applications.
 ﻿
 We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in OLED and OLED-on-silicon microdisplay technology. We have an intellectual property portfolio that includes 32 U.S. patents and 24 pending U.S. patent applications (two of which have received a Notice of Allowance), and have over 20 years of manufacturing know-how and other proprietary technologies to create our high performance OLED microdisplays. We believe that we are one of only a few companies to market and produce significant quantities of high resolution, small molecule OLED-on-silicon microdisplays. 
 ﻿
 We also believe that our dPd technology which we introduced during 2018, gives us an advantage over other OLED microdisplays because it allows us to produce microdisplays with the high brightness required for VR and AR and certain military applications. Traditional OLED microdisplays utilize white emitting OLED with color filters that lessen the intensity of emitted light by as much as 85%, significantly reducing brightness. Microdisplays manufactured by direct patterning do not require color filters to achieve color variations and allow for the application of more efficient OLED structures which achieve higher brightness. Direct patterning also allows for much lower power and longer life when run at the same luminance of a color filter display
 ﻿
 We derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our OLED microdisplay products to the military, commercial and consumer markets. We also earn revenue from government research and development contracts. In addition, we generate limited sales from optics and microdisplays combined with optics. 
 ﻿
 We were formed in March 2000, through the merger of Fashion Dynamics Corporation, and FED Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of optical systems and microdisplays for use in the electronics industry. Simultaneous with this merger, we changed our name to eMagin Corporation. We are incorporated in the state of Delaware. 
 ﻿
 Our common stock is traded on the NYSE: American under the symbol EMAN.
 ﻿
 Our Industry
 A microdisplay generally has a screen size that is less than two inches in diagonal. The miniature size enables microdisplays to be used in a wide variety of applications that require a screen that takes up small space, such as head‑mounted displays or HMDs, weapon sights and viewfinders of digital cameras. Microdisplays are used across various industries, including the military, commercial and consumer markets in which we operate. Microdisplays provide many advantages over other displays where small size is a requirement. Benefits include compact size, high brightness and resolution, low power consumption, and high contrast.     Our Technology Platform
 Our microdisplays are based upon active matrix small molecule OLED technology, which we refer to as active matrix OLED or AMOLED. Our AMOLED technology permits millions of individual low‑voltage light sources to be built on low‑cost, silicon computer chips to produce single color, white or full‑color display arrays. Using our OLED technology, many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the silicon chip, under the OLED film, resulting in a compact, integrated system with lower overall system costs relative to alternative technologies.
 OLEDs are thin films of stable organic materials that emit light of various colors when a voltage is applied to them. OLEDs are emissive devices, which mean that they create their own light, as opposed to liquid crystal displays, which require a separate light source. As a result, our OLED microdisplays use less power and deliver much higher contrast and fuller color than liquid crystal microdisplays. Unlike liquid crystal displays which use crossed polarizers to generate black level, OLED displays exhibit an extremely high contrast ratio which results in very vivid images. Because the light they emit is lambertian, which means that it appears equally bright from most forward directions, a moderate movement in the eye does not change the image brightness or color as it does in other technologies.
 Our technology is based on integrating a proprietary OLED device with a specially designed silicon backplane to produce efficient and high performance AMOLED microdisplays. Our OLED displays incorporate a proprietary, top‑emitting structure for our OLED devices that enables OLED displays to be built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than only on glass. Our OLED microdisplays emit full visible spectrum (white) light that is isolated with color filters to create color images. Our microdisplays have a brightness that can be greater than that of a typical notebook computer and can have a potential useful life of over 50,000 operating hours in certain applications. New processes and device improvements, such as our OLED‑XLS technology, offer even better brightness, efficiency, and lifespan. 
 We have developed extremely bright OLED microdisplays using our patented dPd technology and have demonstrated color high resolution 2K x 2K and widescreen ultra extended graphics array, or WUXGA, microdisplays with brightness in excess of 7,500 nits, which we believe is the world’s highest resolution and brightness. In addition to our AMOLED technology, we have developed compact optic and lens enhancements, which when coupled with the microdisplay, help our OEM customers provide a high quality large screen appearance.
 We believe that our AMOLED technology provides significant advantages over other microdisplay technologies in our targeted markets. These key advantages include:

· | High brightness;
--+-----------------


· | Sharp contrast;
--+----------------


· | Low power consumption for improved battery life and longer system life;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High‑speed performance resulting in clear video images;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | Compact form factor and light weight;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Wide angle light emission resulting in large apparent screen size and more immersive experience;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Wide operating temperature range;
--+----------------------------------


· | Good environmental stability (vibration and humidity); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Anticipated low manufacturing cost at higher volumes.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  Our Market Opportunities
 We target the military, commercial (in which we include the medical and industrial sectors), and consumer markets with many of our products catering to multiple markets. Within each of these market sectors we believe that our OLED microdisplays, when combined with compact optic lenses, can become a key component for a variety of mobile electronic products.  Military 
 We believe that head‑mounted systems incorporating our microdisplays increase the user’s effectiveness by allowing hands‑free operation and increased situational awareness with sufficient brightness for use in daylight, yet controllable for nighttime light security. As a COTS (commercial off‑the‑shelf) component, OLED microdisplays possess performance characteristics important to demanding military and commercial (e.g., industrial) applications, including high contrast, wide dimming range, shock and vibration resistance and insensitivity to high G‑forces. The design features and performance characteristics of our OLED microdisplays reduce the size, weight, and power required by current and future military systems, while also providing a wide operating temperature range. The image does not flicker or have color breakup in vibrating environments and the microdisplay’s wide viewing angle allows ease of viewing for long periods.  Most important, our OLED’s low power consumption reduces battery weight and, for military applications, reduces constraints on mission length due to battery life. The OLED’s wide operating temperature range is of special interest for military applications because the display can turn on instantly at temperatures far below freezing and can operate at high temperatures such as in desert conditions. We believe that our microdisplay products provide power advantages over other microdisplay technologies, particularly liquid crystal displays which require backlights and heaters and cannot provide instant‑on capabilities at low temperatures. Incorporating OLED microdisplays into aviation helmets has been made possible in part by the high brightness, high contrast and other performance features of the OLED technology that we have developed.
 Our products’ military applications primarily fall into three broad areas: (1) helmet‑mounted and handheld displays for situational awareness and data; (2) night vision/thermal imaging goggles, weapons sights, and handheld viewers; and (3) training and simulation devices. These systems are also well suited for demanding operations including; homeland defense, fire and rescue and urban security.
 Situational Awareness.  Our OLED microdisplays have been incorporated into a broad range of U.S. and foreign military situational awareness programs. Situational awareness products include head‑mounted displays that are used to display images, including digital map, sensor imagery and pilot aviation information. In addition, handheld imagers provide improved situational awareness on the battlefield, as well as in training and simulation. These products can also be combined with a weapon system to give the user the capability to select targets without direct exposure.  During 2018, we delivered initial displays under a program with Collins Aerospace to support the F-35 Lightning II helmet.  These custom designed displays are a key component in providing superior contrast with no “green glow” inherent in the previous display.  We expect to continue to deliver displays throughout 2019 while working closely with Collins Aerospace to further improve the display in preparation for Limited Rate Initial Production, or LRIP.
 Night Vision/Thermal Imaging.  Night vision goggles allow the user to see in low light conditions. Most versions include two different technologies: infrared/thermal and image intensification. Third and fourth generation military devices generally use some combination of the two technologies. Thermal imagers detect infrared energy (heat) and convert it into an electronic signal. The resulting signal needs to be presented on a display. Heat sensed by an infrared camera can be very precisely quantified, or measured, allowing the user to not only monitor thermal performance, but also identify and evaluate the relative severity of heat‑related problems. Thermal imaging systems can be stand‑alone handheld systems or integrated as part of the aiming mechanism for a larger system. Advances in sensor technology, both in sensitivity and resolution as well as economic efficiency, have been the driving factors in the adoption of thermal technologies for military applications. We believe the power efficiency and environmental ruggedness of our products are strong competitive advantages, particularly for smaller handheld non‑cooled systems. Fielded products incorporating our OLED microdisplays include Enhanced Night Vision Goggle II, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III, Family of Weapons Sights—Individual and Crew Served Javelin CLU medium‑range anti‑tank missile system, Laser Targeting Locator Modules, SOPHIEhandheld thermal imagers, and  MINIE, LUCIE, and MONIE night vision goggles.
 Training and Simulation.  Our OLED microdisplays are purchased by OEMs for use with their simulation and training products. Our displays have been commercialized and prototyped for situational awareness and night vision/thermal imaging applications by military systems integrators.  
 Commercial
 We believe that a wide variety of commercial, markets (in which we include the medical and industrial sectors) offer significant opportunities for our products due to increasing demand for instant data accessibility in mobile workplace environments and the benefit of mobile displays to enhance visual performance. This market also includes night and thermal imaging systems for law enforcement and first responders.  Examples of existing and potential microdisplay applications include enhanced visualization for ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound, mobile nondestructive testing, enhanced vision for those with visual impairments, immediate access to inventory records or maintenance and construction manuals, routine quality assurance inspection, and real‑time viewing of images and data for a variety of applications. As an example, a user wearing an HMD while operating test equipment, such as an oscilloscope, can view technical data while simultaneously probing printed circuit boards. Current commercial products equipped with our OLED microdisplays in these sectors include those produced by Alcon, IMV (formerly BCF), Liteye, FLIR Systems, Nordic NeuroLab, VRmagic GmbH, and Sensics. Consumer
 We believe a major driver of the longer term near‑eye virtual imaging microdisplay market is the growing consumer demand for mobile access to larger volumes of information and entertainment in smaller and more affordable packages. This desire for mobility has resulted in the development of mobile video personal viewer products in three general categories: 
· | immersive VR headset‑application platforms such as accessories for gaming computers, and wearable telepresence systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AR electronic viewers incorporated in products such as data glasses and personal viewers for cell phones; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | low cost thermal and low light imaging incorporated in scopes for hunting and other outdoor activities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When we are able to manufacture our OLED displays in higher volumes at reduced costs and capitalize on our direct patterning technology, we believe that our products will be increasingly well positioned to compete with and displace liquid crystal displays and cell phone size displays in the rapidly growing consumer market, particularly as demand expands for sophisticated mobile personal viewers offering higher resolution and better image quality for VR and AR applications. Users of VR HMDs are demanding a fully immersive experience. We believe our direct patterning technology addresses the critical performance parameters for next generation VR HMDs, including higher brightness, sharper resolution, lower power consumption, elimination of motion artifacts and longer life. Our strategy for addressing the consumer mass market includes developing partnerships with both Tier One consumer companies and high volume production manufacturing companies.
 Potential applications for these personal viewers include handheld personal computers and mobile devices, such as smartphones, whose small, direct view screens limit the amount of information that can be displayed but which are now capable of running more complex software applications. Examples encompass applications where hands‑free viewing is desired such as entertainment and gaming video headset systems; night time or thermal imaging devices for hunting, camping, and other outdoor activities; and maintenance applications. In addition, in late 2015, we entered into a HMD technology licensing agreement with a Tier One consumer electronics company which includes the use of our 2K × 2K displays in its consumer headsets. In first quarter 2017, we entered into an agreement with a Tier One company interested in incorporating our proprietary direct patterning technology into potential headset products.  Also during first quarter 2017, we performed tests for a Tier One consumer electronics company demonstrating our dPd technology as a path for AR and VR. We also entered into agreements with Tier One companies to develop a new display design for Virtual Reality and scale our dPd technology.  During 2018 we designed a silicon backplane for this 4K design which is anticipated to have a 100 degree field of view.  In late 2018 we received the first silicon wafers based on our 4K design from a foundry, and began testing and applying OLED materials to the wafers in furtherance of our development efforts.
 Our Products        
 Our first commercial microdisplay, the super video graphics array, or SVGA,+ OLED, was introduced in 2001. In 2008, we introduced engineering samples of our super extended graphics array, or SXGA,120 OLED microdisplays and began selling significant quantities of the product in 2010. In late 2011, we began selling pre‑production samples of our WUXGA OLED microdisplay which is now qualified and in production. In 2014, we released our Digital SVGA, and in 2015, we released our smaller pixel pitch digital SXGA and SXGA096, as well as an upgrade to the SXGA120 and WUXGA. Our OLED display products are being designed in products to be manufactured by OEM customers for a wide variety of military, commercial, and consumer applications. We offer our products to OEMs and other buyers as both separate components, integrated bundles coupled with our own optics, or complete systems. We also offer engineering support to enable customers to integrate our products into their own product development programs and design customized displays with resolutions or features to meet specific customer requirements. In 2015, we announced the development of a prototype immersive headset that uses our prototype 2K × 2K display. During 2016, we demonstrated what we believe to be the world’s first highest brightness (~4,500 cd/m2) and highest resolution (1920x1200 pixels) microdisplay using our proprietary direct patterning method. During 2017, we developed prototype displays of our 2K x 2K display with an advanced backplane design and brightness exceeding 5,000 cd/m2.  During 2018, we continued to make improvements in the features and brightness of our displays and achieved over 7,500 nits in our WUXGA displays. SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series (Super Video Graphics Array of 852x600)
 The SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series is a 0.62 inch diagonal microdisplay that has a resolution of 852x600 triad pixels (1.53 million picture elements). The display also has an internal monochrome video decoder for low power night vision systems. The SVGA+ Rev3 OLED‑XL microdisplay is a power efficient OLED display solution for near‑eye personal viewer applications which uses less than 115 mW power in monochrome for thermal imaging applications, and lower than 175 mW at 200 cd/m2 for full color video. Digital SVGA OLED‑XL
 The Digital SVGA or DSVGA OLED‑XL is an 800 × 600 display with 15 micron pixels and a 0.6 inch diagonal. It has all the benefits of our other digital displays, including lower power (100 mW monochrome and 135 mW color), high (10,000 to 1) contrast, and also features a digital composite signal interface, enabling a minimal physical interface for color applications.
 SXGA096 OLED‑XL/XLS (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)
 The SXGA096 display features a 9.6‑micron color pixel and was designed with the same level of feature integration as the DSVGA microdisplay, as well as a low pin‑count, high speed low voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, data interface. The compactness and high information content of the SXGA096 makes it ideal for small form factor applications such as commercial headsets and smart weapon sights. This microdisplay incorporates OLED XLS technology more than doubling the OLED XL brightness. This expands the range of optical solutions that can be used with this display to result in smaller and lighter display modules.
 SXGA OLED‑XL/XLS (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)
 Our SXGA OLED microdisplay with a 0.77 inch diagonal active area provides 3,932,160 sub‑pixels in an active area. The display’s pixel array comprises triads of vertical sub‑pixels stacked side by side to make up each 12 × 12mm color pixel. The SXGA OLED‑XL microdisplay offers digital signal processing, requiring less than 200mW under typical operation. The supported video formats are SXGA, 720p, DVGA (through 1280 × 960 pixel doubling), and both frame sequential and field sequential stereovision.
 VGA OLED‑XL (Video Graphics Array, 640 x 480)
 The VGA OLED‑XL microdisplay is our smallest (0.5 inches) and lowest powered (<60 mW monochrome/<100 mW color). The VGA OLED‑XL utilizes the same voltage pixel drive architecture and “deep black” technology as the SXGA and WUXGA designs and includes motion artifact reduction technology like the WUXGA. Also like the SXGA and WUXGA, the VGA provides a FPGA driver design for maximum flexibility and versatility. The VGA interface is 30‑bit digital RGB.
 WUXGA OLED‑XL/XLS  (Widescreen Ultra eXtended Graphics Array, 1920 x 1200)
 Our WUXGA OLED‑XL microdisplay provides higher resolution than most high definition, or HD, flat screen televisions. With a triad sub‑pixel structure this display is built of 7,138,360 active dots at 3.2 microns each. The WUXGA OLED‑XL is built upon the voltage pixel drive approach first developed for the SXGA OLED‑XL, which provides improved uniformity, ultra‑high contrast (measured at greater than 100,000:1) and lower power. The advanced WUXGA design features our proprietary “deep black” architecture that ensures that off‑pixels are truly black, automatically optimizes contrast under all conditions, and delivers better pixel to pixel uniformity. The WUXGA OLED‑XL includes a low‑power LVDS, serial interface and the overall display power requirement is typically less than 350 mW running standard video. Also included is our proprietary motion enhancement technology which smooths video display and virtually eliminates unwanted artifacts. Like the SXGA, the WUXGA provides a FPGA driver design available on a separate, lower power driver board, or as source code for integration into end product electronics giving OEM developers maximum versatility and flexibility. On‑board circuitry ensures consistent color and brightness over a wide range of operating temperatures.
 Lens and Design Reference Kits
 We offer a prism optic with mounting brackets or combined with OLED microdisplays to form an optic‑display module. We provide design reference kits, which include a microdisplay and associated electronics, to help OEMs evaluate our microdisplay products and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our microdisplays. Integrated Modules
 We provide near‑eye virtual imaging modules that incorporate our OLED‑on‑silicon microdisplays with our lenses and electronic interfaces for integration into OEM products. We have shipped customized modules to several customers, some of which have incorporated our products into their own commercial products. Prism Optics
 We sell high quality, large viewing angle prism optics with a wide range for eye positioning which are essential for incorporating our displays in immersive near‑eye systems. We have developed advanced molded plastic prism lenses that permit our AMOLED microdisplays to provide realistic images that can be viewed for extended periods with reduced eye‑fatigue. We are developing an additional prism optic for a project that will pair with our SXGA096 display, which is of interest to a potential customer. We are currently evaluating prototypes received from potential manufacturing partners for this project. Night Vision Smartphone Camera Attachment and Goggles
 In 2016, we announced night vision products for the consumer markets and began limited sales in the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter ended June 30, 2018 we made a decision to exit this business.   Our decision was based on lower than anticipated sales and an assessment performed during the quarter of the anticipated level of additional engineering, marketing and financial resources necessary to modify the products for an expanded market.  As a result, we concluded an impairment had occurred and wrote-down the related inventory and production tooling which are reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Government Contract Funding
 We derive a portion of our revenue from funding that we receive pursuant to research contracts or subcontracts funded by various agencies of the U.S. government.
 In 2014, we were awarded a $5 million contract to develop and produce an ultra‑high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, full color OLED microdisplay at a low unit cost. This Defense‑wide Manufacturing Science & Technology award, also known as ManTech, is funded by the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and is administered by the U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate Science and Technology Division. We earned a substantial portion of our R&D contract revenue in 2016 through the completion of this program during 2018 from this contract.  In December 2018, we received a Defense Manufacturing Technology Achievement Award in conjunction with our work on this program.     
 In 2018 we were awarded several government contracts for yield and cycle time improvement in the high volume manufacture of OLED microdisplays.
 Our contracts with the U.S. government require us to conduct the research effort described in the statement of work section of the contract. These contracts may be modified or terminated at the discretion of the government and are subject to authorization, appropriation and allocation of the required funding on an annual basis.
 Commercial Contract Funding
 We also derive a portion of our revenue from funding we receive from customers in both the military and commercial sectors.   During 2018 we were awarded contracts to design a displays for fixed and rotary wing aircraft and to develop a display suitable for use in a consumer AR VR application by one of our customers. Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to strengthen our leadership position as a worldwide supplier of microdisplays and virtual imaging technology solutions for applications in military, commercial, and consumer markets by capitalizing on our experience and expertise in active matrix OLED technology and silicon wafer design. 
 We also plan to continue our participation in U.S. government funded, and commercial contract research and development programs which allow us to continue to advance our technology. We aim to provide microdisplays and complementary accessories to enable OEM customers serving a variety of markets, including military and commercial and consumer to develop and manufacture new and enhanced electronic products.  The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives include:

· | Strengthen our technology leadership. As the first to exploit AMOLED microdisplays and the only participant in U.S. government contract research and development programs for OLED microdisplays, we believe that we enjoy a significant advantage in bringing this technology to market. By continuing to invest in research and development, and protecting our intellectual property, we expect to further develop performance improvements and provide a competitive edge for our customers who integrate our displays into their end products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimize microdisplay manufacturing efficiencies while protecting proprietary processes and partner with large volume manufacturers to bring our technology into high volume production. We intend to reduce our production costs primarily by improving manufacturing yields and lowering fixed costs through reduced cycle time and increased automation as well as equipment upgrades. We outsource certain portions of microdisplay production, such as chip fabrication, to minimize our costs and time to market. We intend to retain the OLED‑related processes in‑house, where we have a core competency and manufacturing expertise. We also believe that by keeping these processes under tight control we can better protect our proprietary technology and process know‑how. We believe that this strategy will also enhance our ability to continue to optimize and customize processes and devices to meet customer needs. In order to address emerging high volume consumer electronics OLED microdisplay requirements, we are actively seeking manufacturing partners who can help us realize that objective.

· | Continue to build and maintain strong design capabilities. We employ in‑house design capabilities supplemented by outsourced design services. Building and maintaining this capability allows us to reduce engineering costs, accelerate the design process and enhance design accuracy to respond to our customers’ needs as new markets develop. Contracting third party design support to meet demand and for specialized design skills may also remain a part of our overall long term strategy. Given these capabilities, we continue to look for opportunities to add value to our displays to increase revenue. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop OEM and mass production partnerships in the consumer and commercial HMD market. As the consumer and enterprise augmented reality/virtual reality, or AR/VR, market matures, we believe our technology is positioned well to address the requirements of this segment. Developing customer partners is key to establishing eMagin as the market leader for next generation displays for the consumer HMD market. Our potential channels to this market include partnering for the mass production of microdisplays and licensing our dPd technology. We believe that our dPd technology will enable next generation AR/VR hardware for the consumer and enterprise segments because the high brightness and high pixel per inch, or PPI, density afforded by the technology. Should we be successful in executing on a mass production partnerships we believe it would allow us to be well positioned to meet the demands of a market predicted to experience significant growth through the 2020s. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage strategic relationships. External relationships serve an important role in our research and development efforts. Suppliers, equipment vendors, government organizations, contract research groups, external design companies, customer and corporate partners, consortia, and university relationships all enhance the overall research and development effort and help us develop new ideas and solutions. In addition, we participate in industry associations such as the Society for Information Display; SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics; the Army Aviation Association of America; and the National Defense Industrial Association; among others. We believe that strategic relationships allow us to determine better the demands of the marketplace and, as a result, allow us to focus our research and development activities on satisfying our customers’ evolving requirements.

  Sales and Marketing
 We primarily provide our OLED display and optics components to OEMs to incorporate into their branded products and sell through their own well‑established distribution channels. We have traditionally marketed and sold our products to customers through targeted selling, promotions, and select advertising. We identify companies with end products and applications for which we believe our products will provide a key differentiator. Marketing efforts focus on identifying prospects and communicating the product performance attributes foremost in the minds of purchasing decision‑makers. We believe that this approach positions us to achieve the highest possible return on investment for our marketing expense.
 We market our products in North America, Asia, and Europe directly from our sales office located at our Hopewell Junction, NY facilities. We also utilize distributors in Asia and Korea.
 ﻿
 An OEM design cycle typically requires between six and 36 months, depending on the uniqueness of the market, the complexity of the end product or, in the case of military OEM customers, government procurement schedules. Because our microdisplays are the main functional component that defines many of our customers’ end products, we work closely with customers to provide technical assistance throughout the product evaluation and integration process.
 ﻿
 Another element of our marketing strategy is discussions with customers and presentations to existing and potential customers at military, industrial and consumer tradeshows. Trade shows we have exhibited at, or plan to exhibit at include; Shot Show, the largest event for the recreational hunting and shooting market, Defense and Commercial Sensing Exposition sponsored by the International Society for Optics and Photonics,  Army Aviation Association of America, Special Operations Force Industry Conference, Defence and Security Equipment International, Association of the United States Army, Eurosatory-France, Land, Naval & Internal Homeland Security Systems Exhibition, the Society for Information Display, Solid State Devices and Materials conference, and the International Meeting on Information Display and OLED World Summit. 
 ﻿
 A key element of our marketing is the expansion of our presence in in new, high potential markets. We are experiencing heightened interest and requests for quotation from a variety of international companies that are familiar with the performance of our microdisplays.  In particular, we are focusing on the rapidly growing the Indian defense/commercial market.  Following our exposure at the DefExpo18 India show in the second quarter of 2018, we began shipping samples for evaluation and testing, generated five new customers, including one from whom we received a production quantity order during the third quarter of 2018.
 ﻿
 Customers  
     We sell our products directly to military contractors and OEM’s who use our displays in a diverse range of applications encompassing the military, and commercial (in which we include the medical and industrial market sectors). We classify revenues as either Military, Commercial, Consumer or Multiple based on our knowledge of the customer’s products and markets served by our displays.  Revenues classified as Multiple are for sales to  customers that incorporate our displays in products that could be used for either Military or Commercial applications.   R&D activities are performed for both military customers and U.S. Government defense related agencies. Product and Contract revenues are disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We maintain relationships with OEMs in a diverse range of industries encompassing the military, commercial, and consumer market sectors. The following table estimates revenues by market sectors.

 Backlog
     As of December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of approximately $10.6 million, an increase of approximately $800 thousand over the backlog of $9.8 million at December 31, 2017.  Backlog is comprised of scheduled delivery dates through 2019 of non-binding customer purchase orders and purchase agreements, but does not include expected revenue from research and development contracts or expected non-recurring engineering programs under development. Backlog also does not include purchase orders for which deliveries are not or have not yet been scheduled. Our backlog may vary depending upon the timing of when orders are received and shipment dates scheduled, although we are generally seeing continuing growth in our year-over-year backlog.  Variations in the magnitude and duration of purchase orders and customer delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period.  Many of our purchase orders allow for rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties.     Manufacturing Facilities  
     Our manufacturing facilities are located in Hopewell Junction, NY. We lease approximately 42,000 square feet of space which houses our own equipment for OLED microdisplay fabrication and research and development, includes a 16,300 square foot class 10 clean room space, additional lower level clean room testing space, assembly space and administrative offices.
 ﻿
 Facilities services provided by the lessor at our expense include our clean room, pure gases, high purity de-ionized water, compressed air, chilled water systems, and waste disposal support. This infrastructure provided by our lease provides us with many of the resources of a larger corporation without the added overhead costs. It further allows us to focus our resources more efficiently on our product development and manufacturing goals.
     We believe manufacturing efficiency is an important factor for success, especially in the consumer markets. We purchased $2.3 million and $1.4 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, of additional equipment mainly related to manufacturing operations. Although we experienced lower production yields and output in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the failure of certain production equipment in our manufacturing line, we plan to add new equipment in fiscal 2019 to increase capacity and yield, address critical productions points and replace certain older equipment (including the equipment that failed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018), which we expect will help us meet expected demand for our microdisplays.
 ﻿
 Competition    
     The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We face competition from legacy technologies such as transmissive liquid crystal displays and liquid crystal on silicon displays as well as from alternative display technologies such as virtual scanning retinal displays. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies.
 We are the only company with U.S.-based manufacturing capability for OLED microdisplays.  There are other non-U.S. based manufacturers of high resolution OLED microdisplays that produce microdisplays that compete with our microdisplay products. They are Yunnan OLiGHTECK Opto‑Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. in China and MicroOLED in France. Both are shipping OLED microdisplays into the market. Sony Mobile Display Corp., in Japan, produces OLED microdisplays for integration into Sony’s own higher‑level systems such as digital cameras and HMDs and is now selling microdisplays to some commercial customers. In addition, in early 2017, Kopin Corporation announced a 2K × 2K microdisplay which includes OLEDs sourced from a Chinese manufacturer.
 If other new OLED‑based companies enter our markets we will face additional competition.  
 In addition, we compete with liquid crystal on silicon displays, small transmissive liquid crystal displays, and OLED microdisplays manufactured by competitors. While we believe our OLED technology is technically superior by providing higher quality images, greater environmental ruggedness, reduced electronics cost and complexity, and improved power efficiency microdisplays, there is no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively. Competition can also come from inorganic micro LEDs, a technology still in the development stage but which could become a major competitor if all the technological hurdles are overcome.
 Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors to include:

· | our ability to design, manufacture and deliver new products, including those implementing dPd, on a timely basis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to address the needs of our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use and pricing of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | successful expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | our efficiency of production, and ability to manufacture and ship products on time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the rate at which OEM customers incorporate our product solutions into their own products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the market acceptance of our customers’ products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | product or technology introductions by our competitors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, our customers may be reluctant to rely on a relatively small company such as eMagin for a critical component. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.    Intellectual Property
 We have developed an intellectual property portfolio of patents, trade secrets and manufacturing know‑how. Our intellectual property includes 32 U.S. patents and 24 pending U.S. patent applications (two of which have received a Notice of Allowance). It is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including rights under patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the United States and other countries when appropriate. The U.S. government holds licenses to much of our technology as a result of its funding a significant portion of our research and development.
 Our intellectual property covers a wide range of materials, device structures, processes, and fabrication techniques, primarily concentrated in the following areas:

· | OLED devices, architecture, structures, and processes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | Display color processing and sealing;
--+--------------------------------------


· | Active matrix circuit methodologies and designs;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Lenses and tracking (eye and head);
--+------------------------------------


· | Ergonomics and industrial design;
--+----------------------------------


· | Wearable computer interface methodology;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Legacy field emission and general display technologies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | Head‑mounted display technology.
--+---------------------------------

  We believe that, in addition to patent protection, our success is dependent upon trade secrets, technical expertise and know‑how. To protect this information and know‑how from unauthorized use or disclosure, we use nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights, and we require all employees and, where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non‑competition agreements. In addition we work to continually improve our IT security posture through, among other things; network monitoring, enhancements to firewalls, antivirus and malware prevention software, email spam blockers, and end user security training.  We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our strategic relationships and accumulated manufacturing know‑how in OLED, gives us a significant advantage over potential competitors.
 US Government Regulation
 We are subject to certain export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR or by the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, or DDTC, under the ITAR. Most of our ITAR products are custom displays developed for a specific military program or purpose. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Environmental Law Compliance
 Our operations are subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, experimental and other hazardous chemicals used in our design and manufacturing process. While we continue to incur costs to comply with environmental regulations, we do not believe that such costs will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations, we cannot be certain that we or our suppliers have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations. Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 105 employees, of which 103 were full time.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union.  We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.     Available Information
