ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Chuy’s is a growing, full-service restaurant concept offering a distinct menu of authentic, freshly-prepared Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired food. We were founded in Austin, Texas in 1982. As of December 26, 2021, we operated 96 restaurants across 17 states, with an average annual unit volume of $4.2 million for our 92 comparable restaurants. Our restaurants have common décor, but we believe each location is unique in format, offering an “unchained” look and feel, as expressed by our motto “If you’ve seen one Chuy’s, you’ve seen one Chuy’s!” We believe our restaurants have an upbeat, funky, eclectic, somewhat irreverent atmosphere while still maintaining a family-friendly environment. We are committed to providing value to our customers through offering generous portions of made-from-scratch, flavorful Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired dishes. We believe our employees are the cornerstone of our culture and set the tone for a fun, family-friendly atmosphere with attentive service. We believe the Chuy’s culture is one of our most valuable assets, and we are committed to preserving and continually investing in our culture and our customers’ restaurant experience.
Our core menu was established using recipes from family and friends of our founders, and has remained relatively unchanged over the years. We offer the same menu for both lunch and dinner, which includes enchiladas, fajitas, tacos, burritos, combination platters, soups and salads complemented by a variety of appetizers and desserts. Each of our restaurants also offers a variety of homemade sauces, including our signature Hatch Green Chile, Boom-Boom and Creamy Jalapeño sauces, all of which we make from scratch daily in each restaurant. These sauces are a key element of our offering and provide our customers with an added ability to customize their orders. During the COVID-19 pandemic the Company offered a limited menu featuring a number of long-time favorites and introduced convenient family meal and beverage kits. At the beginning of fiscal year 2022 we added several popular items back to our menu, including fan favorites Baja Shrimp Tacos, Tex-Mex Enchilada, the Elvis Presley Memorial Combo and the Comida Deluxe combination platter. We also introduced a new dessert, Chuy Chuy Churro Bites, continuing to focus on providing unique food offerings. Our menu offers considerable value to our customers with an average check of $17.30 as of December 26, 2021, which we believe is on the lower end of our casual dining peer group. We also offer a full-service bar in all of our restaurants providing our customers a wide variety of beverage offerings, featuring a selection of specialty cocktails including our signature on-the-rocks margaritas made with fresh, hand-squeezed lime juice and the King's Punch, a made-to-order, hand-shaken rum cocktail served in our signature shaker. The bar represents an important aspect of our concept, where customers frequently gather prior to being seated. For the twelve months ended December 26, 2021, alcoholic beverages constituted approximately 16% of our total restaurant sales.
We strive to create a unique and memorable customer experience at each of our locations. While the layout in each of our restaurants varies, we maintain distinguishable elements across our locations, including hand-carved, hand-painted wooden fish imported from Mexico, a variety of vibrant Mexican folk art, vintage hubcaps hanging from the ceiling, colorful hand-made floor and wall tile and festive metal palm trees. Including patio space, our restaurants range in size from 5,300 to 12,200 square feet, with seating for approximately 200 to 400 customers. Nearly all of our restaurants feature outdoor patios. We design our restaurants to have flexible seating arrangements that allow us to cater to families and parties of all sizes. Our brand strategy of having an “unchained” look and feel allows our restaurants to establish their own identity and provides us with a flexible real estate model. Our site selection process is focused on conversions of existing restaurants as well as new ground-up prototypes in select locations. Our restaurants are open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. We serve approximately 4,600 customers per location per week or 239,000 customers per location per year, on average, by providing high-quality, freshly prepared food at a competitive price point. We believe that many of Chuy’s frequent customers visit one of our restaurants multiple times per week.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of the first quarter of 2020 caused significant disruptions to the Company's business operations as a result of mandatory closures, imposed capacity limitations and other restrictions. During fiscal 2020, the Company took various steps to reduce nonessential spend, postpone restaurant development and rightsize operations in light of reduced sales volume to improve our store level profitability and increase our cash flows. As of June 28, 2020, the Company reopened all of its dining rooms to varying degrees of operating capacity. The Company started to relax its indoor dining capacity restrictions during the second quarter of 2021 and, as of December 26, 2021, all restaurants operated without restrictions.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company developed a new operating model to address increased off-premise business with proportionately lower indoor dining. This allowed the Company to rightsize its labor model and maximize its restaurant level operating profit at reduced sales volumes. The Company continues to be subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The challenging labor market, commodity inflation pressures and supply chain shortages across many industries continue to increase costs to operate and stress our business. We cannot predict our ability to continue to 

operate without capacity limitations in the future which will depend in part on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control, the efficacy and public acceptance of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus, the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus, which may prove resistant to currently approved vaccines, and new or reinstated restrictions on our operations. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors—COVID-19 has harmed our business and may continue to do so" for additional information. 
Our Business Strengths
Over our 39-year operating history, we have developed and refined the following strengths:
Fresh, Authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex Inspired Cuisine. Our goal is to provide unique, authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired food using only the freshest ingredients. We believe we serve authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired food based on our recipes, ingredients, cooking techniques and food pairings, which originated from our founders’ friends and families from Texas, Mexico and New Mexico. Every day in each restaurant, we roast and hand-pull chicken, make fresh tortillas, squeeze fresh lime juice and prepare fresh guacamole from whole avocados. In addition, we make all of our homemade sauces daily using high-quality ingredients. We believe this commitment to made-from-scratch, freshly prepared cooking results in great tasting, high-quality food, a sense of pride among our restaurant employees and loyalty among our customers. Our culinary team travels to Hatch, New Mexico every summer to hand-select batches of our green chiles. We believe our commitment to serving high-quality food is also evidenced by serving only Choice quality beef and fresh ingredients. We believe our servers and kitchen staff are highly proficient in executing the core menu and capable of satisfying large quantities of custom orders, as the majority of our orders are personalized.
Considerable Dining Value with Broad Customer Appeal. We are committed to providing value to our customers through offering generous portions of flavorful Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired dishes using fresh, high-quality ingredients. We believe our menu offers a considerable value proposition to our customers with an average check of $17.30 as of December 26, 2021, which we believe is on the lower end of our casual dining peer group. Through our training programs, we teach our employees to make sure that each plate is prepared according to our presentation and recipe standards.
Although our core demographic is ages 21 to 44, we believe our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of customers and will continue to benefit from trends in consumers’ preferences. We believe consumers are craving bold, spicy and flavorful foods, like those featured in our core offering. Additionally, we believe our brand appeals to a wide demographic and will continue to benefit from the growing demand for fresh, authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired food and a fun, festive dining experience. We believe we are also an attractive venue for families and other large parties, and consider some of our restaurants to be destination locations, drawing customers from as far as 30 miles away. We locate our restaurants in high-traffic locations to attract primarily local patrons and weekday business travelers.
Upbeat Atmosphere Coupled with Irreverent Brand Helps Differentiate Concept. As stated in our motto “If you’ve seen one Chuy’s, you’ve seen one Chuy’s!” each of our restaurants is uniquely designed. However, most share a few common elements—hand-carved, hand-painted wooden fish, vintage hubcaps hanging from the ceiling, colorful hand-made floor and wall tile, palm trees hand-crafted from scrap metal and a variety of colorful Mexican folk art. Much of this décor, including all of the wooden fish and painted tiles, is sourced from vendors in Mexican villages that have partnered with us for decades.
We believe these signature elements, combined with attentive service from our friendly and energetic employees create an upbeat ambience with a funky, eclectic and somewhat irreverent atmosphere. Our restaurants feature a fun mix of rock and roll music, which we believe helps to provide an energetic customer experience. We also believe that each restaurant reflects the character of its individual community. Many of our restaurants have added unique, local elements such as a special "dog wall" featuring framed photos of our customer's furry friends. We believe this has allowed our customers to develop a strong sense of pride and ownership in their local Chuy’s.
Deep Rooted and Inspiring Company Culture. We believe the Chuy’s culture is one of our most valuable assets, and we are committed to preserving and continually investing in our culture and restaurant experience. Since our founding in 1982, we believe we have developed close personal relationships with our customers, employees and vendors. We emphasize a fun, passionate and authentic culture and encourage active social responsibility and involvement in local communities. We regularly sponsor a variety of community fundraisers and other local charitable events, including our largest annual toy drive campaign for Operation Blue Santa in our hometown of Austin, Texas. We also support St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on their annual pin-up campaign, raising money and awareness for childhood cancer treatments. We believe our employees and customers share a unique energy and passion for our concept. We believe these characteristics contribute to our favorable annual employee turnover rate at our comparable restaurants and our goal of promoting a significant number of restaurant-level managers from within, as well as our solid base of repeat customers.
In order to retain our unique culture as we grow, we invest significant time and capital into our training programs. We devote substantial resources to identifying, selecting and training our restaurant-level employees. We believe our focus on cultural training is a core aspect of our Company and reinforces our commitment to the Chuy’s brand identity. In conjunction with our 

training activities, we hold “Culture Clubs” several times per year, as a means to fully impart the Chuy’s history through personal stories of our founders.
Flexible Business Model with Industry Leading Unit Economics. We have a long standing track record of consistently producing high average unit volumes relative to competing Mexican concepts, as well as established casual dining restaurants. For the twelve months ended December 26, 2021, our comparable restaurants generated average unit volumes of $4.2 million, with our highest volume comparable restaurant generating approximately $9.7 million. We have opened and operated restaurants in Texas, the Southeast and the Midwest and achieved attractive rates of return on our invested capital, providing a strong foundation for expansion in both new and existing markets. Under our investment model, our new restaurant openings have historically required a net cash investment of approximately $2.5 million.
Experienced Management Team. We are led by a management team with significant experience in all aspects of restaurant operations. As of December 26, 2021 our senior management team had an average of approximately 37 years of restaurant experience and our 96 general managers had an average tenure at Chuy’s of approximately 8 years. In 2007, we hired our CEO and President, Steve Hislop. Since Mr. Hislop’s arrival in 2007, we have opened, and continue to operate, 88 new restaurants across the U.S. as of December 26, 2021.
Our Business Strategies
Pursue New Restaurant Development. We plan to identify and pursue major markets for expansion, where we believe we can achieve high unit volumes and attractive unit level returns, while at the same time backfilling our existing markets to continue to build brand awareness. We believe the broad appeal of the Chuy’s concept, historical unit economics and flexible real estate strategy enhance the portability of our concept and provide us opportunity for continued expansion. Currently, our new restaurant development primarily consists of ground up construction and conversions of existing structures. 
We have built a scalable infrastructure and have grown our restaurant base through a challenging economic environment. We opened six restaurants backfilling existing markets and closed six under-performing restaurants in 2019. We opened one new restaurant in 2020 and postponed four new store openings to 2021 as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We opened four new restaurants in 2021. During 2022, we plan to open a total of five to eight restaurants in existing markets.
Deliver Consistent Comparable Restaurant Sales Through Providing High-Quality Food and Service. We believe we will be able to generate comparable restaurant sales growth by consistently providing an attractive price/value proposition for our customers with excellent service in an upbeat atmosphere. We remain focused on delivering freshly prepared, authentic, high-quality Mexican and Tex-Mex inspired cuisine at a considerable value to our customers. Though the core menu will remain unchanged, we will continue to explore potential additions as well as limited time food and drink offerings. Additionally, we will continue to promote our brand and drive traffic through local marketing efforts, national digital marketing campaigns, social media influencers and charity partnerships, as well as our broad-ranging line of t-shirts. 
We prioritize customer service in our restaurants, and will continue to invest significantly in ongoing training of our employees. In addition to our new manager's training program and frequent “Culture Clubs,” our trainers are dispatched to open new restaurants and ensure a solid foundation of customer service, food preparation and our cultured environment. We believe these initiatives will help enhance customer satisfaction, minimize wait times and help us serve our customers more efficiently during peak periods, which we believe is particularly important at our restaurants that operate at or near capacity.
Leverage Our Infrastructure. In preparation for our new restaurant development plan, we have made investments in our infrastructure over the past several years. We believe we now have the corporate and restaurant-level supervisory personnel in place to support our growth plan for the foreseeable future without significant additional investments in infrastructure. Therefore, we believe that as the restaurant base grows, our general and administrative costs are expected to increase at a slower growth rate than our revenue.
Real Estate
As of December 26, 2021, we leased 106 locations, of which 91 are free-standing restaurants and 15 are end-cap or in-line restaurants in Class A locations and 9 of which are closed and 2 of which will open in fiscal 2022. We also own two properties with a free-standing restaurant in Indiana and Oklahoma. End-cap restaurants are highly visible locations at one of the ends of a retail development whereas in-line restaurants are locations that are between multiple retail locations within a development. Class A locations are upscale properties with easily identifiable locations and convenient access that are surrounded by other upscale properties. Including patio space, our restaurants range in size from approximately 5,300 to 12,200 square feet, averaging approximately 8,500 square feet with seating capacity for approximately 200 to 400 customers. All of our leases provide for base (fixed) rent, plus some provide for additional rent based on gross sales (as defined in each lease agreement) in excess of a stipulated amount, multiplied by a stated percentage. A significant percentage of our leases also provide for periodic escalation of minimum annual rent either based upon increases in the Consumer Price Index or a pre-determined schedule. Typically, the initial terms of our leases are 10 or 15 years in length with two to three, five-year extension options. The initial terms of our leases currently expire between 2022 and 2040. We are also generally obligated to pay certain real estate taxes, 

insurances, common area maintenance charges and various other expenses related to the properties. Our corporate headquarters is also leased and is located at 1623 Toomey Road, Austin, Texas 78704. 
Site Selection Process
We developed a targeted site acquisition and qualification process incorporating management’s experience as well as extensive data collection, analysis and interpretation. We recently implemented a full-service spatial analytics tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of new market potential, customer profiling and site selection, which will enhance our site acquisition and qualification process in future years. We seek to identify sites that contribute to our “If you’ve seen one Chuy’s, you’ve seen one Chuy’s” vision, meaning no two restaurants are alike. As we do not have standardized restaurant requirements with respect to size, location or layout, we are able to be flexible in our real estate selection process. In line with this strategy, we prefer to identify a combination of conversion sites as well as ground-up prototypes. We currently pursue restaurants in existing major markets with proven high average unit volumes.
Our Real Estate and Development team works with a master broker who is responsible for identifying and working with local brokers to conduct preliminary research regarding possible development locations. This master broker also assists in site selection and market research. The preliminary research includes an analysis of traffic patterns, parking, access, demographic characteristics, population density, hotel occupancy, major employers, restaurant sales, level of affluence and current or expected co-retail and restaurant tenants. The key criteria for a potential site is the population within a three mile radius of the restaurant has a high concentration of our target demographic, which is persons ages 21 to 44 and persons with median income ranges in excess of $60,000 per year that dine out frequently. We also seek locations with high visibility, especially in a new market, and ample surface parking spaces. If our financial criteria are met, our Vice Presidents of Operations and Chief Executive Officer visit potential sites and then management negotiates leases. 
Design
After identifying a site, we commence our restaurant buildout. We strive to create a unique and memorable customer experience at each of our locations. While the layout in each of our restaurants varies, we maintain certain distinguishable elements across virtually all locations – hand-carved, hand-painted wooden fish imported from Mexico, a variety of vibrant Mexican folk art, vintage hubcaps hanging from the ceiling, colorful hand-made floor and wall tile and festive metal palm trees. Nearly all of our restaurants feature outdoor patios. Additionally, our flexible seating arrangements allow us to cater to families and parties of all sizes including larger groups, which we believe is a key differentiator from other casual dining operators.
Our new restaurants are either ground-up prototypes or conversions. For our new unit openings in 2022, we estimate the cost of a conversion or ground-up buildout will require a total cash investment of $3.0 million to $4.0 million. The flexibility of our concept has enabled us to open restaurants in a wide variety of locations, including high-density residential areas and near shopping malls, lifestyle centers and other high-traffic locations. On average, it takes us approximately 14 to 18 months from identification of the specific site to opening the doors for business. In order to maintain consistency of food and customer service as well as the unique atmosphere at our restaurants, we have set processes and timelines to follow for all restaurant openings.
The development and construction of our new sites is the responsibility of our real estate and development team. Several project managers are responsible for building the restaurants, and several staff members manage purchasing, budgeting, scheduling and other related administrative functions.
New Restaurant Development
Management believes we are well-positioned to continue our growth through our new restaurant pipeline, which includes locations currently under development. We maintain a commitment to capitalizing on opportunities and realizing efficiencies in our existing markets. Additionally, we seek to identify new markets in which we believe there is capacity for us to open multiple restaurants.
Restaurant Operations
We currently have twenty supervisors that report directly to our four Vice Presidents of Operations who in turn report to our Chief Operating Officer. Each supervisor oversees an average of approximately four to six restaurants. The staffing at our restaurants typically consists of a general manager, a kitchen manager and three to five assistant managers. In addition, each of our restaurants employs approximately 60 hourly employees.
Sourcing and Supply
We rely on one national distributor, Performance Food Group (“PFG”), and various other suppliers to provide our beef, cheese, beans, soybean oil, beverages and our groceries. Our national distributor makes deliveries to each restaurant two to three times each week. Our distributor relationship with PFG has been in place for approximately nine years and covers all of our locations. For our chicken products, we rely on two suppliers for all of our locations. For our green chiles, each year we contract with a 

supplier from a group of farmers in Hatch, New Mexico. If and to the extent the farmers are unable or do not supply a sufficient amount of green chiles or if we need chiles out of season, we purchase the excess amount from several approved suppliers. Each restaurant, through its general manager and kitchen manager, purchases its produce locally. Changes in the price or availability of certain food products could affect the profitability of certain food items, our ability to maintain existing prices and our ability to purchase sufficient amounts of items to satisfy our customers’ demands.
We are currently under contract with our principal non-alcoholic beverage providers through approximately the end of fiscal 2027 based on the estimated consumption rates. Our ability to arrange national distribution of alcoholic beverages is restricted by state law; however, where possible, we negotiate directly with spirit companies and/or regional distributors. We also contract with a third-party provider to source our cooking oil. 
Food Safety 
Providing a safe and clean dining experience for our customers is essential to our mission statement. We have taken steps to control food quality and safety risks, including implementing a training program for our kitchen staff, employees and managers focusing on food safety and quality assurance. In addition, to minimize the risk of food-borne illness, we have implemented a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) system for managing food safety and quality. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers. Our suppliers are inspected by federal, state and local regulators or other reputable, qualified inspection services, which helps ensure their compliance with all federal food safety and quality guidelines.
Building Our Brand
We believe our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of customers due to our freshly-prepared food and beverage offerings, attentive service and fun dining experience. Our target demographic is persons ages 21 to 44 and persons with median income in excess of $60,000 per year that dine out frequently. We aim to build our brand image and awareness at the company level while retaining local neighborhood relationships. We achieve this through digital initiatives and targeted traditional advertising that attract new customers combined with local store marketing initiatives aimed at increasing the frequency of visits by our current customers. We partner with a national media advertising agency and a full-service creative agency to plan our marketing strategy and our core creative direction. At the local level, we primarily foster relationships with schools, hotels, businesses, sports teams and neighborhood associations and sponsor local charity events. We also focus on generating significant brand awareness at new restaurant openings.
Digital Marketing
We have increased our digital presence through paid search and social media, paid influencer campaigns and online listings. Our increased social media presence, primarily on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, has enabled us to reach a significant number of people in a timely fashion and at a low cost. We have a Facebook page and a social media champion for every restaurant, allowing us to connect to the community with local content and celebrate our people and our culture. In addition to reaching a larger audience with targeted messaging and radius geo-fencing, we are gathering more accurate demographic information and insight into our customers' behaviors. Our Online Ordering and Table Management platforms are fully integrated with our digital initiatives, generating additional customer data points. We are able to use these data points to drive our behavioral e-mail marketing campaigns.
Local Store Marketing
Since our founding in 1982, Chuy’s success has stemmed from close personal relationships with our customers, employees and vendors. We believe the Chuy’s culture, which emphasizes fun and authenticity while fostering social responsibility and involvement in local communities, is one of our most valuable assets, and we are committed to preserving and continually investing in it.
A key aspect of our local restaurant marketing/branding strategy is developing community relationships. Our restaurant managers are closely involved in developing and implementing our local store marketing initiatives.
We regularly support a variety of community events, primarily focusing on helping children's charities. For over 33 years, we have fundraised for Operation Blue Santa in Austin, Texas. Operation Blue Santa provides gifts and holiday meals to families in need in Central Texas. Other local events we have sponsored include the Youth for Tomorrow Golf Classic in Northern Virginia, the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital River of Hope Radiothon in Nashville, Tennessee and the University of Kentucky Children's Hospital Survivor's Picnic in Lexington, Kentucky.
Off-Premise
We have increased our brand awareness outside of the four walls through our off-premise initiatives. Our restaurant To Go specialists take care of traditional phoned-in To Go orders and build relationships with local businesses to increase To Go orders to customers who are unable to come to our restaurants. We have fully implemented our Online Ordering platform, 

allowing customers to directly order Chuy's from their computers or smart devices for pick up or delivery. We have added catering vans, equipment and a dedicated Catering Manager to several of our major markets. The Company partners with third party delivery services to create another channel for new and existing customers to be exposed to our brand. DoorDash is currently our preferred national delivery partner. Among other benefits, we believe this partnership will reduce the overall delivery costs and increase efficiencies in the third party delivery process. 
New Restaurant Openings
We have a marketing strategy that we use in connection with opening new restaurants to help build local brand recognition and create a “buzz”. We engage local public relations partners to assist us with earned media coverage, identifying events for Chuy’s to be a part of, establishing relationships with local charities and networking with community leaders. We strategically choose community events in the months leading up to our opening date to promote the new location and build local relationships. We employ a variety of pre-opening marketing initiatives such as paid social media promotions, delivering free food to businesses highlighting our defining differences, fundraising for our charity partner and hosting a dog event to collect pictures for our “dog wall.” 
Management Information Systems
All of our restaurants utilize computerized management information systems, which are designed to improve operating efficiencies, provide restaurant and corporate office with timely access to financial and operating data and reduce administrative time and expense. Our point-of-sale system ("POS") services all of our restaurants and allows for easy integrations from other business applications. Our POS processes payments, collection of cash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. We also use an enterprise back office software program in all of our locations. This program compiles our sales, accounts payable, payroll, inventory and purchasing information and communicates that information to our headquarters to provide visibility into our restaurant level operations. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurants is provided and coordinated with our headquarters in Austin, TX. 
We accept credit cards as a method of payment at all of our restaurants. In addition, we offer secure web-based credit card payment options utilizing QR codes and Text to Pay. In an effort to provide the best security to our customers' credit card information, we utilize P2Pe solution, an encryption platform, to ensure that no credit card data is stored in our internal systems. We also use equipment that can process smart payment cards, commonly referred to as EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) for credit card processing. In addition, we deployed industry-leading switching and firewall protection at all company owned internet connections. This allowed us to increase our visibility into the use of our private network, and enhanced our ability to detect malicious or improper digital activity. We also periodically assess our networks for vulnerability.
We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates position us well to support our business.
Government Regulation
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, including the alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, zoning and public safety agencies in the states or municipalities in which our restaurants are located. Many jurisdictions where our restaurants are located required mandatory closures or imposed capacity limitations and other restrictions affecting our operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
For the twelve months ended December 26, 2021, approximately 16% of our total restaurant sales were attributable to alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities, for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and staff members consuming or serving these beverages, respectively; staff member alcoholic beverage training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of these beverages; the seating of minors and the servicing of food within our bar areas; special menus and events, such as happy hours; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject to “dram shop” statutes in most of the states in which we operate, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws affecting our business, including (1) laws relating to (a) immigration, employment, minimum wages, breaks, overtime, tip credits, worker conditions and health care, (b) nutritional labeling, nutritional content, menu labeling and food safety and (c) information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, (2) the Americans with Disabilities Act, which, among other things, requires our restaurants to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled, and (3) environmental regulations concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, such as cleaning solvents, and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations. During fiscal 2021, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, and no such expenditures are anticipated.
Intellectual Property
We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand and differentiating our brand from our competitors. We currently own registrations from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the following trademarks: Chuy’s; Chuy’s Mil Pescados Bar (stylized lettering); Chuy’s Green Chile Festival; Fish with sunglasses (our emblematic fish design); and Chuy’s Children Giving to Children Parade, which we have the right to use under an agreement with our founders. We have also registered our chuys.com domain name. However, as a result of our settlement agreement with an unaffiliated entity, Baja Chuy's Mesquite Broiler, Inc. ("Baja Chuy’s"), we may not use “Chuy’s” in Nevada, California or Arizona. An important part of our intellectual property strategy is the monitoring and enforcement of our rights in markets in which our restaurants currently exist or markets which we intend to enter in the future. We also monitor trademark registers to oppose the applications to register confusingly similar trademarks or to limit the expansion of the scope of goods and services covered by existing similar trademarks. We enforce our rights through a number of methods, including the issuance of cease-and-desist letters or making infringement claims in federal court.
Competition 
The restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price/value relationships, ambience, service and location, and is affected by many factors, including changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns, macroeconomic conditions, demographic trends, weather conditions, the cost and availability of raw materials, labor and energy and government regulations. Our main competitors are full service concepts in the multi-location, casual dining segment in which we compete most directly for real estate locations and customers, including Texas Roadhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen and BJ’s Restaurants. We also compete with other providers of Tex-Mex and Mexican fare and adjacent segments, including casual and fast casual segments. We believe we compete favorably for consumers on our food quality, price/value and unique ambience and experience of our restaurants.
Seasonality 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations with restaurant sales typically higher during the spring and summer months. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may affect customer traffic. In addition, at nearly all of our restaurants, we have outdoor seating, and the effects of adverse weather may impact the use of these areas and may negatively impact our revenues.
Human Capital Management 
As of December 26, 2021, we had approximately 6,700 employees, including 100 corporate management and staff personnel, 500 restaurant level managers and 6,100 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. Our employees are a cornerstone of our culture and set the tone for a fun, family-friendly atmosphere with attentive service. 
We devote significant resources to identifying, selecting and training restaurant-level employees, with a several month long training program for all of our restaurant managers that includes restaurant training and “cultural” training, in which managers observe our established restaurants’ operations and customer interactions. We typically have in-store trainers at each existing location who provide both front- and back-of-the-house training on site. We conduct comprehensive training programs for our management, hourly employees and corporate personnel. Our training program covers leadership, team building, food safety certification, alcohol safety programs, customer service philosophy training, sexual harassment training and other topics.
Our training process in connection with opening new restaurants has been refined over the course of our experience. Trainers oversee and conduct both service and kitchen training and are on site through the first two weeks of opening and remain on site as needed and depending on unit volumes during the initial weeks. We have one front- and one back-of-the-house training coordinators, and these training coordinators remain on-site to manage the opening with our other trainers. The lead and other trainers assist in opening new locations and lend support and introduce our standards and culture to the new team. We believe that hiring the best available team members and committing to their training helps keep retention high during the restaurant opening process. We are proud of our annual employee turnover rate at comparable restaurants, which as of December 26, 2021, was approximately 25% for store managers and 94% for hourly employees, which we believe is one of the lowest in the fast-casual dining segment.
Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is a key strategic focus and drives our relationship with our customers, shareholders, business partners, communities and employees and enhances and differentiates our brand reputation. We devote substantial resources to provide extensive cultural training to our employees. In conjunction with our training activities, we hold “Culture Clubs” several times per year, as a means of fully imparting Chuy’s history through personal stories of our founders.
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority, particularly in our re-opened restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. We follow all COVID-19 protocols in accordance with CDC, OSHA and state and local regulations. In protecting our employees’ safety, we have invested in creating a safe work environment by taking additional measures. For our office 

employees, we have added work from home flexibility and mandatory COVID-19 protocol to be followed at the corporate office. For our restaurant employees, we have increased cleaning protocols and provided additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies.
