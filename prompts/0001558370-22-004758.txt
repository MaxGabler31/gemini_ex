Item 1. Business 
Overview
We are a women’s healthcare company dedicated to fulfilling the unmet health needs of today’s women. We are committed to innovating in women’s healthcare where there continues to be unmet needs – not only in contraception – but also in other meaningful women’s health therapeutic areas. 
Our first and only product, Twirla, which was approved in February 2020 and launched in early December 2020, is a once-weekly prescription combination hormonal contraceptive patch. It delivers a dose of estrogen that is consistent with commonly prescribed combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs, and is lower than the estrogen dose found in other marketed contraceptive patches. We believe there is a market need for a contraceptive patch that is designed to deliver 30 mcg of estrogen and 120 mcg of progestin in a convenient, once-weekly dosage form that may support compliance in a noninvasive fashion. Twirla leverages our proprietary transdermal patch technology called Skinfusion®. Skinfusion is designed to allow drug delivery through the skin while optimizing patch adhesion and patient comfort and wearability, which may help support compliance.
Since the approval of Twirla we have focused on our advancement as a commercial company. Over the course of 2021, the first year of Twirla’s commercial launch, we have seen consistent growth in Twirla prescriptions and a broadening of reimbursement and patient access. We have designed our commercial plan to attempt to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and market conditions, including a challenging reimbursement environment, and continue to implement tactics that we believe will further accelerate growth of the Twirla brand. Our ultimate goal remains to become a contraceptive market leader, while pursuing opportunities to broaden our portfolio to address areas of unmet medical need in additional areas of women’s health. 
​
Our Strategy
 Our near-term goal is to establish an initial franchise in the multi-billion-dollar U.S. hormonal contraceptive market built on commercialization of Twirla in the U.S. Our resources are currently focused on enhancing the commercialization and increased uptake of Twirla. To that end, in the second half of 2021, we concentrated our marketing efforts on increasing both patient awareness and access through digital advertising to consumers in our target market and strategic partnering. In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Sterling Specialty Pharmacy, a national specialty pharmacy, that provides benefits adjudication support to patients and allows them to receive Twirla through the mail. In August 2021, we entered into an agreement with Pandia Health that, for the first time, makes Twirla available through a telemedicine platform in the states in which it operates. In addition, in October 2021, we implemented an eVoucher program that seamlessly allows commercially insured patients experiencing coverage issues to obtain Twirla at a low 

4



cost at the retail pharmacy level. During 2021, we also partnered with different group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, to bring Twirla to a wider population of patients. For example, an agreement with Afaxys GPO will make Twirla available to patients served by public health clinics, including Planned Parenthood and student health centers. At the same time, we entered into a co-promotion agreement with Afaxys Pharma, LLC, a sister entity to the Afaxys GPO, that will promote Twirla to the accounts maintained by Afaxys to capitalize on the potential of our partnership with the Afaxys GPO. These efforts have contributed to the growth of Twirla in the face of challenges presented by the current reimbursement environment, which at times included public reports of potential violations by payors of the contraceptive coverage requirement of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We also expect to explore possible expansion through business development activities, such as acquiring access to new products through in-licensing, co-promotion or other collaborative arrangements.
Our current priorities are as follows:

●Continue to implement our commercialization plans for Twirla to increase uptake of Twirla in the United States, including increasing targeted digital direct to consumer advertising;
●Expand coverage and reimbursement for Twirla in the United States from private and public third-party payors;
●Continue to expand access to Twirla through multiple business channels including third-party payor contracts, retail and specialty pharmacies, telemedicine, government contracting, and public health centers;
●Maintain and manage the supply chain for Twirla to support increased commercialization of Twirla across the United States and working through existing and future inventory prior to product becoming short-dated;
●Reduce our operating loss and continue to progress towards generating positive cash flows;
●Evaluate the advancement of our existing pipeline and its possible expansion through business development activities; and
●Complete and submit the final study report for a post-marketing commitment study and continue to implement our obligations for the post-marketing requirement study.

It should be noted that current public health threats could adversely affect our ongoing or planned business operations. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in federal, state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions, including travel restrictions, access restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, and stay at home orders. The most significant impacts to our business were encountered by sales representatives promoting Twirla in the field, as some offices limited opportunities for face-to-face interactions with healthcare providers. In many cases COVID-19 restrictions have recently eased, but re-implementation of such restrictions if necessary in the future may disrupt our business and/or could adversely affect our commercialization plans and results. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timeline presently planned could be materially and adversely impacted. It is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete effect will be on us. While to date we have been able to continue to execute our overall business plan, some of our business activities slowed and took longer to complete as we adjusted to the challenges of operating in a largely remote setting with our employees. While we have acclimated to a hybrid work model with our employees, another shut down necessitating work in a completely remote environment could result in delays to our business activities and commercialization plan. Overall, we recognize the challenges of commercializing a new product in a pandemic, will continue to closely monitor events as they develop and plan for alternative and mitigating measures that we can implement if needed.

Twirla
Twirla is our first and only approved product. Twirla received FDA approval on February 14, 2020 as a method of contraception for use in women of reproductive potential with a BMI < 30 kg/m2 for whom a combined hormonal contraceptive is appropriate. Based on the reduced efficacy seen with increasing BMI in a Phase 3 clinical trial, Twirla’s limitation of use instructs healthcare providers to consider Twirla’s reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI ≥ 25 to <30 kg/m2 before prescribing. Twirla is contraindicated in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 because compared to women 

5



with a lower BMI, women in this group had reduced effectiveness and may have a higher risk for VTEs. Twirla’s label also includes the class-wide boxed warning, contraindications, and warnings and precautions applicable to all combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs.
 Twirla is a prescription combined hormonal contraceptive patch that contains the active ingredients ethinyl estradiol, or EE, which is a synthetic estrogen, and levonorgestrel, or LNG, which is a type of progestin, both of which have an established history of efficacy and safety in currently marketed combination oral contraceptives. Twirla delivers 30 micrograms of EE per day, a dose of EE consistent with the dose delivered by many commonly prescribed oral contraceptives. Twirla is the only contraceptive patch that contains LNG, a widely prescribed progestin. Our Skinfusion technology allows Twirla to be the first approved patch capable of delivering a contraceptive dose of LNG across the skin. The patch is applied once weekly for three weeks, followed by a week without a patch. Twirla is packaged with three individually wrapped patches per carton to provide for one 28-day cycle of therapy.
Twirla’s approval is primarily based on safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 SECURE trial. The SECURE trial was a new approach to clinical trials, and was intentionally designed to include broad enrollment criteria and a patient population of women likely to use hormonal contraceptives. In this purposefully inclusive trial, efficacy and safety were evaluated in a diverse study population, one that is more representative of the demographics of women across the US likely to use hormonal contraception.
The SECURE trial was a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, 13-cycle trial that evaluated the safety, efficacy and tolerability of Twirla in 2,031 healthy women, aged 18 and over, at 102 experienced investigative sites across the United States. The trial was designed in consultation with the FDA, and incorporated a number of stringent trial design elements, including exclusion of treatment cycles not only for use of backup contraception but also for lack of sexual activity. SECURE had broad entry criteria, placed no limitations on body mass index, or BMI, or other demographic factors during enrollment, and enrolled a large and diverse population from the United States in order to allow for efficacy to be assessed across different groups. These entry criteria resulted in the inclusion of a substantial number of women with high BMIs, who have frequently been underrepresented in prior contraceptive studies. The efficacy measure for SECURE was the Pearl Index in an intent-to-treat population of subjects 35 years of age and under. The FDA also requested the inclusion of prespecified efficacy analyses related to BMI and body weight.
 As part of Twirla’s approval, and consistent with requirements for another recently approved CHC, the FDA is requiring us to conduct a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing study, or PMR, comparing the risks for VTE and ATE in new users of Twirla to new users of CHCs. The final study report for the Twirla post-marketing study is scheduled to be submitted to the FDA in November 2032, with interim safety data reporting to the FDA due in November 2026. We also agreed to an FDA-requested post-marketing commitment, or PMC, study to assess the residual drug content and strength of Twirla in a minimum of 25 women. The PMC study is similar to residual drug studies requested of patch developers in the FDA’s November 2019 draft guidance entitled Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems—Product Development and Quality Considerations. The PMC study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and we expect that the study report will be submitted to the FDA on schedule in June 2022. 
Contraceptive Landscape and Market Opportunity
U.S. Hormonal Contraceptive Market Background
Contraceptive methods, other than sterilization, can be divided into non-hormonal and hormonal alternatives. Examples of non-hormonal products available in the United States include the diaphragm, male condom, female condom, and non-hormonal intrauterine device, or IUD. Hormonal contraceptives containing both estrogen and a progestin are referred to as CHCs, and contraceptives containing only progestin are referred to as P-only. There are several categories of hormonal contraception products available in the United States, including:
●oral contraceptive;
●vaginal ring;

6



●transdermal patch;
●hormonal IUD;
●subcutaneous implant; and
●injectable.

The U.S. hormonal contraceptive market is a multi-billion-dollar market. Data from 2017 to 2019 from the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, indicate that approximately 28% of women aged 15 to 49 use some form of hormonal contraception, which amounts to approximately 20 million U.S. women. The CHC portion of the market, which includes pills, three transdermal patches, including Twirla, and two vaginal rings, generates significantly greater prescription volume and sales compared to the P-only portion of the market, consisting of hormonal IUDs, injectables, implants, and P-only pills.
The U.S. hormonal contraceptive market is a mature market, with many branded and generic products available. For the past 5 years, sales revenue in the CHC market has been essentially flat, at approximately $6 billion per year. Total prescription volume, or TRx, declined from 2017 to 2021 by 25%, from 83 million to 62 million; however the number of cycles dispensed (1 cycle = 1 month supply) declined by only 4% over the same time period, as the average TRx size (cycles/TRx) grew from 1.5 to 1.9 over the same time period. Therefore, the value of a TRx has grown significantly over the past 5 years, particularly for branded products, where the average revenue per TRx increased from $198.28 in 2017 to $305.86 in 2021. 
Despite the availability of generic contraceptives for over 30 years, branded products have maintained a significant, though declining, share of CHC sales, with 23% of sales in 2021. In the five years ended December 2021, the average annual price increase among the top branded products was 7.3%. The average price per cycle, referred to as the wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, for a single 28-day cycle of the top branded products was $141.17 in 2017 and rose to $175.73 by December 2021. The branded CHC transdermal patch (Ortho Evra) was discontinued in October 2014 and the branded generic CHC transdermal patches (Xulane and Zafemy) are both currently priced at $122.15 per cycle. Our current WAC price for Twirla is $174.77. The other non-oral form of CHC, the monthly vaginal ring, is currently priced at $162.63 per cycle for the branded version, Nuvaring, and $138.24, 140.52, and $148.32 for generic versions. We cannot predict how the manufacturers of branded or generic products will manage prices going forward.

The U.S. contraceptive population (defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as women aged 15-49) is currently approximately 75 million women and is estimated to grow to nearly 80 million by 2035.

Contraceptive Pills
Based on 2017 to 2019 data from the CDC, of women who choose to use a hormonal contraceptive, approximately 55% use a contraceptive pill, vaginal ring or patch, the majority of whom use the contraceptive pill. The remaining 45% of women using hormonal contraception are split between using injectables, implants, or IUDs. Based on this information, we believe that contraceptive pills are the most popular choice because:
●patients and physicians are familiar with pills;
●pills were the first to market and have been aggressively promoted for a long period of time;
●historically, pills have been a covered benefit with good reimbursement in private and public healthcare plans; and
●pills are a non-invasive option.

However, compliance remains a significant draw-back with pills. Published studies have shown that the average woman who uses oral contraceptives misses approximately two to four pills per month, which increases the potential for unintended pregnancies. We believe that a patch can offer greater convenience than a pill, as it does not require daily administration and, for certain women, could lead to greater compliance and ease of use.

Contraceptive Patch Market Experience
The Ortho Evra® contraceptive patch, or Evra, was introduced in early 2002 and was the first FDA-approved contraceptive patch. The initial approved labeling for Evra indicated that it delivered a daily EE dose of 20 micrograms. Evra had rapid uptake in the contraceptive market and achieved a 10% share of the CHC market by September 2003. Following FDA approval of Evra, users of Evra began to report thrombotic and thromboembolic events to the FDA. Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Evra, revised the Evra labeling in November 2005 to include information that EE exposure with Evra is 60% higher than that of an oral contraceptive containing EE of 35 micrograms, based on area under the curve, a commonly-used metric for measuring EE exposure in contraceptives. This information was ultimately included in an addition to the boxed warning that was unique to the Evra label. In 2020, the Xulane label was revised to reflect a contraindication in women with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 because of the reduced efficacy and increased potential risk for VTEs in this population. In making this revision, the information about increased estrogen exposure was removed from the boxed warning but remains in the warnings and precautions and pharmacokinetics sections of the label. The Evra market share declined rapidly following the 2005 labeling changes, from a peak share of 11% in 2005, to 4% by the end of 2006, to 1.4% by the end of 2013, where it stabilized, with a 1.5% share of the market based on combined prescriptions for Evra and its generic equivalent (Xulane®) in 2014. In more recent years, the Xulane share of the CHC market TRx has grown, from a 1.8% share in 2017 to a 2.5% share in 2021. Zafemy, a second generic of Ortho Evra launched in 2021, had a market share of 0.7% in December 2021. 
The FDA has maintained, in spite of the wording in the labeling for Evra, which has been discontinued, and its approved branded generic, that none of the epidemiologic studies provides a definitive answer regarding the relative risk of VTE with Evra compared to combined oral contraceptive use or whether the increased risk that some studies demonstrated is directly attributable to Evra. In spite of the labeling changes, and Johnson & Johnson ceasing promotion of Evra in 2007, the generic equivalent of Evra (Xulane) generated sales of $256 million in 2021. On February 26, 2021, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it had received approval by the FDA for Zafemy, a generic version of Ortho Evra. Zafemy generated sales of $85.4 million in 2021.
Twirla is the only transdermal contraceptive option currently available to women that delivers a low dose of estrogen. We believe that the rapid uptake and acceptance of Evra upon its introduction and its (and Xulane’s) continued sales over the past several years demonstrate a market opportunity for multiple choices in transdermal contraceptive patches.
Twirla Potential Market Share
Three of our market research studies have included an allocation exercise to estimate the potential uptake of Twirla and peak market share. In all of these studies, ObGyns and nurse practitioners, or NPs, indicated their allocation of contraceptive prescriptions before and after reviewing a product profile like Twirla that reflects the safety and efficacy results from our SECURE clinical trial. In the 2010 study, which was conducted prior to the implementation of the ACA, ObGyns estimated use of a product like Twirla in 17% of their CHC patients. A proprietary calibration model developed by the research firm was applied to the peak share estimate, to adjust for physician overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 9% of the CHC market. In the study completed in December 2016, ObGyns, NPs, and physicians assistants, or PAs, estimated use of Twirla in 22% of their CHC patients, which was also calibrated to adjust for overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 14% of the CHC market. This estimate was confirmed in our most recent study completed in September of 2019, in which ObGyns and NPs/PAs estimated use of Twirla in 20% of their CHC patients, calibrated to 14% of the CHC market.
We continue to evaluate the commercial opportunity for Twirla. We believe that the potential new CHC users who are within Twirla’s approved indication represent a significant population of women. Based on our market research, analysis of the current and expected future U.S. contraceptive market, and review of other product launches in the category, we estimate that Twirla can potentially achieve a peak market share of 5-8%. We believe that the ability of Twirla to achieve this potential peak market share will require a substantial level of investment in promotional activities supporting the marketing and sales of Twirla.

As we pursue the commercialization of Twirla, we will continue to analyze the contraceptive market and update our market research for Twirla.
Twirla Commercialization Strategy
Our top priority is the successful commercialization of Twirla. Promptly after approval by the FDA in February 2020, we began implementation of our plan to market Twirla. During 2021 we concentrated our marketing efforts on increasing both patient awareness and access through digital advertising to consumers in our target market and strategic partnering. We also focused on increasing patient access to Twirla across different channels, including specialty pharmacy, and telemedicine, as well as through eVoucher programs at the pharmacy level and by establishing relationships with GPOs, including Afaxys GPO. In 2022, we intend to continue implementation of our commercial strategy for Twirla with an emphasis on focused digital advertising and expanding market access through multiple business channels, including third-party payor contracts, retail and specialty pharmacies, telemedicine, and government contracts. We also plan to continue to engage with third-party payors and insurers to seek expanded access and re-imbursement coverage of Twirla.
Twirla Promotion Strategy
We have a limited number of sales and marketing employees and primarily rely on third-party agencies with experience in commercializing pharmaceutical products to advance the commercialization of Twirla. Our marketing efforts are initially focused on Obstetrician-gynecologists in the United States, and we plan to use a significant number of samples to gain patient trial and acceptance. We believe that we can continue to deploy a focused sales force effort targeting the ObGyn, NP and PA prescribers who are responsible for approximately 70% of branded CHC prescriptions. In areas of the country where it is not efficient to deploy a sales representative, and/or depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual promotion will be used to reach prescribers. We plan to complement these efforts by expanding the channels we utilize to drive awareness of Twirla and will focus on promotion with key prescribers and customer groups, including consumers and commercial managed care plans.
In 2022, we plan to use a branded digital campaign to create awareness of Twirla among consumers. We believe there are cost-effective means to reach our target demographic of females ages 18 to 34 years, who tend to engage in online activities to a high degree and are more likely to seek health information online and through social networks. Marketing tactics aimed at today’s female consumer need to be optimized for mobile technology because smartphones and text messaging are the preferred means of communication. We believe that a focused consumer promotion plan that uses digital media, social media advertising, video and other mass-market advertising vehicles will generate consumer awareness and demand for Twirla. 
Twirla Coverage and Reimbursement Strategy
After approval of Twirla by the FDA, we began meeting with formulary decision makers as appropriate to secure positions for Twirla that minimize access barriers for prescribers and patients, and since then we estimate that we have been able to achieve formulary access for approximately fifty-five to fifty-eight percent (55-58%) of the estimated covered lives by commercial third-party payors. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products. The United States government and other third-party payors are increasingly limiting both coverage and level of reimbursement for new drugs, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. In this challenging environment, we plan to continue our efforts to expand formulary access to Twirla through contracting strategies and engaging with formulary boards on the clinical profile of Twirla. We believe that it is important in this category for women to have equal access to all methods, dosing regimens and hormonal options so that they and their provider can select the choice that is the most appropriate to meet their lifestyle and family planning goals.
Our Pipeline: Twirla Line Extensions and Potential Product Candidates
Twirla is our first and only approved product, and, to date, substantially all of our resources have been committed to obtaining approval of Twirla and initiating our commercialization of Twirla. While seeking approval of Twirla and 

10



preparing for commercial launch, we paused all work on our pipeline. We have initiated a full evaluation of our pipeline to establish a plan to advance the development of Twirla line extensions and other potential product candidates.
Our potential product pipeline consists of two types of product candidates: a progestin-only (P-only) contraceptive patch and potential Twirla line extensions. These potential product candidates are designed to address market needs and offer additional non-daily contraceptive options. Though all product development activities have currently been put on hold, we expect that developing our P-only patch will be our first priority when we resume development activities.
Our primary potential product candidate is a progestin-only (P-only) contraceptive patch, or P-Patch, and is intended for use by women of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. The intended population for the P-Patch would be women who are unable or unwilling to take estrogen, including those who are breastfeeding or who are at greater risk of VTE, such as women who smoke, are over 35 years of age, or who are obese. Currently, the P-only market consists of pills and several non-oral options, including IUS/IUDs, implants, and injections. We believe there is a need for a P-only option in a convenient, non-daily, user-controlled method, especially as the population of women with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) increases in the United States. Additional formulation development work for progestin and dose selection is required, along with additional studies to determine the optimal formulation and dose to advance to Phase 3.
In addition to our P-Patch, we have the ability to develop potential Twirla line extensions. The hormonal contraceptive market has a long history of manufacturers successfully using line extensions to extend the lifecycle of a brand, often by gaining additional exclusivity periods for the product extension under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act and/or with additional patents. Our lifecycle strategy with Twirla may include introducing line extensions that will have exclusivity for some time period, either due to our intellectual property estate, or due to Hatch-Waxman exclusivity. These regimens are protected by patents issued to us in 2015 and include the following: 
●AG200-15 Extended Regimen (ER) is an 84-day extended cycle regimen utilizing our approved Twirla TDS product designed to allow a woman to have four (4) episodes of withdrawal bleeding per year. 
●AG200-15 SmP is a 28-day regimen designed to provide users with shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeds and potentially improve contraceptive efficacy. AG200-15 SmP may also provide benefit in patients with sensitivity to abrupt changes in hormone levels. AG200-15 SmP is designed to provide a simplified 28-day regimen through use of the same drug product as Twirla for the first three weeks of the cycle, and a smaller lower-dose patch, or SmP, in the fourth week, which will allow patients to continuously apply patches without interruption.

●AG200-15 ER SmP is a 91-day extended cycle regimen utilizing our approved Twirla TDS and the SmP that is designed to allow a woman to have four (4) shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeding episodes per year. By extending the length of the contraceptive cycle, AG200-15 ER SmP is designed to potentially minimize breakthrough bleeding and spotting, which are commonly reported events with patients using an extended regimen contraceptive product. 

We do not expect to be required to conduct preclinical toxicology studies for any of these potential product candidates. Based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our available capital resources and feedback from the FDA, we continue to review the clinical path and the budgetary requirements for each of our potential product candidates.
Competition
The industry for contraceptive products is characterized by intense competition and strong promotion of proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical device companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
We face competition from a variety of non-permanent birth control products. There are non-hormonal barrier methods, such as the contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, cervical cap or shield and condoms. Then, there are hormonal methods, which is the category for Twirla and our potential product candidates, such as oral contraceptives, injections, implants, hormonal IUDs and vaginal ring and transdermal contraceptive products.

The following table is the FDA Birth Control Chart, which outlines the 18 unique forms of birth control and compares the effectiveness of each method.

Although there are more than 200 CHC products currently available, including brands and generics, just 14 branded products make up approximately 40% of total market revenue. Our potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, and specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies. The branded products with established market presence include Nuvaring®, marketed by Merck, and Annovera®, marketed by Therapeutics MD, the Loestrin® franchise, marketed by Allergan (formerly known as Actavis), consisting of three oral contraceptives, Minastrin® 24, LoLoestrin® and Taytulla®, and Beyaz®, Yaz®, Yasmin® and Natazia® marketed by Bayer. Xulane, a branded generic to Ortho Evra, generated $256 million in sales for Mylan in 2021. On February 26, 2021, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it had received approval by the FDA for Zafemy, a second generic version of Ortho Evra. Zafemy had sales of $85.4 million in 2021. Additionally, several generics manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives, including Sandoz, Glenmark, Lupin, Amneal, Mylan, Aurobindo, and Xiromed. Based on the market experience of other non-oral CHC dosage forms, including Evra and Nuvaring, we believe there is a continuing demand for an innovative transdermal contraceptive patch that can provide convenience in a low-dose transdermal format.
There are other contraceptive products recently approved or in development that may compete with Twirla and our other potential product candidates. Phexxi®, a prescription non-hormonal vaginal gel approved for use as an on-demand contraceptive, was developed by Evofem and launched in August of 2020. Nextstellis™, a combined oral contraceptive containing drosperinone and a new form of estrogen, estetrol (E4), was developed by Mithra Pharmaceuticals and is licensed to Mayne Pharmaceuticals for marketing in the U.S. and Australia. Mayne fielded a new women’s health team in the U.S. and launched Nextstellis in June of 2021. The Population Council has a transdermal gel contraceptive and a vaginal ring contraceptive, both containing segesterone acetate (the same progestin contained in Annovera) and ethinyl estradiol in Phase 2 development. Bayer has an IUD containing both LNG and an NSAID (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory), to reduce pain upon insertion in Phase 2. Bayer also signed a license agreement in January of 2020 with Dare Bioscience for U.S. commercial rights to Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly contraceptive vaginal ring, which is in Phase 2 development. Allergan has a P-only patch for which they received a CRL from the FDA in 2013.
We are aware of only one other CHC transdermal patch, which is not approved in the U.S. Apleek was developed by Luye Pharma and Bayer, and it was approved in the United Kingdom in 2014. Luye acquired the global rights to Apleek from Bayer AG in August 2018. Apleek contains the active ingredients EE and gestodene, a third-generation progestin. There are no contraceptives containing gestodene approved in the U.S. We believe that if this product were to obtain FDA approval, the approved labeling is likely to contain the same language that products containing third generation progestins contain, which language states that these contraceptives have a two-fold increase in risk of VTE as compared with contraceptives containing second generation progestins.
Manufacturing
We do not own any manufacturing facilities, although we do own certain manufacturing equipment, and rely on Corium for all aspects of the manufacturing of Twirla. We, along with Corium, have made a significant investment in a proprietary process to manufacture Twirla. We believe we have developed a robust process to reliably manufacture Twirla on a commercial scale. We believe that the technical challenges and know-how involved in manufacturing, including proprietary chemistry, production to scale and use of custom equipment and reproducibility, present significant barriers to entry for other pharmaceutical companies who might potentially want to replicate our Skinfusion technology.

Strategic Agreements
Agreement with Corium
 In April 2020, we entered into a manufacturing and commercialization agreement with Corium, which we refer to as the Corium Agreement, and which replaced our previous development agreement. Pursuant to the Corium Agreement, Corium will manufacture and supply all of our product requirements for Twirla at certain specified rates. Under the terms of the Corium Agreement, Corium is to be the exclusive supplier of Twirla for ten years. The Corium Agreement includes a quarterly minimum purchase commitment and a fixed price per unit for two years from December 2020, the date of the first commercial batch purchase order invoice, depending on annual purchase volume. During 2021, we did not meet all of our minimum quantity purchases from Corium, and as a result, paid penalties as required by our agreement with Corium.
 The Corium Agreement terminates automatically after ten years, but may be terminated for any reason upon the written mutual agreement of both parties; provided, however, that the parties must confer in good faith regarding possible mutual termination. In the event of such termination, we may still effect purchase orders after the notice of termination is given and until the time any such termination becomes effective.
Agreement with Syneos Selling Solutions
 In April 2020, we entered into a project agreement with inVentiv Commercial Services, LLC, or inVentiv, a Syneos Health Group Company, which we refer to as the Syneos Agreement, under our Master Services Agreement with inVentiv. Pursuant to the Syneos Agreement, inVentiv, through its affiliate Syneos Selling Solutions, will provide a field force of sales representatives to provide certain detailing services, sales operation services, compliance services and training services with respect to Twirla to us in exchange for an up-front implementation fee and a fixed monthly fee.
 Effective February 1, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Syneos Agreement that extended the term until August 23, 2024. At that time, the Syneos Agreement will terminate automatically unless extended upon the mutual written agreement of both parties. We may terminate the Syneos Agreement for any reason upon timely written notice without incurring a termination fee. 
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for pharmaceutical products are made on a payor-by-payor basis. The principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines by the U.S. Government are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, coverage determinations are often a time-consuming and costly process that require companies to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of approved products to multiple stakeholders which may include Group Purchasing Organizations (GPO’s), Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM’s), individual payer health plans, as well as government payors and federal purchasers including CMS, the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense and state Medicaid managed and Fee For Service plans, with no assurance on the level of coverage or that adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products.
Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws, enforcement policies or administrative determinations with respect to the importation of drugs into the United States from other countries where they may be sold at lower prices.
In the United States, third-party payors include federal health care programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Veterans Health Administration programs; managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Several of the U.S. federal health care programs require that drug manufacturers extend discounts or pay rebates to certain programs in order for their products to be covered and reimbursed. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered outpatient drugs to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the federal government as a condition for coverage of the manufacturer’s covered 

14



outpatient drug(s) by state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is based on a statutory formula and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with states’ establishment of preferred drug lists. A further requirement for Medicaid coverage is that the manufacturer enter into a Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement with the Secretary for Veterans Affairs to extend discounted pricing to the VA, DOD and other agencies.
Similarly, in order for a covered outpatient drug to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts on the covered outpatient drug to entities that are enrolled and participating in the 340B drug pricing program, which is a federal program that requires manufacturers to provide discounts to certain statutorily-defined safety-net providers. The 340B discount for each product is calculated based on certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics that manufacturers are required to report to CMS.
There has been recent negative publicity and increasing legislative and public scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S. Moreover, U.S. government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate drug prices and reimbursement. These dynamics may give rise to heightened attention and potential negative reactions to pricing decisions for Twirla and products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability.
The United States government and other third-party payors are increasingly limiting both coverage and level of reimbursement for new drugs, in addition to questioning their safety, efficacy and clinical value. Consolidation among managed care entities has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payors increasingly use closed formularies, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Third-party payors have traditionally used differential co-pays to attempt to drive patients to use either generic products or products for which they have a contract with the manufacturer. Typically, a third-party payor’s formulary is organized into between three and six tiers. Each tier is then associated with a set range of co-pay amounts or a percent of the drug costs, with products in the lower tiers having a lower co-pay. 
Reimbursement for female contraceptive products was changed by the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and further updated on March 30,2010 to become the Affordable Care Act (ACA). On January 20, 2012, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a final rule on health insurance coverage that provided for no cost sharing for FDA-approved contraceptives and contraceptive services for women of reproductive age if prescribed by health care providers, as part of women's preventive health services guidelines adopted by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the ACA. The final rule applied to all new health insurance plans in all states beginning August 1, 2012.
On January 10th, 2022, the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services and the Treasury (The Departments) released a set of “Frequently Asked Questions” (“2022 FAQ”) which affirmed that under the ACA’s women’s preventives services, plans cannot limit their coverage of contraceptives. The Departments issued the 2022 FAQ in response to complaints and public reports of potential violations of the contraceptive coverage requirement. The 2022 FAQ makes clear that all FDA-approved cleared, or granted contraceptive products that are determined by an individual’s medical provider to be medically appropriate for such individual must be covered without-cost sharing, whether or not specifically identified in the current FDA Birth Control Guide. Outlined under Coverage of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Contraceptives, the 2022 FAQ notes that on February 20, 2013, The Departments issued an FAQ stating that the HRSA Guidelines must ensure women's access to the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods including, but not limited to, barrier methods, hormonal methods, and implanted devices, as well as patient education and counseling, as prescribed by a health care provider. The FAQ further clarified that plans and issuers may use reasonable medical management techniques to control costs and promote efficient delivery of care, such as covering a generic drug without cost sharing and imposing cost sharing for equivalent branded drugs. However, in these instances, the FAQ stated that a plan or issuer must accommodate any individual for whom a particular drug (generic or brand name) would be medically inappropriate, as determined by the individual’s health care provider, by having a mechanism for waiving the otherwise applicable cost sharing for the brand or non-preferred brand version.

15



Previously, on May 11, 2015, The Departments issued an FAQ (“2015 FAQ”) clarifying that plans and issuers must cover without cost sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the methods (currently 18) identified for women by the FDA. The FAQ further clarified that to the extent plans and issuers use reasonable medical management techniques within a specified method of contraception, plans and issuers must have an easily accessible, transparent, and sufficiently expedient exceptions process that is not unduly burdensome on the individual or provider (or other individual acting as a patient's authorized representative, including a provider) to ensure coverage without cost sharing of any service or FDA-approved item within the specified method of contraception. The FAQ also stated that if an individual’s attending provider recommends a particular service or FDA-approved item based on a determination of medical necessity with respect to that individual, the plan or issuer must cover that service or item without cost sharing. The FAQ makes clear that a plan or issuer must defer to the determination of the attending provider. Medical necessity may include considerations such as severity of side effects, differences in permanence and reversibility of contraceptives, and ability to adhere to the appropriate use of the item or service, as determined by the attending provider.
The 2022 FAQ noted that plans and issuers subject to these requirements are reminded of their responsibility to fully comply with the requirements under PHS Act section 2713 and the HRSA Guidelines, as interpreted in The Departments’ implementing regulations and guidance, including the requirement that, if an individual and their attending provider determine that a particular service or FDA-approved, cleared or granted contraceptive product is medically appropriate for the individual (whether or not the item or service is identified in the current FDA Birth Control Guide), the plan or issuer must cover that service or product without cost sharing.
In addition, on January 20, 2017, the Trump administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. The Biden administration revoked the Trump administration Executive Order on January 28, 2021. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim final rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. In July 2020, the Supreme Court reversed lower court injunctions applicable to these rules, effectively permitting implementation. The Biden administration has indicated it may elect to exercise its authorities under the ACA differently from the previous administration. In another FAQ issued on August 16, 2021, The Departments noted they are considering how best to address these provisions in light of recent litigation. The Departments indicated they intend to initiate rulemaking within 6 months to amend the 2018 final regulations and obtaining public input will be included as part of The Departments’ rulemaking process. However, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business.
Before the ACA was passed, many states had enacted contraceptive equity laws that required plans to treat contraceptives in the same way they covered other services. In addition, since the ACA was passed, a number of states have enacted laws that basically codify in state legislation the ACA benefit rules (requiring all plans regulated by the state to cover, without cost-sharing, each of the 18 FDA-approved contraceptive methods and in some cases have gone further and required coverage of all FDA approved contraceptives). Federal law applies to all plans while state law applies to only individual plans and fully-insured group plans. Currently, 30 states and the District of Columbia require insurance plans to cover contraceptives, with a wide range of coverage and cost-sharing requirements, and exemptions among these mandates. We continue to monitor healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation as well as state contraceptive legislation.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

16



FDA Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. FDA has also issued many guidance documents which outline its interpretation of its governing laws and regulations. Over the last year, the number of guidance documents has increased, as FDA issued a number of guidances, which are continually evolving, to assist companies navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of trials, issuance of Warning, Untitled, or Cyber Letters, requests for product recalls, product seizures or detention, operating restrictions such as the total or partial suspension or restriction of production, marketing or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment, refusal to allow the import or export of product, adverse publicity, modification of promotional materials or labeling, refusals of government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, imprisonment, consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements, or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
●Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
●Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
●Approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
●Performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with Current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
●Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
●Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
●Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with FDA requirements for product manufacturing and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as the potential for completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine cGCP compliance; and
●FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, proposed clinical protocols, and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND, unless the sponsor is relying on prior FDA findings of safety or efficacy of the drug product, in which case, some of the above information may be omitted. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An 

17



IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB for each clinical trial site participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered through controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. In addition to the above traditional kinds of data required for the approval of an NDA, the 21st Century Cures Act provides for FDA acceptance of additional kinds of data such as s patient experience data, real world evidence for already approved products, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to FDA product manufacturing requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Failure to submit the required information to ClinicalTrials.gov 

18



can result in monetary penalties. Marketing application applicants must also report certain investigator financial interests to the FDA.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
U.S. Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Application resubmissions by the same applicant do not require a new application fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. The FDA’s standard review goal is to act on 90% of all Non-New Molecular Entity applications within ten months of FDA receipt of the application. These time periods may be extended by the FDA should an applicant submit new information to the agency during the course of the FDA’s review of the marketing application. The time period is also only a goal and may not be met by the FDA. Additionally, this review period may change as the PDUFA statute must be reauthorized by Congress by September 2022.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all original NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be submitted again with the additional information and is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held, as well as the manufacturing processes and controls, meet standards designed to ensure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer a marketing application to an external advisory committee for questions pertaining to issues such as clinical trial design, safety and efficacy, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations and considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with the FDA’s requirements for product manufacturing and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. Also, as part of its regulatory review, the FDA verifies the data contained in the NDA.

19



The testing and approval process for a drug product requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of a marketing application on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or a CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the drug product and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application.If an application receives a CRL, the applicant may resubmit the application, addressing all of the FDA-cited deficiencies, withdraw the application, or request the opportunity for a hearing. Resubmitted applications may also be subject to FDA inspection of clinical and manufacturing sites, as well as review by FDA advisory committees. Following its review of a resubmitted NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter or another CRL.
Even if an applicant resubmits with the required additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product candidate, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate and require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Moreover, the FDA may require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess certain aspects of a drug’s safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. A REMS could materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, submission of a supplemental application, and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.
Hatch-Waxman Act
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of an approved drug product through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of 

20



time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. In an effort to clarify which patents must be listed in the Orange Book, in January 2021, Congress passed the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2020, which largely codifies FDA’s existing practices into the FDCA. 
Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that: (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify a listed method-of-use patent. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within a specified timeframe. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the Paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the Paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a Paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against the FDA making an ANDA and 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for the condition of the new drug’s approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

Our NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section 505(b)(2), and we expect that some of our other drug candidates will utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even though several of our drug products utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish the safety and efficacy of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing. All approved products, both innovator and generic, are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book.
Recently, Congress, the executive branch, and FDA have taken certain measures to increase drug competition and thus, decrease drug prices. By example, the measures have been proposed and implemented to facilitate drug importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act also required sponsors of NDA approved products to provide sufficient quantities of drug product on commercially reasonable market based terms to entities developing generic and similar drug products. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorneys’ fees and costs of the civil action. This bill also included provisions on shared and individual REMS for generic drug products.
Combination Drug/Device Regulation
Twirla and our potential product candidates are considered to be drug-device combination products by the FDA. While our potential product candidates, as a whole, are subject to the NDA approval process, drug-device combination products require compliance with additional FDA regulations. For instance, drug-device combination products must comply with the drug cGMPs, as well as some of the device Quality System Regulations, or QSRs. Recently, in January 2022, FDA issued its final guidance on premarket approval pathways for combination products to help facilitate development of safe and effective combination products. Specifically, in the guidance, FDA defines combination products and discusses how center assignments are determined; discusses the interaction between FDA and sponsors; and includes recommendations for discerning the appropriate premarket pathway for a combination product. These dual requirements for combination products will require additional effort, FDA reporting, and monetary expenditure to ensure that Twirla and our potential product candidates comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to manufacturing recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance to assess safety and efficacy after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing, annual prescription drug program user fee requirements for any approved products. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the FDA. 
Drug sponsors and manufacturers are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with FDA and state requirements for product manufacturing and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from FDA requirements for product manufacturing and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain FDA product manufacturing compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in 

22



mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
●Restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or requests for product recalls;
●Fines, or Untitled, Cyber or Warning Letters or holds on or termination of post-approval clinical trials;
●Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
●Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
●Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties including disgorgement, restitution, fines and imprisonment;
●Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
●Debarment;
●Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; or
●The FDA or other regulatory authorities may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies and third parties engaged on their behalf to promote their drug products are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside the approved label, a practice known as off-label promotion. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment and refusal of government contracts.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and reporting regarding drug samples. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label drug product with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is also required to be done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Other persons and entities within the drug supply chain are also subject to Drug Quality and Security Act requirements.

23



FDA’s requirements with respect to drug manufacturing, marketing and distribution are continually evolving. FDA and Congress may pass new laws, regulations, and policies, as was done in March 2020 with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. The CARES Act included various provisions regarding FDA drug shortage reporting requirements, as well as provisions regarding supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy and domestic manufacturing. As part of the CARES Act implementation, the FDA recently issued a guidance on the reporting of the volume of drugs produced, which reporting will require additional administrative efforts by drug manufacturers. This and any future changes in law may require that we change our internal processes and procedures to ensure continued compliance.
U.S. Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among other things, anti-kickback, physician payment transparency, drug price transparency, and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes was also amended by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA established that a claim for reimbursement involving items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others,on the other. The Beneficiary Inducement Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes similar restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and federal healthcare program beneficiaries. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce or reward prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General, or OIG, published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute regulatory safe harbors. Under the final rule, OIG removed safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for rebates paid from drug manufacturers to Medicare Part D prescription drug plan sponsors or their pharmacy benefit managers and added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. Currently, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2026. Recent legislative proposals provided for a permanent prohibition on implementation of the rule.
Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer and its products from participation in federal healthcare programs, debarment from federal government procurement and non-procurement programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A 

24



claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Claims under the federal civil False Claims Act may be initiated by whistleblowers, who receive substantial financial incentives to come forward, through qui tam actions, and pursued, even if the government declines to intervene. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the whistleblower will share in the proceeds from any damages, penalties or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may pursue the case alone. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice or pharmacy claim for reimbursement, which can aggregate into tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. For these reasons, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers have increased significantly in volume and breadth in recent years, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, including for as much as $3.0 billion. Intent to deceive and actual knowledge is not necessary to establish civil liability, which may be predicated on reckless disregard for or deliberate ignorance of the truth. The federal government continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in investigations against pharmaceutical and health care companies. These investigations have involved, for example, allegations of improper financial relationships with referral sources, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product, as well as the promotion of products for unapproved uses and reporting false pricing information. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a violation of the civil False Claims Act. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotional activities, including off-label promotion of uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, cGMP violations, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. The criminal federal False Claims Act imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false fictitious or fraudulent. Conviction or civil judgment for violation of the False Claims Act can also result in debarment from federal government procurement and non-procurement programs and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
The ACA authorized the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufactures participating in the 340B program for failure to charge the statutory ceiling price, and required HHS to promulgate regulations establishing the standards for implementing this Civil Monetary Penalty, or CMP, authority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’, or CMS, final CMP rule went into effect January 1, 2019. 
The ACA included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to federal healthcare programs to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are “identified” (the “Overpayment Statute”), after which the recipient of the overpayment incurs federal civil False Claims Act liability. The law prohibits a recipient of a payment from the government from keeping an overpayment when the government mistakenly pays more than the amount to which the recipient is entitled even if the overpayment is not caused by any conduct of the recipient. In 2014 and 2016, the CMS released regulatory guidance (in the form of final rules) to Medicare providers, suppliers and managed care and prescription drug plans regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. Although these Medicare providers, suppliers and plans have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance regarding how to comply with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding monitoring and prosecuting suspected violations. These final rules are not directly applicable to manufacturers, except if a manufacturer is a direct recipient of payment by an agency such as a research grant but may impact their customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers, suppliers, and plans.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services 

25



relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payor.
In addition, we may be subject to healthcare data privacy and security regulations promulgated by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and electronic transmission of protected health information. HIPAA security standards and certain privacy standards directly apply to business associates, defined as persons or organizations, other than members of the covered entity’s workforce, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. In addition, other federal and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), may regulate the privacy and security of personal information that we maintain, particularly in instances where HIPAA and state medical privacy laws do not apply. Further, a new California privacy law amending the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023. Virginia and Colorado have also enacted comprehensive consumer state privacy laws that will become effective in 2023. Other federal and state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of prescription drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, report annually to the CMS information related to certain payments or other “transfers of value” made or distributed to or at the request of covered recipients, namely US-licensed physicians (defined to include doctors of medicine or osteopathy, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives and US teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests in an applicable drug manufacturer held by physicians and their immediate family. Payments made to physicians, other principal investigators, and certain research institutions for research, including clinical trials, are included within the ambit of this law. Disclosure of such information is made on a publicly available website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties, with increased penalties for “knowing failures,” for each payment, transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not timely and accurately reported in an annual submission.
There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws and laws in local jurisdictions that regulate price increases, require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and price increases, prohibit, restrict and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities, and require registration of and impose training requirements on sales representatives. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required in order to comply with such laws. The laws in some states also require pharmaceutical companies to establish and implement compliance programs that are consistent with voluntary industry guidelines and guidance published by the HHS-OIG. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers’ use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to a variety of penalties, depending upon the law found to have been violated, potentially including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, non-prosecution agreements, refusal of government contracts, debarment from federal government procurement and non-procurement programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Notification Obligations and Potential Liability Around Data Security Incidents, Including Cyberattacks
If personal or other sensitive information about patients or employees is disclosed in an unauthorized manner, or if we or our service providers are subject to real or perceived cyberattacks, ransomware, data breaches, or other security incidents or compromises, or disruption of information technology systems or software, our customers may curtail use of our platform, we may be exposed to liability, our reputation may suffer and our operations may be materially harmed and disrupted.
We, and third parties acting on our behalf, receive, collect, access, generate, store, disclose, share, make accessible, protect, secure, transmit, transfer, dispose of, use, store and otherwise process (collectively, “Process” or “Processing”) personal, confidential and proprietary information. The information technology networks and systems owned, operated, controlled or used by us or our service providers to Process information, including personal and other sensitive information, and to perform other business operations may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, software or hardware vulnerabilities, data breaches, ransomware attacks, security incidents, supply-side attacks, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, natural disasters, hardware failures, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, user malfeasance, computer viruses, unauthorized access, phishing or social engineering attacks, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other real or perceived cyberattacks or catastrophic events. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, loss or corruption of data, or unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information or other sensitive information. Cyberattacks could also result in the theft of, or unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of, our intellectual property. We utilize security tools and controls and we rely on our service providers to use sufficient security measures, including encryption and authentication technology, in an effort to protect personal and other sensitive information. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability, or the failure or inability of our vendors, to adequately protect personal information and there can be no assurance that we or our vendors will not suffer a data compromise, that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information or other data, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely fashion. 
Security incidents such as ransomware attacks, including those involving organized criminal threat actors, nation-states and nation-state supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe. We, and our service providers, have been subject to cyber, phishing and social engineering attacks and other security incidents in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not known until launched against us or our service providers. We and our third-party vendors may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyberattacks or our security measures, or those of our service providers, could fail or may be insufficient, resulting in security breaches, ransomware attacks, significant interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations, and/or the unauthorized disclosure, modification, misuse, unavailability, destruction or loss of personal or other sensitive information. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees, our service providers or their personnel or other parties. 
If we or our service providers experience, or are believed to have experienced, a security breach or other security incident or compromise (or if there is a perception that we or a service provider has experienced such an event), it may result in: government enforcement actions, including by the Department of Health and Human Services, that could include investigations, fines, penalties, audits and inspections; class actions or other private litigation that could include penalties and injunctions, including in the form of a large settlement; increased regulatory scrutiny; additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; loss of income; significant extra expenses to restore data or systems or to otherwise remediate or mitigate the issue (including costs for credit monitoring, notification and other related costs); diversions of management’s time and attention; temporary or permanent bans on all or some Processing of personal information; or orders to destroy, not use or to limit the Processing of personal information. Security incidents could also result in contractual breaches, indemnity obligations, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, and financial loss. 

27



Security incidents and vulnerabilities may cause some of our customers to cease doing business with us and our failure, or perceived failure, to meet expectations or legal obligations with regard to the security, integrity, availability and confidentiality of our systems and the Processing of data could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers, attract new customers and grow our business. Applicable data protection laws, privacy policies and data protection obligations (including contractual obligations) may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of a security incident, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and credit reporting agencies, and may also require us to provide other remedies, such as credit monitoring. Such notifications and other remedies are costly, and the notifications or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to material adverse impacts, including without limitation, negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in our services or security measures or breach of contract claims. Furthermore, actual or perceived security breaches or attacks on our systems or those of our service providers may cause us to incur increasing operational costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. 
There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability or other risk-mitigation provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages if we fail to comply with applicable data protection laws, privacy policies or data protection obligations (including contractual obligations) related to information security or security incidents. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from, or to adequately mitigate, liabilities or damages with respect to claims, costs, expenses, litigation, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, regulatory actions or material adverse impacts arising out of our privacy and security practices, Processing of data or security incidents we may experience, or that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
Additionally, any material disruption of our systems, or the systems of our service providers, could disrupt our ability to track, record and analyze the products that we sell and could negatively impact our operations. If our information technology systems suffer damage, disruption or shutdown and we do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. Due to the criticality of our sites to our business and operations, we are vulnerable to website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure, or a failure on the part of one of our vendors, to successfully respond to these risks could reduce sales and damage our reputation.
Coverage and Reimbursement Generally
The commercial success of Twirla and our other potential product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate coverage of and reimbursement levels for our potential product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United States, the E.U. and other potentially significant markets for our potential product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the E.U. will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our potential product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance organizations, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors.

28



Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting access to and reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Certain third-party payors routinely impose additional requirements before approving reimbursement of a prescription, including prior authorization and the requirement to try another therapy first. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our potential product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development for a product candidate. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our potential product candidates, exclusion of our potential product candidates from coverage or the requirement for payment of increased manufacturer rebates on units dispensed. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our potential product candidates in whole or in part.
Healthcare Reform
Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government healthcare programs may result in lower reimbursement for our potential product candidates or exclusion of our potential product candidates from coverage. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell Twirla and our potential product candidates, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
Specifically, there have been recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, penalize companies that do not agree to cap prices paid for certain drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, which among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” or AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. More recently, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, effective October 1, 2019, to exclude prices paid by secondary manufacturers for an authorized generic drug from the NDA holder’s AMP for the brand, thereby increasing the rebate amount and the 340B price for the brand. This was implemented by CMS in a final rule issued December 31, 2020. The rule also expanded the definition of products identified as “line extensions” and, in certain circumstances, required inclusion of patient copay assistance in Medicaid best price (effective January 1, 2023), thereby potentially increasing Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for such drugs. 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017 but deferred, also recently went into effect. On November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded, but similar programs have been described in recent legislative proposals. These and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.

29



Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. The law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
In addition, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. While President Biden previously signed legislation temporarily to eliminate this reduction through the end of 2021, recent legislation will restart the reductions, which will thereafter remain in effect through 2031 unless additional congressional action is taken. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our potential product candidates if they are approved.
Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. The FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance regarding the importation of drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. Implementation of this rule has been delayed to January 1, 2026, and recent legislative initiatives have proposed a permanent prohibition on implementation of the rule. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits various categories of entities – including those which are “issuers” of secruities on a US based exchange – and individuals from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates those companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to: 1) maintain books and records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and 2) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to assure management’s control, authority, and responsibility over the company’s assets. Activities that violate either the anti-bribery or accounting provisions of the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight and debarment from government contracts.

Foreign Regulation
We currently have no plans to seek approval for Twirla outside of the United States. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
​
Research and Development
Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $6.2 million, $13.5 million, and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2022, we expect to continue to incur research and development expenses as we conduct our post marketing obligations to the FDA.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our Skinfusion® technology, its methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, our patents and patent applications are directed to our Skinfusion technology or aspects thereof including certain transdermal delivery systems having an active adhesive matrix and methods of using such transdermal delivery systems for controlling fertility. We also rely on manufacturing trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain new patents and maintain existing patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our potential product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our potential product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to novel and nonobvious transdermal contraceptive products. The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, in our potential product candidates are generic and therefore our patents do not include claims directed solely to the API. We anticipate seeking additional patent protection in the United States and internationally for additional transdermal delivery systems and their methods of use.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent’s scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our potential product candidates will remain protected by enforceable and valid patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether

the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions generally are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to patent rights in the inventions covered in our issued patents and pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge proceedings in the USPTO or foreign patent offices such as oppositions, reexamination, inter-partes review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
More specifically, Twirla® is a transdermal contraceptive hormone delivery system. The system is a patch for application to the skin and contains two API, the hormones LNG, which is a synthetic progestin, and EE, a synthetic estrogen. The API are formulated with a combination of skin penetration enhancers, which promote penetration through the dermis and into the bloodstream, such that effective blood levels of the active agents are achieved to suppress ovulation and thereby prevent pregnancy.
In our Twirla product candidate line the active adhesive system consists of the active ingredients in a polyacrylate adhesive polymer matrix comprising the permeation enhancers dimethylsulfoxide, ethyl lactate, capric acid and lauryl lactate. The active blend is coated onto a release liner, and a backing layer is added on top of the active blend. The peripheral adhesive system, also called the overlay, comprising three layers is added onto the backing layer. The overlay comprises a polyisobutylene adhesive layer, an acrylic adhesive layer, and an overlay covering. The overlay covering is a commercially available silk-like polyester fabric. The adhesive components of the overlay, in addition to their adhesive function, create an in situ seal with the disposable release liner, trapping evaporable solvents in the active blend, thereby extending the usable shelf life of the product candidate and contributing to the comfort and effectiveness of the transdermal system during use. Prior to use of any of our potential product candidates, the release liner is removed by the user and discarded. The patch is then applied to the skin.
Eight U.S. patents, issuing from two patent families, are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. These patents include claims directed to transdermal delivery systems having an active adhesive matrix and claims directed to methods of controlling fertility by applying such transdermal delivery systems, and in all cases including a skin permeation enhancer. One of our eight issued U.S. patents expired November 22, 2020. Four more expired March 14, 2021. Two will expire July 10, 2028. The eighth will expire August 26, 2028.
Expired U.S. Patent Nos. 7,045,145, 7,384,650, 8,221,784, 8,221,785 and 8,883,196 were directed to the adhesive matrix of the transdermal delivery system used in Twirla to the dried final product formulation used in Twirla and to methods of administration. Foreign counterparts of certain of these patents have been granted and remain in force in China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, and Mexico. 
U.S. Patent Nos. 8,246,978, 8,747,888, and 9,050,348 are directed to structural features of the transdermal delivery system used in Twirla patch design for transdermal delivery of hormones or of other drugs. As such, these patents protect a platform technology for delivery of LNG, EE, other hormones, and other drugs. These patents expire in July and August 2028. Foreign counterparts have been granted in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Eurasia, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand and Japan.
U.S. Patent Nos. 9,198,876, 9,192,614, 9,198,919, 9,198,920, 9,775,847 and 9,782,419 and related patents and patent applications are directed to various novel dosing regimens, each of which employs transdermal delivery of contraceptive doses of EE and LNG during a “treatment interval” and transdermal delivery of low dose EE and low dose LNG during a “withdrawal interval”. Foreign counterparts are granted in Europe and Canada. We expect these patents will be relevant to two of the products in our pipeline, AG200-SP and AG200-ER, as well as other new potential regimens. These patents expire in October 2029.

We have patent applications pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions directed to novel formulations and methods designed to improve efficacy and modulate side effects of administration, as well as to provide personalized dosing based on body weight or BMI. We also have a pending United States patent application directed to packaging for transdermal systems containing certain skin permeation enhancers.
Regulatory Exclusivity
Our NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Even though Twirla utilizes API that were previously approved in the United States, Twirla utilizes LNG in a new dosage form, specifically a transdermal patch, and we provided new clinical data essential to approval in our NDA to establish the safety and efficacy of Twirla. Therefore, we received three years of U.S. marketing exclusivity for Twirla under the Hatch Waxman Act. The exclusivity prohibits the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the conditions of the Twirla approval. We will consider whether we are going to pursue patent term restoration, however, we do not expect to receive patent term restoration because, as explained above, Twirla is not the first approval of the API.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had 30 full time employees, including six in research and development and nineteen in selling, general and administrative roles. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
