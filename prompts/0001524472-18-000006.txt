Company History and Certain Relationships
On October 31, 2011 (the "Distribution Date"), ITT completed the Spin-off (the “Spin-off”) of Xylem, formerly ITT’s water equipment and services businesses. The Spin-off was completed pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2011 (the “Distribution Agreement”), among ITT (now ITT LLC), Exelis Inc., acquired by Harris Inc. on May 29, 2015, (“Exelis”) and Xylem.
On October 31, 2016, Xylem Inc. completed the acquisition of all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Sensus Worldwide Limited (other than Sensus Industries) (“Sensus”), pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of August 15, 2016, and the first Amendment to the Share Purchase Agreement dated as of October 31, 2016 (together, the “Purchase Agreement”). The aggregate consideration paid for the acquisition was approximately $$1,766 million ($1,710 million net of cash acquired).
Our Industry
Our planet faces serious water challenges. Less than 1% of the total water available on earth is fresh water, and these supplies are under threat due to factors such as the draining of aquifers, increased pollution and the effects of climate change. Demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth, industrial expansion, and increased agricultural development, with consumption estimated to double every 20 years. By 2025, more than 30% of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply. Even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply, existing infrastructure for water supply is aging and inadequately funded. In the United States, deteriorating pipe systems, theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of water being lost between the treatment plant and the end customer. This problem of "non-revenue" water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally, especially in developing markets where non-revenue water can represent 15% to 60% or more of net water produced. These and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry. We estimate the total addressable market size to be approximately $550 billion. 
We compete in areas that are pivotal to improving water productivity, water quality and resilience. Water productivity refers to the more efficient delivery and use of clean water. Water quality refers to the efficient and effective management of wastewater. Resilience refers to the management of water-related risks and the resilience of water infrastructure. Our customers often face all three of these challenges, ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks (which require increases in “water productivity”); energy-intensive or unreliable wastewater management systems (which require increases in “water quality”); or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts (which require increases in “resilience”). Additionally, through the 2016 acquisition of Sensus, we also provide solutions to enhance efficiency, improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the electric, gas, and lighting sectors. Delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the Company. We estimate our total served market size to be approximately $54 billion. 
The Global Water Industry Value Chain
The water industry value chain includes Equipment and Services companies, like Xylem, which address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base. This customer base includes utilities that supply water through an infrastructure network, and engineering, procurement and construction or (EPC) firms, which work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks, as depicted below. Utilities and EPC customers are looking for technology and application expertise from their Equipment and Services providers to address trends such as rising pollution, stricter regulations, and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge. In addition to utilities and EPC customers, Equipment and Service providers also provide distinct technologies to a wide array of entities, including farms, mines, power plants, industrial facilities and residential and commercial customers seeking to address similar trends.

Water Infrastructure
Our Water Infrastructure segment supports the process that collects water from a source, treats it and distributes it to users, and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications: Transport and Treatment. The Transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services, which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from a riverbed, construction or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging public utility infrastructure, as well as emergency water removal during severe weather events.
The customer base consists of two primary end markets: water utility and industrial. The water utility market includes public, private and public-private entities that support water and wastewater networks. The industrial market includes customers who require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations.
Water Infrastructure provides the majority of its sales through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities. Both water utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications. Several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise: (i) the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply, (ii) increasing environmental regulations, (iii) the need to increase system efficiencies to optimize energy costs, (iv) the retirement of a largely aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically replaced at utilities and other end-user customers, and (v) the build-out of water infrastructure in the emerging markets. We estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately $17 billion. 
Given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry, the Water Infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses. We differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product performance, reliability 
and innovation, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life-cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels and price. In the sale or rental of products and provision of services, we benefit from our large installed base, which requires maintenance, repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. Timeliness of delivery, quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for after-market products and services as well as equipment rentals. In geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response, customers have historically relied on us, rather than our competitors, for after-market products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions. Our key competitors within the Water Infrastructure segment include KSB Inc., Sulzer Ltd., Evoqua Water Technologies, United Rentals and Danaher Corporation.
Applied Water
Applied Water encompasses the uses of water and serves a diverse set of end markets including: residential, commercial, and industrial. Residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market, while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings, retail stores, institutional buildings, restaurants, schools, hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market. The industrial market includes OEMs, exploration and production firms, and developers and managers of industrial facilities, such as electrical power generators, chemical manufacturers, machine shops, clothing manufacturers, beverage dispensing and food processing firms, and car washes.
In the Applied Water segment, end markets vary widely and, as a result, specialized distribution partners are often preferred. As such, the Applied Water segment provides the majority of its sales through strong indirect channels with the remaining sales going through our global direct sales channels. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve, and we provide incentives to distributors, such as specialized loyalty and training programs.
We estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately $19 billion. Population growth, urbanization and regulatory requirements are macro growth drivers of these markets, driving the need for housing, food, community services and retail goods within growing city centers. 
Competition in the Applied Water segment focuses on brand equity, application expertise, product delivery and performance, quality, and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, coupled with world-class application expertise. We believe our distribution through well-established channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position. Our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has enabled us to compete effectively, to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets. Our key competitors within the Applied Water segment include Grundfos, Wilo SE, Pentair Ltd. and Franklin Electric Co., Inc.
Measurement & Control Solutions
Measurement & Control Solutions develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources. The segment delivers communications, smart metering, measurement and control technologies and services that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. We also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure water quality, flow and level in wastewater, surface water and coastal environments. Additionally, we sell software and services including cloud-based analytics, remote monitoring and data management, leak detection and pressure monitoring solutions, as well as smart lighting products and solutions that improve efficiency and public safety efforts across communities.
At the heart of our leading technologies is automation and information. Communications networks automate and optimize meter reading, monitor flow rates and detect and enable rapid response to unsafe conditions. In short, they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks. At the center of our offering is the FlexNet communication network, which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential services. This two-way communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols, frequently on FCC licensed spectrum that enable reliable, resilient and secure transmissions. These technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor infrastructure, prioritize and manage maintenance and use data to optimize all aspects of their networks. 
The majority of our sales in the U.S. is conducted through strong, long-standing relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for water, gas and electric markets. Internationally, direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels; however, some distribution channels are used in 
more developed markets. A more direct sales approach, with key account management, is employed for large utilities and government programs.
We estimate our served market size in this sector to be approximately $18 billion. Macro growth drivers include increasing regulation and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation. Water scarcity and conservation, as well as the need to prevent revenue loss (via inaccurate meter readings, leaks or theft) are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies. 
Our Sensus-branded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector, the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry. We set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network, new product development and service offerings that are driving tangible savings of non-revenue water through improved meter accuracy, reduced theft and identification of leaks. Our key competitors within the Measurement & Control Solutions segment include Itron, Badger Meter, Landis+Gyr, Neptune (Roper) and Elster (Honeywell).

Supply and Seasonality
We have a global manufacturing footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia. Our inventory management and distribution practices seek to minimize inventory holding periods by striving to take delivery of the inventory and manufacturing as close as possible to the sale or distribution of products to our customers. All of our businesses require various parts and raw materials, of which the availability and prices may fluctuate. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, nickel, copper, batteries, aluminum, plastics, PCBs and electronic components. While we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements, we are still exposed to some pricing risk, including increased pricing risk due to proposed duty and tariff assessments by the United States on foreign imports. We attempt to control costs through fixed-priced contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global procurement initiative.
Our business relies on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements. For many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources are readily available.
We may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources. From time to time, we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. There have been no raw material shortages in the past several years that have had a significant adverse impact on our business as a whole.
Our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their business. This seasonality is dependent on factors such as capital spending of customers as well as weather conditions, including heavy flooding, droughts, and fluctuations in temperatures, which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business. 
Customers
Our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our Company. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated 2017, 2016 or 2015 revenue.
Backlog
Backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. Annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. As such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time. Total backlog was $1,513 million at December 31, 2017 and $1,292 million at December 31, 2016. The December 31, 2016 backlog balance has been revised to include contractual agreements that Sensus has with customers that do not have minimum commitments but which we believe will be executed upon over the terms of the contracts. We anticipate that over 60% of the backlog at December 31, 2017 will be recognized as revenue during 2018. 
Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”) is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application know-how that anticipate customer needs and emerging trends. Our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value. Our businesses invest substantial resources into R&D. We anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our R&D capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative, high-quality and reliable products and applications to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve. We continue to increase our R&D investments as a percentage of revenue year over year, with 3.8% in 2017 when compared to 2.9% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015.
We have R&D and product development capabilities around the world. R&D activities are initially conducted in our technology centers, located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to ensure an efficient and robust development process. We have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to local needs. In some cases, our R&D activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites. These piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally.
Capitalized Software
We capitalize software developed for sale to external customers, which is included within "Other intangible assets, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had net capitalized software for sale to external customers of $89 million and $54 million, respectively. 
Intellectual Property
We generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position. We believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on research and development investments. While we own, control or license a significant number of patents, trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our business, as a whole, as well as each of our core business segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights.
Patents, patent applications, and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license 
agreements has evolved over time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
Our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal, environmental remediation, and other aspects of environmental protection. Such environmental laws and regulations in the United States include, for example, the federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements significantly affect our operations. We have established an internal program to address compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, as a result, management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations.
While environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Management does not believe, based on current circumstances, that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations.
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on current law and existing technologies. It can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors. Our accrued liabilities for these environmental matters represent the best estimates related to the investigation and remediation of environmental media such as water, soil, soil vapor, air and structures, as well as related legal fees based upon the facts and circumstances as currently known to us. These estimates, and related accruals, are reviewed quarterly and updated for progress of investigation and remediation efforts and changes in facts and legal circumstances. Liabilities for these environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2017, we had estimated and accrued $4 million related to environmental matters.
Commitment to Sustainability
At Xylem, sustainability is at the very center of who we are and what we do. As a leading global water technology company, we deal with one of the world’s most urgent sustainability issues on a daily basis; responsible stewardship of our shared water resources. We believe that technology is a key link in how the world can solve water. We have a long history of innovation, but today, we’re focusing more than ever on the powerful capabilities of smart technology, integrated management and big data. These solutions will allow us to transport, treat, test and use water smarter, and more sustainably, than in the past. Our link to this enormous challenge informs how we think about sustainability and drives us to become a more sustainable company. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, Xylem had approximately 16,200 employees worldwide. We have approximately 5,400 employees in the United States, of whom approximately 16% are represented by labor unions. In certain foreign countries, our employees are represented by work councils.  We believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of workers and believe our relations with our employees are good.
