Item 1.       Business.
Our Company
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “Crimson,” “we,” “our” or “us” as used herein refer to Crimson Wine Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. Crimson has been conducting business since 1991. Prior to February 25, 2013, Crimson was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (formerly known as Leucadia National Corporation) (“Jefferies”). On February 1, 2013, Jefferies declared a pro rata dividend of all of the outstanding shares of Crimson’s common stock in a manner that was structured to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “Distribution”). Jefferies’ common shareholders received one share of Crimson common stock for every ten common shares of Jefferies, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, on February 25, 2013.
Crimson is in the business of producing and selling luxury wines (i.e., wines that retail for over $16 per 750ml bottle). Crimson is headquartered in Napa, California and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries owns seven primary wine estates and brands: Pine Ridge Vineyards, Archery Summit, Chamisal Vineyards, Seghesio Family Vineyards, Double Canyon, Seven Hills Winery and Malene Wines.
The wine Crimson makes comes from estate grown grapes as well as grapes and bulk wine purchased under contract and on the spot-market. Our business model is a combination of direct to consumer sales and wholesale distributor sales. References to cases of wine herein refer to nine-liter equivalent cases.
Vision, Essence and Strategy
Our vision and essence are as follows:
To be uncompromising cultivators of the most interesting wine experiences. Using our four strategic pillars outlined below, we seek to be a little different; a lot better. 
Enhance Capability and Culture. We foster a performance-based culture and fit-for-purpose organizational structure that broadens our capability and increases accountability. We prioritize safety and wellness. We provide a diverse and inclusive working environment with fair compensation.
Maximize Physical Assets. We produce wines of the highest quality and increase margins through investing in long-term strategic vineyards and wineries. We own exceptional vineyards in premier winegrowing regions across California, Oregon and Washington. We farm our vineyards in a thoughtful, sustainable way with the goal of producing the highest quality grapes and wines possible. As part of executing this strategy, as of December 31, 2021, Crimson owns or leases approximately 725 plantable acres of vineyard land. The Company continues to assess other opportunities to enhance the quality of its vineyard holdings and wine portfolio.
Focus on Core Brands. We invest in our core brands with compelling brand propositions and stories. We create outstanding consumer experiences, both in person and online, with a clear route to the consumer for each of our wines. We currently own seven complementary estate-based winegrowing operations and brands, with each having a unique varietal focus best suited to its specific appellation and region. We have a group of accomplished winegrowing teams who are each responsible for crafting benchmark wines from their respective premier wine growing regions. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued high ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations and we believe our scores are a reflection of our focus on what we do best.
Streamline Operational Model. We are on the journey to optimize our business model driving growth and efficiency with the Company's business partners and to build centers of excellence across business functions. With a centralized corporate model and technology-enabled efficiencies, we are committed to continuous improvement plans to better serve our internal and external stakeholders. The direct to consumer business, which continued to grow in 2021, generates higher gross margins and we intend to continue emphasizing opportunities in this distribution channel in order to further our growth. In particular, the Company is placing an increased emphasis on digital and Ecommerce opportunities within its direct to consumer business. Our wholesale distribution channel continues to drive volume sales to a wide customer market. Our wines are available in all states domestically through our network of over 40 distributors, and our export team served customers in over 30 countries through independent importers and brokers during 2021.

Double Canyon 
Double Canyon vineyard land was acquired in 2005 in the Horse Heaven Hills appellation in Washington. Starting with the 2010 vintage, the vineyard produced the first wines bottled under the Double Canyon brand name. 
In 2017, Double Canyon completed construction of a state-of-the-art 47,000-square-foot wine production facility in West Richland, Washington. The winery facility has an annual permitted wine production capacity of up to 595,000 gallons, which equates to approximately 250,000 cases of wine; however, current fermentation and processing capacity is approximately 57,000 cases. Double Canyon shares production in its facility for certain wines of Seven Hills Winery.
Double Canyon is focused on producing Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington State’s best appellations. As part of the Company's strategic initiatives targeted at supply chain management, Crimson completed its exit of the Double Canyon farming operations in January 2020 with the sale of its remaining 181 acres of land, 93 acres of which were planted with grapes. As a result, Double Canyon produces its wine from purchased grapes with long-term contracts in place for grapes from its formerly owned vineyard and from other grape purchases.
Seven Hills Winery
Seven Hills Winery was established in 1988 and acquired by Crimson in January 2016. Seven Hills owns acreage in the Walla Walla Valley. Included within the acreage are some of the oldest and highest quality Bordeaux varietal plantings in the Walla Walla Valley. This historic site, considered the original Seven Hills Winery estate acreage, was planted by the Seven Hills Winery founder and his father. Also included within the acreage are plantings in The Rocks District of Milton-Freewater, which is known for world class Rhone style wines. The winery facility has an annual permitted wine production capacity of up to 48,000 gallons, which equates to approximately 20,000 cases of wine; however, current fermentation and processing capacity is approximately 11,000 cases. The winery and tasting room are located in downtown Walla Walla in the Crimson-owned historic Whitehouse-Crawford building. The 15,463 square-foot facility includes areas and equipment for crush, fermentation, aging, bottling processes, as well as a tasting room and administrative offices. There are indoor and outdoor special event dining areas.
Seven Hills Winery is focused on producing Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Sauvignon Blanc, which are produced from esteemed vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley and the Red Mountain appellations, from both estate grown and purchased grapes. The wines are sold by Crimson under the Seven Hills Winery brand name.
Malene Wines
Malene Wines was created by Crimson in 2016 with the goal of creating America’s reference point premium Rosé with a sole focus on premium Rosé produced in the U.S. Malene Wines sources fruit from specific sites throughout the Central Coast intentionally farmed for world class Rosé winemaking. In 2017, utilizing fallow ground Crimson owns in the Edna Valley, we planted 5 estate acres to Grenache specifically dedicated for Malene Rosé. There are an additional 26 fallow acres in the Edna Valley that the Company could plant to further expand estate grapes for Malene Wines. 
Malene Wines are sold by Crimson under its own brand name and are made from purchased grapes processed at Crimson's sister estate Chamisal Vineyards’ winemaking facility. In 2018, Malene Wines created a home and outdoor experience with a luxurious Airstream tasting experience in the Edna Valley where consumers can join the wine club and gain access to a fresh new series of exclusive Rosés. 
Competition
The markets for luxury products in the wine industry are intensely competitive. Crimson’s wines compete domestically and internationally with premium or higher quality wines produced in Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States. Crimson competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution capability, and the ultimate consumer has many choices of products from both domestic and international producers. As a result of the intense competition and how uncertain tariffs have been, and may continue to be, there is upward pressure on Crimson’s selling and promotional expenses. Many of Crimson’s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources. Measured in wine volume, the U.S. is dominated by three large wine companies with production largely based in California, representing approximately 50% of the domestic U.S. case sales volume. Further, Crimson’s wines may be considered to compete with all alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages.
Demand for luxury wines can rise and fall with general economic conditions. In 2021, the wine industry saw a recovery in visitations to tasting rooms, restaurants, bars, and other hospitality locations previously impacted by shutdowns and operating restrictions. The peak demand experienced in 2020 within the Company's Ecommerce channel declined in 2021 as consumers shifted purchasing and consumption behaviors towards other purchasing channels previously restricted by the coronavirus disease pandemic (“COVID-19”). With 2021 reopenings, the Company's On-Premise wine sales made a significant recovery but remain below the 2019 levels observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand for wine sales in Off-Premise locations remain strong for the Company with increased points of distributions and premiumization of at-home wine consumption.
Wine production is also significantly affected by grape and bulk wine supply. Following a historic wildfire season across California, Oregon, and Washington in 2020, the 2021 harvest was impacted by drought resulting in lower yields than historical averages. The compounding loss of the 2020 vintage with the lower yields of the 2021 vintage may cause upward pricing pressure on the bulk wine market. Depending on the wine, the production cycle from harvest to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years.
Suggested retail price points for Crimson’s wines range from $16 to $395 per bottle; however, in the wholesale channel, which represented 87% and 85% of Crimson’s case volume in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the majority of volume is in the $16 to $30 suggested retail price range.
Business Segments
Crimson reports operating results in two segments: Wholesale and Direct to Consumer. These business segments reflect how the Company’s operations are evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. Both financial and certain non-financial data are reported and evaluated to assist senior management with strategic planning. The Company evaluates performance based on the gross profit of the respective business segments. Selling expenses that can be directly attributable to the segment are included; however, centralized selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are not allocated between operating segments. Non-allocated expenses are reported under Other/Non-allocable which also includes revenues and expenses related to bulk wine and grape sales, event fees, tasting fees and non-wine retail sales. Therefore, net income information for the respective segments is not available. Based on the nature of the Company’s business, revenue generating assets are utilized across segments. As a result, discrete financial information related to segment assets and other balance sheet data is not available and that information continues to be aggregated. Further information about segments, including net sales, cost of sales, gross profit (loss), directly attributable selling expenses, and contribution margin of the segments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 can be found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing
Crimson focuses on brand development and distribution to increase revenues and profitability, which has included acquisitions of vineyards and wineries and the development of new brands with existing assets and the development of new direct sales outlets.
Crimson’s sales and marketing team coordinates the sales and distribution of its various brands, maintains domestic and export distributor relationships and oversees the timing and allocation of new releases. The sales team has employees in major markets in the U.S. and, where required, has brokers in certain domestic and international markets. Crimson’s wines are available through many principal retail channels for premium table wines, including fine wine restaurants, hotels, specialty shops, supermarkets and club stores, in all states domestically, as well as cruise lines and over 30 countries throughout the world.
Crimson believes that the quality and locations of its wineries and tasting facilities help to create demand for its brands at the consumer level, which positively impacts sales to distributors as well. Crimson participates in many wine tasting and other promotional events throughout the country in order to increase awareness and demand for its products. Many of Crimson’s brands are issued ratings or scores by local and national wine rating organizations, and higher scores will usually translate into greater demand and higher pricing.
Wholesale
Crimson’s wines are primarily sold to distributors, who then sell to retailers and restaurants. Domestic sales of Crimson’s wines are made through over 40 independent wine and spirits distributors. International sales are made through independent importers and brokers. During 2021, domestic distributor sales represented 49% of net sales and export sales represented 5% of net sales. During 2021, one distributor represented approximately 28% of Crimson’s total sales and no other distributor represented 10% or more of total sales.
Direct to Consumer
As permitted under federal and local regulations, Crimson has been placing an increased emphasis on direct sales to consumers, through Ecommerce, wine clubs, and at the wineries’ tasting rooms. In particular, Crimson has been placing an increased emphasis on digital and Ecommerce opportunities. During 2021, direct sales to consumers represented 41% of net sales. Approximately 57% of the direct to consumer net sales were through wine clubs, 23% were through the wineries’ tasting rooms, special events and other sales, and 20% from Ecommerce. Members typically join our wine clubs after visiting our tasting rooms at various facilities, signing up directly through our website, or after hearing about our wine clubs from other members. Although COVID-19-related closures and restrictions significantly reduced traffic to our tasting rooms in 2020, traffic and visitations have rebounded considerably in 2021, coinciding with the phased lifting of operating restrictions. Our tasting rooms are located in popular tourist destinations that typically attract consumers interested in winemaking and travel. Direct sales to consumers are more profitable for Crimson as it is able to sell its products at a price closer to retail prices rather than the wholesale price received from distributors; however, for certain direct sales offers, some of the profit is offset by freight subsidies.
Grape Supply
Crimson controls approximately 725 acres of vineyards in the Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Edna Valley in California, and the Willamette Valley, The Rocks District, and the Walla Walla Valley in Oregon. Approximately 594 acres of these vineyards are planted. Crimson expects to continue vineyard development plans for non-producing acreage in California, Oregon and Washington properties. Newly planted vines take approximately three to five years to reach maturity and vineyards can be expected to have a useful life of at least 25 years before replanting is necessary. Depending on the site, soil and water conditions and spacing, Crimson’s experience has been that it costs approximately $37,000 to $132,000 per acre over a three year period to develop open land into a vineyard capable of producing premium wine grapes, before taking into account the cost of the land. During 2021, the average cost per acre placed into service was approximately $75,000 per acre.
Following a historic wildfire season across California, Oregon, and Washington in 2020, the 2021 harvest was impacted by drought resulting in lower yields than historical averages. In 2021, approximately 22% of Crimson’s total grape supply came from Crimson-controlled vineyards. Crimson purchased the balance of its supply from approximately 97 independent growers. The grower contracts range from one-year spot market purchases to intermediate and long term-agreements. During 2021, two growers represented 11% and 10% of Crimson’s grape supply. 
Winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks. Various diseases, pests, natural disasters and certain climate conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to Crimson, thereby materially and adversely affecting the supply of Crimson’s products and its profitability. Given the risks presented by climate conditions and extreme weather, Crimson regularly evaluates the impacts of climate conditions and weather on its business and plans to disclose any material impacts on the business. Along with various insurance policies currently in place, Crimson has made investments to improve its climate resilience and strives to effectively manage grape sourcing to help mitigate the impact of climate change and unforeseen natural disasters. During 2021, Crimson completed upgrades to its facilities to improve water resilience and fire mitigation measures with plans to advance these initiatives through improvements of irrigation and water systems over the next several years.
The table below summarizes Crimson’s wine grape supply and production from the last two harvests:

 | Harvest Year
 | 2021 | 2020 | 
Estate grapes: | | | 
Producing acres | 547 | | 557 
Tons harvested | 1,249 | | 1,351 
Tons per acre | 2.3 | | 2.4 
All grapes and purchased juice (in equivalent tons): | | | 
Estate grapes | 1,249 | | 1,351 
Purchased grapes and juice | 4,530 | | 3,199 
Total (in tons) | 5,779 | | 4,550 
Total cases bottled during the year | 276,000 | | 357,000

Following a historic wildfire season across California, Oregon, and Washington in 2020, the 2021 harvest was impacted by drought resulting in lower yields than historical averages.
The table below summarizes Crimson’s sales of grapes and bulk wine during the last two years:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | 2020 | 
Grapes sold (in tons) | 155 | | 71 
Bulk wine sold (in gallons) | 91,858 | | 181,515
Total grape and bulk wine equivalent cases sold | 49,000 | | 81,000 

Total cases shipped were approximately 376,000 and 343,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cases shipped are disclosed for informational purposes, but do not necessarily correspond to the vintage year the grapes are grown and crushed. Depending on the wine, the production cycle to bottled sales is anywhere from one to three years.
Winemaking
Crimson’s winemaking philosophy includes the use of the latest industry winemaking advances to complement making wine in the traditional manner by starting with high quality fruit and handling it as gently and naturally as possible all the way to the bottle. Each of Crimson’s wineries is equipped with modern crush, fermentation and storage equipment as well as technology that is focused on producing the highest quality wines for each of the varietals it produces.
Government Regulation 
Wine production and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), state departments regulating alcohol production and sale in California, Oregon and Washington and other state and federal governmental authorities that regulate interstate sales, licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising and other activities. In addition, federal and state authorities require warning labels on beverages for sale or distribution in the United States containing 0.5% of alcohol by volume or higher. Restrictions or taxes imposed by government authorities on the sale of wine could increase the retail price of wine, which could have an adverse effect on demand for wine in general. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees or excise taxes on wine, if enacted, could reduce demand for wine and have an adverse effect on Crimson’s business, negatively impacting Crimson’s results of operations and cash flows.
On January 1, 2018, the 2017 Craft Beverage Modernization Act (“CBMA”) became effective as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Public Law 115-97) and made extensive changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“IRC”), including provisions related to alcohol that were administered by TTB favorably impacting the federal alcohol tax rate.  The federal alcohol tax rate changed effective January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the CBMA was extended through December 31, 2020, maintaining the reduced federal alcohol tax rates in place at the time. On December 27, 2020, the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Act of 2020 was passed, which permanently extended the reduced tax rates and tax credits made available by the CBMA. The previous rate of $1.07 per gallon for wines with alcohol content at or below 14% has been permanently modified to apply to wines with alcohol content at or below 16%. The previous tax rate of $1.57 per gallon for 
wines above 14% but less than 21% has been permanently modified to apply to wines over 16%. The tax rates for wines with alcohol content over 21% has not changed.
The tax law also allows for certain volume production credits that the Company took which further decreases the Company’s excise tax liability.  The tax credit allows for a credit of $1.00 per gallon on the first 30,000 gallons, $.90 per gallon on 30,001 up to 130,000 gallons and $.535 per gallon on 130,001 up to 750,000 gallons when the wine is removed from a producer’s bonded winery facility. 
Crimson is also subject to a broad range of federal and state regulatory requirements regarding its agricultural operations and practices. Crimson’s agricultural operations are subject to regulations governing the storage and use of fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, pesticides, fuels, solvents and other chemicals. These regulations are subject to change and could have a significant impact on operating practices, chemical usage, and other aspects of Crimson’s business. The Company is strongly focused on environmental stewardship and maintains a variety of policies and processes designed to protect the environment, the public and the consumers of our wine. Crimson is an active member of the Porto Protocol, a nonprofit organization committed to mitigate climate change. In addition, many of the Company's vineyards are certified sustainable through a number of organizations (California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance, Napa Green, Low Input Viticulture and Enology, Sustainability in Practice, along with several others). Some examples of our sustainable practices include waste reduction programs and resource preservation through a combination of electrical and water conservancy. In addition, the Company has formed a Carbon Neutral Council with commitments to become carbon neutral and to minimize the Company's carbon footprint. Furthering these efforts, Crimson has joined the International Wineries for Climate Action ("IWCA"). IWCA members follow science-based solutions to reduce their greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and are adhering to the United Nation race to zero campaign that require Crimson to halve GHG emissions by 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Many of the expenses for protecting the environment are voluntary, however we are regulated by various local, state and federal agencies regarding environmental laws where the costs of these laws and requirements of these agencies are effectively integrated into regular operations and do not cause significant negative impacts or costs.
Seasonality
There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of grapes. The wine industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. Typically, Crimson has lower sales and net income during the first quarter and higher sales and net income during the fourth quarter due to seasonal holiday buying as well as wine club shipment timing. Crimson expects these trends to continue. 
Human Capital Management
In addition to Crimson’s customer base and surrounding communities, the Company’s success is greatly dependent on its employees. As of December 31, 2021, Crimson employed 156 regular, full-time employees. Crimson also employs part-time and seasonal workers for its vineyard, production and hospitality operations. None of Crimson’s employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and Crimson believes that its relationship with its employees is strong and in good standing.
Crimson prioritizes employee safety and welfare in order to retain and attract the best talent. Crimson offers quality benefit plans, employee development programs, competitive wages, and safety training courses so that employees can avoid injury and remain prepared for unexpected emergencies.
Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic and Employee Wellness
The safety of our employees is a top priority. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s Crisis Management Team, composed of the Company's Executive Officers and other senior leaders, deployed resources and protocols to accommodate the needs and protect the health and safety of its employees. The Company quickly transitioned its office employees to a remote-work arrangement, and continued to extend these arrangements as new variants emerged. The Company provided equipment, systems, and resources for home connection to employees to facilitate this transition. Crimson provided employees working from home with a stipend to support home office needs. Crimson has continued to support the physical and mental health of employees and their families by offering online wellness resources, webinars, and telehealth access. To ensure employee safety, the Crisis Management Team issued COVID-19 operations guidelines to all employees, specifically to those working in the areas of production, vineyards, tasting rooms, and sales teams. In addition, the Crisis Management Team encouraged employees to only travel for essential needs, suspending all business travel during certain periods and implemented reporting protocols for international travels. The Company will continue to monitor public health announcements and government orders to accommodate additional changes as necessary.
Recruitment, Retention and Development
Competitive compensation is the primary driver of employee recruiting and retention. The Company believes in competitive pay practices and a pay-for-performance culture. In addition to competitive pay, eligible employees may receive the following Company benefits:
•Employees may qualify for an annual cash bonus plan or sales commission plans tied to individual and company performances.
•Employees may choose to participate in the Company's 401(k) plan in which the Company matches employee contributions up to a set percentage.
•Employees are offered selections of health insurance plans and the majority of plan premium costs for employees are paid for by the Company.
•Employees with an eligible Health Savings Account receive Company-funded annual contributions in addition to each employee's contributions.
•Employees are offered paid parental leave and the Company supplements the portion of base pay not covered by state benefits to bring wages equal to 100% of an employee's base pay.
•Employees are provided with a set number of paid holidays, vacation, sick leave, and birthday holiday.
•Employees are encouraged to achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle with monthly reimbursements towards eligible health and fitness membership fees.
•Employees operating in a remote environment are provided with annual stipends to support home office needs.
•Employees have access to training programs that provide management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development.
The Company believes continued investments in talent development and employee wellness are integral to operational excellence and employee retention. The Company continually reviews compensation against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are competitive.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging
Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging ("DEIB") plays an integral part of the Company’s culture and processes that support recruitment, retention, and development. DEIB accountability has been increasingly important for consumers, employees, and all stakeholders. Crimson has made improvements in gender diversity. The majority of our executive officers and two of our seven board members are female. We are determined through our newly formed, employee-led DEIB council to expand our efforts around these important topics. Differing perspectives and backgrounds make all companies, Crimson included, enduring; the diversity of our company should reflect the diversity of our consumers.
Trademarks
Crimson maintains federal trademark registrations for its brands, proprietary products and certain logos, motifs and vineyard names. International trademark registrations are also maintained where it is appropriate to do so. Each of the United States trademark registrations is renewable indefinitely so long as the Company is making a bona fide usage of the trademark. The Company believes that its trademarks provide it with an important competitive advantage and has established a global network of attorneys, as well as branding, advertising and licensing professionals, to procure, maintain, protect, enhance and gain value from these registrations.

These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “forecast,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “likely,” and other words of similar expression.
Forward-looking statements give our expectations about the future and are not guarantees. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance and achievements to materially differ from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, not to rely on these forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted that may materially and adversely affect the Company’s actual results include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

These forward-looking statements are applicable only as of the date hereof. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to modify or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Report.
