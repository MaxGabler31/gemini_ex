Item 1. Business
Destination XL Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), is the leading specialty retailer of big & tall men’s apparel with retail locations throughout the United States. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL®, DXL®, DXL Men’s Apparel, DXL outlets, Casual Male XL® and Casual Male XL outlets. At January 29, 2022, we operated 220 DXL retail stores, 16 DXL outlet stores, 35 Casual Male XL retail stores, 19 Casual Male XL outlet stores, and a digital business, including an e-commerce site at www.dxl.com, a mobile site m.destinationXL.com and mobile app. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020 as “fiscal 2021,” “fiscal 2020” and “fiscal 2019,” respectively.
 OUR INDUSTRY
We define the big & tall men’s clothing market as starting at a waist size of 38” and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater. Growth in this segment historically has been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well.
We believe the total core addressable market for big & tall men’s clothing and shoes is approximately $10 billion. We determined this core market, defined as sizes XXL+ and waist sizes 42”+, with assistance from The NPD Group.
HISTORY
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name "Kara Enterprises, Inc." and subsequently did business under the name "Designs, Inc." Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss & Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men’s clothing in the big & tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name to “Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.” In fiscal 2004, we


acquired the Rochester Clothing stores. Through fiscal 2010, we catered to customers through our three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores).
 In fiscal 2010, we launched a new store concept, Destination XL (“DXL”). The DXL store concept offers our customers an extensive assortment of products, ranging from value-oriented to luxury-oriented with an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with a unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL stores, with larger fitting rooms and professional, trained associates providing personal attention. With the initial success of this store format, we made a similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we launched our DestinationXL.com website (now dxl.com). In fiscal 2019, we closed our five remaining Rochester Clothing stores.
OUR BUSINESS
 We operate as an omni-channel retailer of big & tall men’s clothing and shoes. Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we provide a premium, personalized shopping experience, whether in-store or digitally, with a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop.
What is unique about our business is our proprietary fit, our ability to manage an array of sizes, and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 58 size combinations and a unique specification as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations. We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels that enables us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location’s market potential without excessive inventory levels.
Our DXL retail stores, e-commerce site, dxl.com, and mobile app cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise to fit a variety of lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. In addition, we also offer a selection of shoes in sizes 10W to 18W on our website at dxl.com. Our Casual Male XL retail stores primarily carry moderate-priced branded and private-label casual sportswear and dresswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented customers. Through digital marketplaces, we are able to extend our reach, by providing a select offering of our merchandise to new customers who may not be current DXL customers.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The structural changes to our business model and the digital transformative work we have accomplished is driving our customers to engage with our brand in new and meaningful ways which together create a bright future for DXL. We strive to deliver a differentiated experience that we believe will resonate with big and tall guys everywhere and our business strategy remains focused on driving initiatives in marketing, technology, and merchandising.
In fiscal 2022, our key initiatives include the following:
 •Digital growth. We have seen substantive growth in our direct business over the past two years and we believe that this shows the sustainability of our digital transformation and our ability to stand out as an omni-channel retail company. This digital growth is not just limited to our DXL.com website and mobile app lead; we have seen growth from third-party marketplaces. We offer our B&T Essentials on Amazon Marketplace, specifically aimed at the value-oriented consumer. We believe these additional avenues will attract a new customer to DXL and increase our brand awareness. We look to further build upon these objectives in fiscal 2022. 
 •Marketing initiatives.  We have executed a marketing strategy that is responsive to changes in customer shopping habits and behaviors through CRM segmentation, unique personas and personalization of digital interaction such as one-to-one marketing email messaging. Our focus in fiscal 2022 will be building brand awareness to achieve greater market share, the acquisition of new customers, and investing in customer reactivation. For fiscal 2021, our new-to-file increased 27% as compared to fiscal 2019. We want to build off of that growth in fiscal 2022. Our marketing efforts will continue to be primarily digitally-driven, as we continue to develop a more personalized one-on-one connection with our customers. 
 •Merchandising initiatives. Over the past few years, we have narrowed our assortment, reducing the number of brands we carry and instead focusing on the development of the assortments and exclusivity. Beginning in the spring of fiscal 2022, we will be adding merchandise from Nautica and vineyard vines to our existing list of exclusive brands. We are aiming to add even more brand exclusivity to our current merchandise selection, allowing us to differentiate ourselves within the big and 
 

tall market. Since the latter half of fiscal 2020, we have shifted to a more full-price messaging with fewer merchandise discounts, separating us from other retailers by focusing on our proprietary fit, exclusive merchandise selection and the unique DXL shopping experience.
MERCHANDISE
We offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers’ age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit their apparel needs. We offer such assortments in both private-label product and a wide array of brand-name labels. With over 6,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 8XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38” to 70”, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18W. Big and tall is all we do.
 What sets us apart from our competitors is our proprietary fit. We are different because our fit is different. Our merchandise is not just an extension of regular sizes. The fit is built from unique specifications for every size and style, with specific design features for the big and tall customer.
Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, modern and denim. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space and product assortment effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition.
Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle but, within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a “good,” “better” and “best” visual presentation. With the “best” merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. Our website and select DXL stores also offer certain “luxury” brands.
We carry over 100 well-known national brands (“branded apparel”) as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our “good,” “better” and “best” price points. The penetration of branded apparel in a specific DXL store can range from 39% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, approximately half of the assortment is branded apparel.
Several of the national brands that we carry, in sizes 2XL and above, are sold exclusively by us in our stores and on our website and may be available on the brand’s website. In January 2022, we announced that we were adding Nautica and vineyard vines to our list of exclusive brands for Spring 2022. In addition to our exclusive brands, we also work with several other national brands to offer a unique, curated merchandise assortment, in sizes 2XL and above, that are exclusively sold in our stores and on our website and are not available from the brand’s own website. These offerings are a subset of the larger merchandise offering that we carry for these respective brands.
Value-Priced Apparel -“Good” Merchandise
For our value-oriented customers, we carry Champion, Lee, Wrangler and Reebok. Within our product assortment for Champion, we offer exclusive styles specially curated for our customers. In addition, we carry several value-priced private label lines:
•Harbor Bay® was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line that continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise. 
 •Gold Series is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrics with basic wardrobe essentials. 
 •Synrgy targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look. 
 •Oak Hill® is a premier line catering to those customers looking for slightly more style and quality than our Harbor Bay line but still in a traditional lifestyle. 
 •True Nation® is a denim-inspired line consisting of vintage-screen t-shirts and wovens and is geared towards our younger customers. 
 •Society of One® is an activewear brand that offers versatile styling options and is grounded by performance technology. 
 Moderate-Priced Apparel -“Better” Merchandise
We offer our customer an extensive selection of quality sportswear and dress clothing at moderate prices carrying well-known brands such as: Cutter & Buck®, Levi's®, Columbia, Carhartt®, and Jockey®. Our exclusive brands in this price range in O’Neill®, Nautica® and Nautica Jeans®, Adidas Golf® and vineyard vines®. Within our product assortment for Callaway®, Lacoste®, Majestic and Tommy Bahama® we also offer exclusive styles specially curated for our customers.
Higher-End Fashion Apparel -“Best” Merchandise
Within this higher-end price range, we carry a broad selection of quality apparel from well-known branded manufacturers, such as The North Face®, Polo Ralph Lauren®, Jack Victor®, Michael Kors®, and Tallia®. Our exclusive brands in this price range include Brooks Brothers®, JOE’S® Jeans, 7 for all Mankind®, and Robert Barakett®. Within our product assortment for Psycho Bunny®, Lucky and Robert Graham® we also offer exclusive styles specially curated for our customers.
Shoes
 Our DXL website offers an assortment of footwear, with a broad selection from casual to formal, in varying price points. We currently have a selection of more than 200 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18W, including designer brands such as Cole Haan®, Timberland®, Sketchers, New Balance, Reebok and Deerstags.
STORE CHANNEL
DXL Men’s Apparel Stores
At January 29, 2022, we operated 220 DXL retail stores. Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we cater to our diverse customer base, with merchandise representing all price points, from our higher-end brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim. The size of our DXL stores averages 7,600 square feet, but since fiscal 2016 we have opened smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores. Because of the smaller size of these stores, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the “good, better, best” merchandise variety. Our DXL stores are located on real estate that is highly visible, often adjacent to high-performing regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.
 Our DXL stores offer up to three times the product offering of a Casual Male XL store. Depending on the customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market.
Over the past few years, we have rebranded select Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores to the DXL retail and outlet store concept. In many markets, rebranding a Casual Male XL store to a DXL store provides a viable alternative to the more costly endeavor of relocating a Casual Male XL store to new DXL real estate. In addition, the converted stores benefit from DXL advertising. We are actively reviewing opportunities to relocate or convert Casual Male XL stores to DXL and we are reviewing white space opportunities in markets where our store footprint is underpenetrated. We expect to continue to invest in stores over the next several years as we further strengthen the store portfolio.
 Casual Male XL Retail Stores
At January 29, 2022, we operated 35 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our “better” private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,300 square feet.
DXL Outlet /Casual Male XL Outlet Stores
 At January 29, 2022, we operated 16 DXL outlet stores and 19 Casual Male XL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big & tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the merchandise in our outlet stores is offered at discounted prices to cater to the value-oriented customer. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our “good” price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL and Casual Male XL stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded and fashion product for a reduced price.
The average DXL outlet is approximately 5,000 square feet and the average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,000 square feet.
DIRECT CHANNEL
Our direct business is a critical channel for growing sales and market share through new customer acquisition and digital engagement of the active file. In the past two years, our direct business grew 45.3% in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2019 and represented approximately 31.0% of our total retail sales in fiscal 2021, as compared to 23.1% of our retail sales in fiscal 2019. Through our digital efforts and marketplace presence, we are creating brand awareness and attracting a new customer to DXL. For fiscal 2021, our new-to-file increased 27% as compared to fiscal 2019. We believe that this new-to-file growth indicates that our investments in digital marketing and the optimization of our digital infrastructure are resonating with new customers.
 

We define our direct business as sales that originate online, whether through our website, our app, those initiated online at the store level, our Guest Engagement Center, or through a third-party marketplace. We want to serve our customers wherever and how they want to shop, whether in-person at a store, over the telephone, or online via a computer, smartphone or tablet.
A key to being a successful omni-channel retailer is having the ability to showcase all of our store inventories online, resulting in additional transactions that are initiated online, but are ultimately completed in store. In addition, our stores are able to fulfill an order for an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse. This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and manage margins.
 DXL Website and App
 Our DXL website and app have been instrumental in our growth over the past two years, with sales from our website and app together increasing 55.3% from fiscal 2019. We continue to see our consumers shift to online shopping helping to drive higher new customer acquisition for the website business.
Digital Sales at Store Level
 In support of our omni-channel approach, our store associates use our website to help fulfill our in-store customers’ clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our customer online through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to shop-by-store and pick-up in store on the same day.
Digital Marketplaces
 We continue to broaden our reach through digital, third-party marketplaces. A large portion of our assortment is available on Amazon.com and Target.com. Digital marketplaces provide us an opportunity to drive awareness, grow our customer base and introduce new customers to our brand.
 WHOLESALE CHANNEL
Our wholesale business focuses on the product development, manufacturing and distribution of big and tall product. This initiative allows us to leverage our existing infrastructure, including DXL’s expertise in technical design and global sourcing. Our wholesale business was driven primarily by our relationship with Amazon. Based on several factors, including low margins, volatility in the global supply chain, increasing lead times and the shifting dynamics of the business, the Company and Amazon have agreed to end the wholesale relationship.
 MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION
Our merchandise planning and allocation function is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the stores and for the direct channel, and pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channel. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made, and we will continue to make, investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation.
Our core merchandise made up approximately 42% of our merchandise assortment in fiscal 2021. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We develop customized assortment strategies by store that accentuate lifestyle preferences for each particular store.
Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, identifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categories, overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportunities and challenges for the next season’s planning cycle.
Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, the merchandise planning and allocation team is able to fulfill their daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We are confident that our inventory performance is optimized by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools.
STORE OPERATIONS
We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customers. The culture in our stores is to be guest centric in an effort to engage and build a relationship with our guests. Our overall goal is to accomplish three key initiatives in our stores. The first is that we strive to build relationships with all of our guests. The second is that we believe our stores need to be clean, neat and organized in an effort to allow the "just-looking" customer to find what he needs with ease. The last component is our stores serving as mini-distribution centers. The majority of our stores are able to fulfill customer orders for product that we may not have in our distribution center. Our associates are well versed in not only the product selection carried in their specific store, but also the product selection carried online. With a point-of-sale system that can access items online for the customer who is physically in the store, our associates are able to fulfill all of their customers’ needs.
Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates who are the correct fit for our stores. All new DXL store management team hires are trained extensively through senior peer trainers throughout the country. We believe having a mix of internal promotes (store manager to Regional Sales Manager) as well as external hires with extensive multi-unit background gives us an inclusive and diverse Regional Sales management team. Regional Vice Presidents give us touch-points in the field in addition to our Regional Sales Managers and store management team to ensure consistency in executing our standards and all programs and processes we deem important to our success.
 Each new member of the store management team goes through extensive training with their Regional Sales Manager and a peer Store Manager. We believe our training system, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer’s brand loyalty.
Our field organization is overseen by our Senior Vice President of Store Sales and Operations, Regional Vice Presidents, Regional Sales Managers, and a Store Operations Team, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager’s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. Each store is staffed with a store manager, assistant manager and key holders. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our stores have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer’s wardrobing needs and sales productivity.
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on our store operations during fiscal 2021. While the majority of our stores remained opened throughout fiscal 2021, we experienced some limited store closures throughout the year as a result of reduced store operating hours and staff shortages. Several of the safety protocols we implemented in fiscal 2020 are still in place. In addition, the majority of our stores continue to offer the option for no-contact, curbside pickup, through our BOPAC (buy online and pickup at curbside) and BOPIS (buy online pick-up in store) programs. For the safety of our field organization, our stores are equipped with iPads to enable our Regional Sales Managers and members of our senior leadership team the ability to engage with stores on a more frequent basis without the risk of travel.
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING
We believe that our marketing initiatives are key to driving our sales growth by increasing traffic to our stores, website and app. We are transforming our brand positioning by targeting our addressable market and focusing on our distinct advantages, which is a brand built around our proprietary fit, a specially-curated, extensive and often exclusive merchandise offering and an experience built around the respect, value and trust for our customers. Our focus is to acquire new customers and achieve a greater lifetime value across our entire customer file.
 We have shifted our marketing strategy away from a broad-based shotgun advertising to a more targeted, personalized, data-driven model where we can segment and ultimately engage differently with each of our customers based on their shopping behaviors across all our buying channels. We adopted a stringent, analytical perspective to our marketing program, focusing on understanding incremental outcomes in addition to the “return on ad spend” throughout all of our programs. This data-driven philosophy extends across all of our marketing initiatives as we look at new ways to engage our customers. Our on-going work on enhancing our customer segmentation will ultimately drive our long-term marketing strategy, enabling us to create targeted and personalized content and messaging to our various customer segments.
Our marketing programs includes email, direct mail, loyalty program, direct marketing, digital marketing, social media, and streaming media, among others. Driving new-to-file growth and strengthening our brand positioning with our active file are key to our overall long-term growth and we expect to increase our marketing costs in fiscal 2022 to approximately 6% of sales to support these initiatives. For fiscal 2021, marketing costs were 4.7% of sales.
GLOBAL SOURCING
Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach, which considers quality, cost and lead-time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure meets our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to the strength of merchandise margins.
We have built a strong internal team with extensive experience that is responsible for managing an international network of vendors and suppliers across the globe. We have established strong relationships with many of the leading factories and mills across the globe. Our sourcing network consists of over 28 factories in nine countries which are experts in big & tall sizing and production. In fiscal 2021, approximately 52% of all our product needs were sourced directly. We manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise in Southeast Asian countries consisting of Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and India. We continue to reduce dependency on China, inclusive of our raw materials and trims, and have moved certain programs into the Western Hemisphere with duty-free opportunities such as Nicaragua and Mexico.
In 2020, we retained Elevate Ltd., a global leader in supply chain assessment, and instituted 4-Pillar audits of our manufacturing facilities. Our intent is to increase our social, environmental and ethical sustainability by utilizing Elevates audit tool, "ERSA", which stands for ELEVATE Responsible Sourcing Assessment. ERSA 2.0 covers social compliance, human rights, environmental business ethics, and worker’s sentiment surveys. All audits can be found on their EIQ tool which is a web-based analytical system on which we participate in their Ethical Trade Audit platform. Through collaboration with Elevate Ltd., we are currently pursuing a “5-Pillar Audit”, which includes traceability of both raw materials and the equipment used to produce finished goods. We expect to roll out this program in 2022. Our intention is to increase our audit pillars to include all of our raw material suppliers that procure fabric, trims and inner components of our products.
In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars with payment on account.
DISTRIBUTION
All of our retail distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. We believe that having a centralized distribution facility maximizes the selling space and in-stock position of our stores and reduces the necessary levels of back-room stock. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. In-bound calls for our e-commerce business are received at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center. If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level. For our wholesale business, during fiscal 2021 we utilized three coastal third-party cross-dock facilities.
 Our supply chain technology provides visibility for imports and domestic deliveries giving our buyers accurate shipping information and allowing the distribution center to plan staffing for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency.
Our warehousing application and labor management system enable us to streamline our distribution processes, enhance our in-transit times, and reduce our distribution costs. We will continually work to make improvements and upgrades to our software.
Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (“UPS”) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our direct customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more convenient for them. In October 2019, we renewed our contract with UPS through October 2022. We also entered into an agreement with the United States Postal Service to utilize their services when shipping from stores.
In order to service our International customers, we have contracted with a global e-commerce company for payment and shipment services. Through this service, international customers view and pay for products in their local currency. Our vendor then ships directly to our customer, which we believe helps avoid potential fraud and currency exchange rate risks.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 The infrastructure of our management information systems is a priority to us. We believe that the investments we have made in this regard have improved our overall efficiency and improved our access to information enabling timely, data-driven decisions.
Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems, which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business.


Using a retail business intelligence solution, we are able to integrate data from several sources and provide enterprise-wide analytics reporting. Over the past few years, we have continued to develop a custom Assortment Suite application. In an effort to improve our inventory management, we have created a standardized set of “best practices” for both our merchandise planning and allocation groups.
Our direct and retail channels maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single-system platform for our DXL and Casual Male XL stores to deliver improved efficiencies.
During fiscal 2021, we began the process of upgrading our Assortment Suite application to leverage business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high-impact insights into core merchandising tasks. In addition, we continued to upgrade our security measures, including employing a Security Incident Event Management system.
 During fiscal 2022, we will continue upgrading our Assortment Suite and plan to roll-out a new point-of-sale system.
 COMPETITION
Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores, mass merchandisers, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers that sell big & tall men’s clothing. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours. Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has many competitors, including the King Size catalog and website as well as online marketplaces, such as Amazon.
The United States big & tall men’s clothing market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours, the similarity being that the clothes they sell are intended for big and tall men. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of men’s apparel stores focused exclusively on the men’s big & tall market.
SEASONALITY
Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income, net income, and free cash flow. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income, net income, and free cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter, because of the holiday season. Our inventory is typically at peak levels by the end of the third quarter, which represents a significant use of cash, which is then relieved in the fourth quarter as we sell-down our inventory through the holiday shopping season.
TRADEMARKS/TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENTS
We own several service marks and trademarks relating to our businesses, including, among others, “Destination XL®”, “DXL®”, “DXL Mens Apparel®”, “Big on Being Better®”, “Casual Male®”, “Casual Male XL®”, “Harbor Bay®”, “Oak Hill®”, “Continuous Comfort®”, “Synrgy”, “Society of One®” and “True Nation®”. We also hold a U.S. patent for an extendable collar system, which is marketed as “Neck-Relaxer®” and a U.S. copyright for a no-iron hang tag.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
 At DXL, corporate social responsibility and sustainability has been a focus for many years and we recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues. We are diligently working to enhance and develop a platform that we can share with our stakeholders. During fiscal 2021, we formed the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, comprising a cross-discipline of corporate management and engaged with a third-party firm to assist us in the development of the Company's ESG policies and initiatives.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 As of January 29, 2022, we had 1,353 employees. We hire additional temporary employees during the peak Fall and Holiday seasons. None of our employees is represented by any collective bargaining agreement. Our associates are our greatest asset and we are committed to providing them a safe and healthy work environment. Each associate is required to sign a set of policies that include, among other policies, the code of ethics, anti-harassment and procedures for raising a complaint. Our policies also contain protection of human rights and prohibit, among other things, the use of child labor or forced, bonded or indentured labor.
Inclusion and Diversity
 

We are committed to inclusivity, acceptance, and equality. Since 2017, we have had a diversity and inclusion initiative called “Normalizing the Brand.” The program brings awareness to unconscious bias and focuses on ensuring that the composition of our organization looks and feels like the communities where we live and serve. We have policies and training in place with respect to anti-discrimination and anti-harassment, among others, and provide our associates with access to an anonymous hot-line for reporting any concerns. Throughout the year, we require our associates to participate in educational videos. In early 2022, we will be launching a survey to all associates, specifically focused on Inclusion and Diversity. In early 2021, we joined with CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a coalition of nearly 2,000 CEOs, pledging to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. By signing on to this commitment, we have pledged to take action to cultivate a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected, and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion without retribution.
Workplace, Culture and Career Development
 We are committed to providing our associates an environment where they have an opportunity to provide input on issues affecting the Company’s workforce and the employer-associate relationship. Periodically through the year, we encourage feedback and ideas from our associates through our annual engagement surveys and periodic pulse surveys. Perhaps most importantly, we promote professional and career development and mentorship programs. In 2014, our Associate Engagement & Development Committee implemented the DXLG Mentor Program, which pairs up to 20 mentees with mentors for one-year periods. In April 2016, the DXL Women’s Leadership Group was formed with a mission of “Women supporting, educating and empowering each other @ DXLG”. It started as a pilot program and quickly expanded to now include over 40 female leaders, both people and process managers, in the corporate office and field. In addition, for the past four years, we have presented Leadercast, a platform for leadership development content (held annually in May) and Leadercast Women (held annually in October) as a host site at our corporate headquarters. For the past two years, the programs were made available via an online platform. Our Associate Engagement & Development Committee organizes “Lunch, Learn, Lead” and “Coffee Talk” sessions throughout the year to provide our associates an opportunity to gain insight on a variety of topics, such as, DXL’s social responsibility initiatives, TED talks, Global Sourcing, Normalizing the Brand and Technology. We also have partnered with Marist College to provide our DXL associates and their immediate adult family members a 25% discount toward on-line tuition costs.
Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation programs are designed to pay our associates competitively in the market, based on their skills, qualifications, role, and abilities. Our benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy and help them balance their work and personal lives. These benefits include health and wellness, paid time off, employee assistance, competitive pay, career growth opportunities, paid volunteer time, product discounts, and a culture of recognition. The challenges created by the global pandemic brought mental health awareness to the forefront. We began a program with CALM, an app that provides our home office associates an opportunity to incorporate meditation and other mindfulness activities into their daily routines as well as BurnAlong, a free online health, wellness and fitness platform available to all associates. We also provide an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which provides 24/7 assistance to associates and their family members for a variety of issues such as stress, family, parenting, finances.
