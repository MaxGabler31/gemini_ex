Item 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
IEC Electronics Corp. (“IEC,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company”) conducts business directly, as well as through its subsidiaries, IEC Electronics Corp-Albuquerque (“Albuquerque”), IEC Analysis & Testing Laboratory, LLC (“ATL”) and IEC California Holdings, Inc., which was dissolved as of September 18, 2019. Our Rochester unit operates as a division of IEC. 
We are a premier provider of electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) to advanced technology companies that produce life-saving and mission critical products for the medical, industrial, aerospace and defense sectors. We specialize in delivering technical solutions for the custom manufacturing, product configuration, and verification testing of highly engineered complex products that require a sophisticated level of manufacturing to ensure quality and performance. 
Within the EMS sector, we have unique capabilities which allow our customers to rely on us to solve their complex challenges, minimize their supply chain risk and deliver full system solutions for their supply chain. These capabilities include, among others:

• | Our engineering services include the design, development, and fabrication of customized stress testing platforms to simulate a product’s end application, such as thermal cycling and vibration, in order to ensure reliable performance and avoid catastrophic failure when the product is placed in service.


• | Our vertical manufacturing model offers customers the ability to simplify their supply chain by utilizing a single supplier for their critical components including complex printed circuit board assembly (“PCBA”), precision metalworking, and interconnect solutions. This service model allows us to control the cost, lead time, and quality of these critical components which are then integrated into full system assemblies and minimizes our customers’ supply chain risk. 


• | We provide direct order fulfillment services for our customers by integrating with their configuration management process to obtain their customer orders, customize the product to the specific requirements, functionally test the product and provide verification data, and direct ship to their end customer in order to reduce time, cost, and complexity within our customer’s supply chain.


• | We believe we are the only EMS provider with an on-site laboratory that has been approved by the Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) for their Qualified Testing Supplier List (“QTSL”) program which deems the site suitable to conduct various QTSL and military testing standards including counterfeit component analysis and environmental testing to qualify a part fit for use. In addition, this advanced laboratory is utilized for complex design analysis and manufacturing process development to solve challenges and accelerate our customers’ time to market. 

We are a 100% U.S. manufacturer which attracts customers who are unlikely to utilize offshore suppliers due to the proprietary nature of their products, governmental restrictions or volume considerations. Our locations include:

• | Newark, New York - Located approximately one hour east of Rochester, New York, our Newark location is our corporate headquarters and is our largest manufacturing location providing complex circuit board manufacturing, interconnect solutions, and system-level assemblies along with an on-site material analysis laboratory for advanced manufacturing process development.


• | Rochester, New York - Focuses on precision metalworking services including complex metal chassis and assemblies.


• | Albuquerque, New Mexico - Specializes in the aerospace and defense markets with complex circuit board and system-level assemblies along with a state of the art analysis and testing laboratory which conducts root cause failure analysis, reliability, inspection and authenticity testing.

We excel at complex, highly engineered products that require sophisticated manufacturing support where quality and reliability are of paramount importance. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we have created a high-intensity, rapid response culture capable of reacting and adapting to their ever-changing needs.  Our customer-centric approach offers a high degree of flexibility while simultaneously complying with rigorous quality and on-time delivery standards.
We proactively invest in areas we view as important for our continued long-term growth. All of our locations are ISO 9001:2008 certified and ITAR registered. We are Nadcap accredited and AS9100D certified at our Newark and Albuquerque locations to support the stringent quality requirements of the aerospace industry. Our Newark location is ISO 13485 certified to serve the medical sector and is an approved supplier by the National Security Agency (“NSA”) under the COMSEC standard regarding communications security. Our analysis and testing laboratory in Albuquerque is ISO 17025 accredited, an IPC-approved Validation Services test Laboratory, and we believe is the only on-site EMS laboratory that has been approved by the DLA for their QTSL program which deems the site suitable to conduct various QTSL and military testing standards including

counterfeit component analysis and environmental testing to qualify a part fit for use. Albuquerque also performs work per NASA-STD-8739 and J-STD-001ES space standards.
The technical expertise of our experienced workforce enables us to build some of the most advanced electronic, wire and cable, interconnect solutions, and precision metal systems sought by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”).
Organization
IEC Electronics Corp., a Delaware corporation, is the successor by merger in 1990 to IEC Electronics Corp., a New York corporation, which was originally organized in 1966. Our executive offices are located at 105 Norton Street, Newark, New York 14513. Our telephone number is 315-331-7742, and our Internet address is www.iec-electronics.com.
We have executed several strategic acquisitions over the past decade to advance our capability to support existing and potential customers in the EMS market.
The Electronics Contract Manufacturing Services Industry
The EMS industry specializes in providing the program management, technical support and manufacturing expertise required to take a product from the early design and prototype stages through volume production and distribution. Primarily as a response to rapid technological change and increased competition in the electronics industry, OEMs have recognized that by utilizing EMS providers they can improve their competitive position, realize an improved return on investment and concentrate on their core competencies such as research, product design and development and marketing. In addition, EMS providers allow OEMs to bring new products to market more rapidly and to adjust more quickly to fluctuations in product demand; avoid additional investment in plant, equipment and personnel; reduce inventory and other overhead costs; and determine known unit costs over the life of a contract. Many OEMs now consider EMS providers valued partners in executing their business and manufacturing strategy.
OEMs increasingly require EMS providers to provide complete turn-key manufacturing and material handling services rather than working on a consignment basis in which the OEM supplies all materials and the EMS provider supplies labor. Turn-key contracts involve design, manufacturing and engineering support, the procurement of all materials, sophisticated in-circuit and functional testing, and distribution.
IEC’s Strategy
IEC is focused on providing services for life-saving and mission critical products in the medical, industrial, aerospace and defense sectors that require a sophisticated level of manufacturing support. We offer our customers a full range of manufacturing services, combined with advanced scientific technical support to ensure their products perform for the critical applications for which they are intended. The ability to solve our customers’ technical challenges, meet their stringent quality requirements, and integrate seamlessly within their supply chain, is the value add that IEC brings. 
We often engage with our customers in the early stages of product or program design, work with customers to evaluate the manufacturability and testability of their products, with the objective of enhancing quality and reducing the overall cost of ownership for our customers. Due to the highly regulated environment for many of our customers, they are seeking a long-term partnership throughout the life-cycle of their product. 
We are a certified small business with advanced technical capabilities. This allows us to focus on our customer’s needs and deliver solutions in a responsive manner to accelerate their time to market. 
Competition
The EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the EMS market include: technology capabilities, quality and range of services, past performance, design, cost, responsiveness and flexibility. We specialize in the custom manufacture of life-saving and mission critical products that require complex circuit boards and system-level assemblies; a wide array of cable and wire harness assemblies capable of withstanding extreme environments; and precision metal components. 
We are certified to serve the military and commercial aerospace sector as well as the medical sector and we hold various accreditations. We believe we excel where quality and reliability are of paramount importance and when low-to-medium volume, high-mix production is the norm. We utilize state-of-the-art, automated circuit board assembly equipment together with a full complement of high-reliability manufacturing stress testing methods. Our customer-centric approach offers a high degree of flexibility while simultaneously complying with rigorous quality and on-time delivery standards.

We compete against numerous foreign and domestic companies in addition to the internal capabilities of some of our customers. Some of our competitors include Sparton Corporation, Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Plexus Corp. and Ducommun Incorporated. We may face new competitors in the future as the outsourcing industry evolves and existing or start-up companies develop capabilities similar to ours.
Products and Services
We manufacture a wide range of assemblies that are incorporated into many different products, such as aerospace and defense systems, medical devices, industrial equipment and transportation products. Our products are distributed to and through OEMs. We support multiple divisions and product lines for many of our customers and frequently manufacture successive generations of products. In some cases, we are the sole EMS contract manufacturer for the customer site or division.
Materials Management
We generally procure materials to meet specific contract requirements and are often protected by contract terms that call for reimbursement to us in the event a contract is terminated by the customer. Whether purchased by us or supplied by a customer, materials are tracked and controlled by our internal systems throughout the manufacturing process.
Availability of Components
Our revenues are principally derived from turn-key services that involve the acquisition of raw and component materials, often from a limited number of suppliers, to be manufactured in accordance with each customer’s specifications. While we believe we are well positioned with supplier relationships and procurement expertise, potential shortages of components in the world market could have a material adverse effect on our revenue levels or operating efficiencies.
Suppliers
Although we depend on a limited number of key suppliers, as a result of strategic relationships we have established with them, the Company frequently benefits from one or more of the following enhancements: reduced lead-times; competitive pricing; favorable payment terms; and preference during periods of limited supply. We have preferred supplier partnership agreements in place to support our business generally and to ensure access to custom commodities, such as printed circuit boards.
For the year ended September 30, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), IEC obtained 23% of the materials used in production from two vendors, Avnet, Inc. and Arrow Electronics Inc. If either of these vendors were to cease supplying us with materials for any reason, we would be forced to find alternative sources of supply. A change in suppliers could cause a delay in availability of products and a possible loss of sales, which could adversely affect operating results.
Marketing and Sales
We utilize a direct sales force as well as a nationwide network of manufacturer’s representatives. Through this hybrid sales approach, we execute a focused sales strategy targeting those customers whose product profiles are aligned with our core areas of expertise. For example, we focus on customers that are developing complex, advanced technology products for a wide array of market sectors ranging from satellite communications to medical, military and ruggedized industrial products.
Typically, the demand profiles associated with these customers are in the low-to-moderate volume range with high variability in required quantities and product mix. These customers’ products often employ emerging technologies that require concentrated engineering and manufacturing support from product development through prototyping and on to volume manufacturing, which can result in significant lead times before full production and are difficult to forecast. As a result of the specialized services required, such customers rarely rely on an outsourcing model that focuses primarily on minimizing costs.

To reduce risk, the Company seeks a balanced distribution of business across industry sectors. As indicated in the table that follows, this can fluctuate based on end customer demands.

 | Years Ended 
Percent of Sales by Sector | September 30, 2019 | September 30, 2018
Aerospace and Defense | 60% | 57% 
Medical | 22% | 23% 
Industrial | 18% | 20% 
 | 100% | 100% 

One individual customer in the aerospace and defense sector, ViaSat Inc., at 23% represented 10% or more of sales in fiscal 2019. In the year ended September 30, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”), two customers represented 10% or more of sales, ViaSat, Inc. in the aerospace and defense sector represented 23% and Baxter in the medical sector represented 11%. 
Two customers represented 10% or more of receivables at September 30, 2019. Both customers are in the aerospace and defense sector, and together accounted for 38% of the outstanding balances at September 30, 2019. Three customers represented 10% or more of receivables at September 30, 2018. One customer each in the aerospace and defense sector, medical sector, and industrial sector together accounted for 55% of the outstanding balances at September 30, 2018.
Backlog
Our backlog at the end of fiscal 2019 was $212.0 million, which is 58.6% higher than $133.7 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Backlog consists of two categories: purchase orders and firm forecasted commitments. In addition to fulfilling orders and commitments contained in quarter-end backlog reports, we also receive and ship orders within each quarter that do not appear in the period end backlog reports. Variations in the magnitude and duration of contracts as well as customer delivery requirements may result in fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Approximately $151.3 million of our backlog at September 30, 2019 is expected to be shipped within the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), with the remainder expected to ship in future years. This compares to $122.3 million that was expected to be shipped within 12 months from year-end as of September 30, 2018, with the remainder at such time that was expected to be shipped greater than 12 months from the prior year-end. 
Governmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to certain United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental protection, waste management, and employee health and safety matters. We believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and governmental regulations. While current costs of compliance, including compliance with environmental laws, are not material, our expenses could increase if new laws, regulations or requirements were to be introduced. Some of our medical and other customers are highly regulated. Any failure to comply by customers, related to products we produce for them, can delay or disrupt their orders from us.
Employees
Employees are our single greatest resource. IEC’s total employees numbered 840, all of which are full time employees, at September 30, 2019. The Company added 151 employees during fiscal 2019, mainly driven by higher volumes in fiscal 2019. Some of our full-time employees are temporary employees. We make a concerted effort to engage our employees in initiatives that improve our business and provide opportunities for growth, and we believe that our employee relations are good. We have access to large and technically qualified workforces in close proximity to our operating locations in Rochester, NY and Albuquerque, NM.
Expansion of Newark, New York Manufacturing Operations
In February 2018, we announced that we will open a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Newark, NY funded in part by the State of New York. The new 150,000 square foot facility will be located at the Silver Hill Technology Park and allows us to design, from the ground up, a state-of-the-art, advanced technology facility to support our operations. As part of this expansion, we intend to move our administrative offices to this location.
