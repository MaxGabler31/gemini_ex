 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General 
GameStop Corp. (“GameStop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) offers games and entertainment products through its ecommerce properties and stores. 
Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal year 2021 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 29, 2022 ("fiscal 2021"). Fiscal year 2020 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on January 30, 2021 ("fiscal 2020") and fiscal year 2019 consisted of the 52 weeks ended on February 1, 2020 ("fiscal 2019"). 
Reportable Segments
We operate in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. We identified segments based on a combination of geographic areas, which is the basis of how we manage the organization and analyze performance. Our sales and profits are driven through both our physical stores and broad ecommerce platforms. Each segment consists primarily of retail operations, with the significant majority of our stores and ecommerce properties focused on games, entertainment products and technology. These products are substantially the same regardless of geographic location, with the primary differences in merchandise carried being the timing of the release of new products or technologies in the various segments.
As of January 29, 2022, we had a total of 4,573 stores across all of our segments; 3,018 in the United States, 231 in Canada, 417 in Australia and 907 in Europe. Our stores and ecommerce sites operate primarily under the names GameStop® (“GameStop”), EB Games® (“EB Games”) and MicromaniaTM.
Our segments also include 50 pop culture themed stores selling collectibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys and other retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers in international markets operating under the Zing Pop Culture® brand. Our brands also include Game Informer® (“Game Informer”) magazine, the world's leading print and digital gaming publication.
Financial information about our segments is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, "Segment Information," of this Form 10-K.
Merchandise
We categorize our sale of products as follows:
•Hardware and accessories. We offer new and pre-owned gaming platforms from the major console and PC manufacturers. The current generation of consoles include the Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X, and the Nintendo Switch. Accessories consist primarily of controllers, gaming headsets, virtual reality products and memory cards.
•Software. We offer new and pre-owned gaming software for current and certain prior generation consoles. We also sell a wide variety of in-game digital currency, digital downloadable content (“DLC”) and full-game downloads.
•Collectibles. Collectibles consist of licensed merchandise, primarily related to the gaming, television and movie industries and pop-culture themes.
Trade-In Program
We provide our customers with an opportunity to trade-in their pre-owned gaming, mobility and other products at our stores in exchange for cash or in-store credit which can be applied towards the purchase of other products. This process drives higher market share and offers a broader range of price points for our customers. Our trade-in program provides customers a means to unlock value and recycle used product, which enables us to offer previous generation platforms and related games. We operate refurbishment centers in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, where used gaming, mobility, and other products can be tested, repaired, sanitized, repackaged and redistributed for sale.
Store Locations
Our retail stores are generally located in strip centers, shopping malls and pedestrian areas. These locations provide easy access and high frequency of visits and, in the case of strip centers and high-traffic pedestrian stores, high visibility. We target strip centers that are conveniently located, have a mass merchant or supermarket anchor tenant and have a high volume of customers. As of January 29, 2022, we offered games and entertainment products in 4,573 stores worldwide.

Business Strategy
GameStop is on a strategic path to fully leverage our unique position and brand in gaming. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business while at the same time, pursuing strategic initiatives to transform GameStop for the future by expanding our addressable market and product offerings to drive growth in the gaming and entertainment industries.
GameStop is focused on transforming into a customer-obsessed technology company to delight gamers and is actively focused on the below: 
•Establish ecommerce excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment across all channels and will scale up our ecommerce operations to make the most convenient solution for our customers. This includes app & site redesigns, improvements in fulfillment and delivery times, better product availability across all channels, and a further improved customer service experience.
•Expand our selection to deliver a market-leading offering in gaming & entertainment. Continue investing in expanding our product offering to relevant categories for our customers, including becoming a leader in PC gaming, virtual reality, and other gaming products.
•Leverage existing strengths and assets. Grow our presence in the gaming community and increase market share through enhancing the value of our loyalty program and Game Informer assets while also expanding the scope of our buy, sell, and trade business to support our expanded offering.
•Invest in new growth opportunities. As we scale and expand our core offerings we will simultaneously invest in additional growth, including blockchain, digital assets (including non-fungible tokens ("NFTs")), Web 3.0 technology, and new destination formats for our stores. In January 2022, we entered into partnerships with Immutable X Pty Limited (“IMX”) and Digital Worlds NFTs Ltd. ("Digital Worlds") pursuant to which IMX will become a technology partner and platform for our NFT marketplace, and Digital Worlds will grant up to $100 million in IMX tokens to creators of NFT content and technology. In addition, Digital Worlds agreed to provide up to approximately $150 million in IMX tokens to GameStop upon the achievement of certain milestones.
We believe these future transformation efforts are an important aspect of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders.
In fiscal 2021 we further strengthened our balance sheet by eliminating $314.6 million of total outstanding debt as of fiscal 2020 and raising $1,672.8 million in gross equity capital through an at-the-market offering. Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and may continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See "Consolidated Results of Operations—Selling, General and Administrative Expenses" for additional information.
PowerUp Rewards
Our U.S. loyalty program, called PowerUp Rewards® ("PowerUp Rewards"), had approximately 50.5 million members as of January 29, 2022, of which approximately 16.1 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop® in the past year. The PowerUp Rewards membership totals include 5.8 million paying pro members, which represents 31.8% growth compared to prior year. Our loyalty programs generally offer our customers the ability to sign up for a free or paid membership which gives our customers access to exclusive gaming related rewards. The programs' paid memberships generally include a subscription to Game Informer® magazine and additional discounts and benefits in our stores and ecommerce properties. The GameStop PowerUp Rewards program has also been recognized by Newsweek® as one of America’s Best Loyalty Programs 2022.
Game Informer®
We publish Game Informer®, a leading gaming publication featuring reviews of new releases, previews of the big titles on the horizon, and coverage of the latest developments in the gaming industry. The magazine is available by subscription, in both digital and physical formats and is sold both online and in-store. Game Informer® is a part of the PowerUp Rewards Pro loyalty program and is a key feature of each paid PowerUp Rewards Pro membership. Operating results from the English version of Game Informer® are included in the United States segment and other international version results from Game Informer® operations are included in the segment in which the sales are generated. 
Vendors
We purchase our new products worldwide from a broad number of manufacturers, software publishers and distributors. Our largest vendors are Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, U&I Entertainment and Electronic Arts, which collectively accounted for a majority of our new product purchases in fiscal 2021. We have established price protections and return rights with our primary gaming product vendors in order to reduce our risk of inventory obsolescence. 
In addition, we generally conduct business on an order-by-order basis, a practice that is typical throughout the industry. We purchase collectibles merchandise from a broad base of domestic and international vendors. We believe that maintaining and strengthening our long-term relationships with our vendors is essential to our operations and continued expansion.
Distribution and Information Management
Our operating strategy involves providing a broad merchandise selection for our customers to purchase what they want, when and how they want it. We use our distribution facilities, store locations and inventory management systems to optimize the efficiency of the flow of products to our stores and customers, enhance fulfillment efficiency and optimize in-stock and overall investment in inventory. In 2020, we introduced same day delivery service in certain markets to enhance the customer shopping and delivery experience. In 2021, we announced the expansion of our North American fulfillment network through the lease of facilities in Reno, Nevada and York, Pennsylvania. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Operational Risks - “We depend on third-party delivery services to deliver products to our retail locations, fulfillment centers and customers on a timely and consistent basis, and changes in the terms we have with these service providers could adversely affect our business and financial position.”
Competition
The gaming industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other gaming and related specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; the online environments operated by Sony (PlayStation Network), Microsoft (XBox Live), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch Online), as well as other online retailers and game rental companies. Gaming products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value gaming products and other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.
In the U.S., we compete with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”); Target Corporation (“Target”); Best Buy Co., Inc. ("Best Buy") and Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon.com”), among others. Throughout Europe we compete with major consumer electronics retailers such as Media Markt, Saturn and FNAC, major hypermarket chains like Carrefour and Auchan, and online retailer Amazon.com. Competitors in Canada include Wal-Mart and Best Buy. In Australia, competitors include JB HiFi stores, Big W, Target, and Amazon.com. Globally, we also compete with certain vendors including Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, among others, for direct-to-consumer offerings.
Market Size
Based upon estimates compiled by various market research firms, including NPD Group, Inc. ("NPD"), International Development Group ("IDG") and DFC Intelligence ("DFC"), we estimate that the market for new physical console gaming systems, accessories and physical software was approximately $18.0 billion in 2021 in the countries in which we operate. This estimated market excludes sales of pre-owned gaming systems, which are not currently measured by any third-party research firms. Additionally, based on estimates compiled by DFC, we estimate that the market in North America for content in digital format (full-game and add-on content downloads for console and PC, subscriptions, mobile games and social network games) was approximately $27.0 billion in 2021.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of our sales and operating profit realized during the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we generated approximately 37% and 42%, respectively, of our sales during the fourth quarter.
Trademarks 
We have a number of trademarks and service marks, including “GameStop®,” “Game Informer®,” “EB Games®,” “Electronics Boutique®,” “Zing Pop Culture®,” “Power to the Players®” and “GameStop PowerUp Rewards®,” which have been registered by us with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For many of our trademarks and service marks, including “MicromaniaTM,” we also have registered or have registrations pending with the trademark authorities throughout the world. We maintain a policy of pursuing registration of our principal marks and opposing any infringement of our marks.
Human Capital
At GameStop, we strive to attract, retain and develop talent at all levels of our organization. In 2021, as part of these efforts to attract talent throughout the United States, we opened additional offices in Seattle, WA, Pembrook Pines, FL, and Boston, MA. We have approximately 12,000 full-time salaried and hourly associates and between 14,000 and 28,000 part-time hourly associates worldwide, depending on the time of year. The number of part-time hourly associates fluctuates primarily due to the seasonality of our business.
•Development. We are committed to providing our associates with opportunities to develop and grow their careers. We offer learning opportunities through our proprietary training programs and high-potential talent development programs as well as educational assistance programs. 
•Diversity and Inclusion. We advocate working actively to build understanding and collaboration across functions. We believe a more diverse workforce provides many benefits in drawing upon a greater richness of resources, experiences, ideas and talents. 
•Benefits. We have designed our compensation and benefits programs to meet the unique needs of employees in our various business segments. These programs are intended to attract, reward and retain talent that reflects local communities and customers, while instilling an ownership mentality in our work.
We are also committed to taking care of our associates in times of need. Through our Gamer Fund employee assistance program, an employee sponsored 501(c)(3) organization, we have provided temporary assistance to more than 3,800 GameStop associates who have experienced unforeseen emergency or hardship, and more than $750,000 in scholarships.
•Safety. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented enhanced safety measures and made certain other operational changes that were in the best interests of our associates as well as the communities in which we operate, including use of personal protective equipment. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates as we navigate the issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Sustainability
We are committed to sustainability and to operating our business in a manner that results in a positive impact to the environment and our communities. Through our trade-in program, we take gaming consoles, gaming software and consumer electronics that are otherwise destined for landfills and either refurbish them or recycle them. In 2021 alone, through our U.S. refurbishment center, we refurbished over 0.7 million pieces of software (CDs) and over 2.1 million consumer electronic devices, and recycled over 1.0 million pounds of e-waste. In addition, we continuously measure and look for cost effective ways to reduce our carbon emissions and have seen both our total emissions and emissions by store decrease in the U.S. over our baseline year of 2009. In 2021, we achieved an 11% reduction in year over year carbon emissions in the U.S. through both operational reductions and renewable sourcing.
