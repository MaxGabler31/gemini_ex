 c. Narrative Description of Business 
 (i) General 
 We are one of the leading processors and distributors of tree nuts and peanuts in the United States. We manufacture and market the Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brand names and manufacture and distribute numerous private brands as well. Through a deliberate strategy of focused capital expenditures and complementary acquisitions, we have built a generally vertically integrated nut processing operation that enables us to control almost every step of the process for pecans, peanuts and walnuts, including procurement from growers, shelling, processing, packaging and marketing. Vertical integration allows us to enhance product quality and, in most crop years, purchase inshell pecans, peanuts and walnuts from growers at lower costs as opposed to purchasing these nut meats from other shellers. We believe that our business model typically works to our advantage in terms of cost savings and provides us with better insight into crop development. 
 Our brands are some of the most well-recognized in the packaged food industry. In recent years we have developed Fisher recipe nuts as the leading brand in the category through strong marketing campaigns, merchandising, and promotional support. We have increased distribution and launched innovation with our Orchard Valley Harvest and Fisher snack nut brands in many retailers. We have also expanded into new channels and business models with Southern Style Nuts and Squirrel Brand. Our branded and private brand products are sold through the major distribution channels to significant buyers of nuts, including food and other retailers (both brick and mortar and e-commerce), commercial ingredient users and contract packaging customers. Selling through multiple distribution channels allows us to generate multiple revenue opportunities for the nuts we process. For example, pecan halves could be sold to food retailers under our Fisher brand, and pecan pieces could be sold to commercial ingredient users. We process and sell all major nut types consumed in the United States, including peanuts, pecans, cashews, walnuts and almonds (our major nut types) in a wide variety of innovative packaging, thus offering our customers a complete nut product offering.

  (ii) Principal Products 
 Our principal products are raw and processed nuts. Including trail and snack mixes, these products accounted for approximately 94%, 95% and 95% of our gross sales for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. The nut product line includes almonds, pecans, peanuts, black walnuts, English walnuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, pistachios, pine nuts, Brazil nuts and filberts. Our nut products are sold in numerous package styles and sizes, and we offer our nut products in a variety of different styles and seasonings. We sell our products domestically to retailers and wholesalers as well as to commercial ingredient and contract packaging customers. For more information about our revenues in our various distribution channels, see Part II, Item 8 — “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. 
 We acquire all of our peanuts and walnuts directly from domestic growers. The majority of our pecans are acquired from domestic growers with the remainder acquired from growers in Mexico. We purchase the balance of our raw nuts from importers, trading companies and domestic processors. 
 Furthermore, we manufacture and market peanut butter in several sizes and varieties. We also market and distribute, and in many cases process and manufacture, a wide assortment of other food and snack products. These other products include snack mixes, salad toppings, snacks, snack bites, trail mixes, dried fruit and chocolate and yogurt coated products sold to retailers and wholesalers; baking ingredients sold to retailers, wholesalers and commercial ingredient customers; bulk food products sold to commercial ingredient users; an assortment of sunflower kernels, pepitas, snack mixes, almond butter, cashew butter, candy and confections, corn snacks, chickpea snacks, sesame sticks and other sesame snack products sold to retail supermarkets, mass merchandisers and commercial ingredient users and a wide variety of toppings for ice cream and yogurt sold to commercial ingredient users. 
 (iii) Customers and Channels 
 We sell our products to approximately 265 customers through the consumer, commercial ingredient and contract packaging distribution channels. The consumer channel supplies nut-based products, including consumer-packaged products, to retailers including supermarket chains, wholesalers, supercenters, internet retailers and other retail outlets, across the United States. We sell products through the consumer channel under our brand names, including the Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brands, as well as under our customers’ private brands. The commercial ingredient channel supplies nut-based products to other manufacturers to use as ingredients in their final food products such as bakery, confection, cereal and ice cream, and produces nut-based products that are customized to the specifications of chefs, national restaurant chains, foodservice distributors, fast food chains, institutions and hotel kitchens. We sell products through the commercial ingredient channel under our Fisher brand and our customers’ private brands. Our contract packaging channel produces and packages nut and fruit-based snacks for other food manufacturers under their brand name. 
 We are dependent on a few significant customers for a majority of our total net sales, particularly in the consumer channel. Net sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for approximately 35% of our net sales for fiscal 2022, 34% of our net sales for fiscal 2021 and 33% of our net sales for fiscal 2020. Net sales to Target Corporation accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and 12% of our net sales for fiscal 2020. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for any period presented. 
 (iv) Sales and Distribution 
 We market our products through our own sales department and through a network of approximately 70 independent brokers and various independent distributors and suppliers, including group purchasing organizations. 
 We distribute products from each of our principal facilities. The majority of our products are shipped from our facilities by contract and common carriers. 
 We operate a retail store at our Elgin headquarters. This store sells Fisher snack and baking products, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nut products, bulk foods and other products produced by us and other vendors directly to consumers.

  (v) Marketing 
 Marketing strategies are developed for each distribution channel and focus primarily on branded products. Branded consumer efforts concentrate on building brand awareness, developing, identifying and introducing new products, attracting new customers, increasing distribution and increasing consumption in the snack nut, recipe nut and produce categories. Private brand and commercial ingredient channel efforts are focused on category management, new product identification and introduction, brand awareness and merchandising support. 
 A significant portion of our branded marketing efforts are focused on compelling consumer campaigns that include advertisements (e.g., online video, social and influencer activations and partnerships, search engine marketing and media partnerships), product sampling and coupon offers. Our integrated marketing efforts for the Fisher brand include partnerships with chefs and influencers, as well as professional baseball sponsorships. Additionally, shipper display units and other point of sale promotions are utilized in retail stores in an effort to gain additional temporary product placement and to drive sales volume. We work with third-party information agencies, such as Information Resources, Inc. (“IRi”), to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing and measure product growth, particularly in comparison to our competition and the product category. 
 Commercial ingredient trade promotion typically includes periodically attending regional and national trade shows, trade publication advertising and one-on-one marketing. These promotional efforts highlight our processing capabilities, broad product portfolio, product customization and packaging innovation. 
 Through participation in several trade associations, funding of industry research and sponsorship of educational programs, we support efforts to increase awareness of the health benefits, convenience and versatility of nuts as both a snack and a recipe ingredient among existing and future consumers of nuts. In the future, we expect to increase our participation and funding with trade associations and groups to focus on sustainability efforts while continuing to partner with farmers to further mitigate climate risk. 
 (vi) Competition 
 Our nuts and other snack food products compete against products manufactured and sold by numerous other companies in the snack food industry, some of whom are substantially larger and have greater resources than us. In the nut industry, we compete with, among others, Hormel Foods Corp. (Planters brand) and numerous regional snack food processors. We also compete with the Diamond brand, among others. Competitive factors in our markets include price, product quality, customer service, breadth of product line, brand name awareness, method of distribution, sales promotion, category management, service level compliance and innovation. The combination of our generally vertically integrated operating model with respect to pecans, peanuts and walnuts, our product quality, product offering, brand strength, innovation, distribution model and our focus on nut and nut related products generally enable us to compete in each of these categories, but there can be no guarantee that our products will continue to be competitive with many of our larger competitors. See Part I, Item 1A — “Risk Factors”. 
 (vii) Raw Materials and Supplies 
 We purchase nuts from domestic and foreign sources. In fiscal 2022, all of our walnuts, almonds and peanuts were purchased from domestic sources. We purchase our pecans from the southern United States and Mexico. Cashew nuts are imported from Vietnam and certain West African countries. For fiscal 2022, approximately 32% of the dollar value of our total nut purchases was from foreign sources. 
 Competition in the nut shelling industry is driven by shellers’ ability to access and purchase raw nuts, to shell the nuts efficiently and to sell the nuts to processors. We shell all major domestic nut types, with the exception of almonds, and are among a few select shellers who further process, package and sell nuts to the end-user. Raw material pricing pressure and the high cost of equipment automation have previously contributed to a consolidation among shellers across all nut types, especially peanuts and pecans. 
 We are generally vertically integrated with respect to pecans, peanuts and walnuts and, unlike our major consumer distribution channel competitors who purchase nuts on the open market, we purchase a substantial portion of our pecans, peanuts and walnuts directly from growers. 
 Due, in part, to the seasonal nature of the industry, we maintain significant inventories of peanuts, pecans and walnuts at certain times of the year, especially in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, we increased our inventories to reflect supply chain constraints to help ensure we have product available for our customers. Fluctuations in the market price of pecans, peanuts and walnuts and other nuts may affect the value of our inventory and thus may also affect our gross profit and gross profit margin. See Part I, Item 1A — “Risk Factors”.

  We purchase other inventory items such as roasting oils, seasonings, plastic jars, labels, stand-up bags, composite and clear-plastic cans and other packaging materials from other third parties. Material costs, including tree nuts, peanuts, other commodities, packaging and other edible ingredients represented approximately 79% of our total cost of sales for fiscal 2022. 
 (viii) Trademarks and Patents 
 We market our products primarily under name brands, including the Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts brand names. Fisher, Orchard Valley Harvest, Squirrel Brand and Southern Style Nuts are registered as trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as in various other foreign jurisdictions. We do not own any trademarks for any private brands, which are owned by the respective private brand customer. Our trademarks are important as they provide our customers with information about the quality of our products. However, registration and use of our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to certain risks in addition to other risks generally related to our intellectual property. See Part I, Item 1A — “Risk Factors”. We also own several patents of various durations. We expect to continue to renew for the foreseeable future those trademarks that are important to our business and expand registration of our trademarks into new jurisdictions. We intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously. 
 (ix) Human Capital 
 As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,300 full-time employees across our four locations. 
 We recognize that, in order for our company to be successful, our employees must be healthy, well-trained and motivated to do their best every day. We are thus relentlessly focused on attracting, retaining and managing our employees. The key aspects of our human resources program and objectives are as follows: 
 Health and Safety: As a producer, manufacturer and processer of nuts and nut-related products, we are subject to extensive food and employee safety laws and regulations. We place a high priority on employee health and safety as part of our continuous improvement culture. Our total occupational injury rate continues to remain in line with the food manufacturing industry average. We continue to enhance our safety programs by investing in systems and controls focused on injury and accident prevention. During fiscal 2022, we utilized our cloud-based environmental health and safety platform to analyze safety observations which helped us to predict and prevent future safety risks. We believe properly prioritizing risks helps us to be proactive in building a sustainable safety culture. 
 COVID-19: The COVID-19 pandemic is still a factor. In 2020, we instituted a COVID-19 task force to help oversee and promote the health and safety of our employees. The COVID-19 task force continued to function during fiscal 2022. The health and safety protocols are still active and working to protect our employees. We will continue to regularly monitor such protocols for best practices and improvements. The COVID-19 task force will continue to meet until we have received guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, federal, state and local governments or any other health authorities that COVID-19 is no longer a concern. The health and safety of our employees will always remain a priority. 
 Diversity and Inclusion: We recognize that our business is stronger and more successful if supported by a diverse workforce. Our goal is to maintain and promote diversity among our employees and foster an inclusive environment where differences are celebrated. In fiscal 2021, we launched our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, consisting of a team of employees from different functional areas, to provide oversight and enhance our diversity and inclusion initiatives. In fiscal 2022 year our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion council organized various events facilitated through our Employee Resource Groups and built a three-year strategic plan. 
 Training, Development and Promotion: We believe that training, developing, and promoting our employees is an important part of our vibrant employee culture. These measures enhance our performance and are an important component of employee satisfaction. We offer training to our employees on a variety of subjects related to professional development, workplace fundamentals, business, computer applications and industry specific subjects such as our Nutology-101 courses. In fiscal 2022 we piloted a formal Leadership Development program with 41 participants. Through the course of the program approximately 36% of program participants were able to expand their responsibilities and move into higher level jobs with the company. We also conduct annual mandatory training for all employees covering food safety, workplace safety and various regulatory and compliance related subjects. In fiscal 2022, approximately 16% of our employees received promotions and a promotion-related salary increase. 
 
4 

  Employee Rewards and Satisfaction: Through our Sanfilippo Value Added (SVA) and Total Team Performance (TTP) incentive programs, we provide annual cash bonus opportunities to motivate and reward our employees and align their interests with those of our stockholders. Employees participate in the SVA or TTP program, not both. Approximately 20% of our employees participate in the SVA program and approximately 80% participate in the TTP program. In addition to the SVA and TTP incentive programs, we offer annual sales incentives to our sales and marketing employees and annual monetary leadership awards to our top performers across all functions. We are also proud to offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits package designed to meet the diverse needs of our employees at every stage of life, including a company-sponsored healthcare program and 401(k) program with a generous company matching contribution. In fiscal 2022 we introduced adoption assistance, student loan repayment, paid parental leaves, volunteer time off and enhanced time off programs. We continue to closely monitor the competitiveness of our compensation programs. In fiscal 2022 more than 38% of our employees received market-based wage adjustments. Among other things, we periodically conduct employee surveys to monitor employee satisfaction, engagement and concerns. 
 Codes of Conduct; Oversight of Concerns: We maintain codes of conduct and ethics policies designed to promote ethical conduct of our employees and agents and have implemented a robust program to address employee concerns and complaints, which includes an anonymous incident reporting system, periodic employee surveys and suggestion boxes that can result in monetary awards. Our employees are made aware of such reporting system through various communication methods, including assurances against retaliation. We regularly monitor best practices in this area to ensure our policies and practices are updated as appropriate. 
 (x) Seasonality 
 Our business is seasonal. Demand for peanut and tree nut products is highest during the last four months of the calendar year. Peanuts, pecans and walnuts, three of our principal raw materials, are primarily purchased between September and February and are processed throughout the year until the following harvest. As a result of this seasonality, our personnel requirements rise during the second quarter of our fiscal year. Our working capital requirements generally peak during the third quarter of our fiscal year. 
 (xi) Government Regulations, Operating Hazards and Uninsured Risks 
 The sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of shell fragments, foreign objects, insects, foreign substances, pathogens, chemicals, mycotoxins and other hazards, agents or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. We (i) maintain what we believe to be rigid quality control standards and food safety systems that is evident in our annual Safe Quality Food (“SQF”) certification at each manufacturing facility, (ii) generally inspect our nut and other food products by visual examination, screening, metal detectors or electronic monitors at various stages of our shelling and processing operations, (iii) work with the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in its inspection of peanuts shipped to and from our peanut shelling facilities, (iv) maintain robust environmental pathogen programs, (v) seek to comply with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act by labeling each product that we sell with labels that disclose the nutritional value and content of each of our products and (vi) assure compliance with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) through our comprehensive Food Safety Plans which include following Current Good Manufacturing Practices and control biological, chemical and physical hazards through our Process, Sanitation, Allergen and Supply Chain Preventative Controls; however, no assurance can be given that some nut or other food products sold by us may not contain or develop harmful substances. In order to mitigate this risk, we strive to select high-quality nut suppliers and currently maintain product liability and contaminated product insurance at amounts we believe are adequate in light of our operations. A portion of our annual capital expenditure budget is allocated for compliance with government-mandated food safety standards. Compliance with food safety standards and other government regulations may have an impact on our operations and earnings, particularly if we fail to satisfy such standards or regulations and our products are recalled, harm our consumers or harm our Company’s reputation and standing as a leader of branded and private brand nut and snack products. See Part I, Item 1A — “Risk Factors”.
