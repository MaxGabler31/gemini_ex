Item 1. Business 
Overview
Udemy is a two-sided marketplace where our instructors develop content to meet learner demand. Courses can be accessed through our direct-to-consumer or UB offerings. Courses on both offerings address learning objectives such as reskilling or upskilling in technology and business, enhancing soft skills, and personal development. We analyze data gathered to better determine our learners’ needs, helping us match individuals with relevant courses and, within UB, learning paths for a more personalized experience. Our learners also receive access to interactive learning tools such as quizzes, exercises, and instructor questions-and-answers, or Q&A.
Our UB offering helps over 10,500 global organizations, defined as companies of all sizes, nonprofits, and government agencies, whom we refer to as UB customers or enterprise customers, support employees’ professional growth and personal development through learning. The UB course catalog reflects the continuous curation of our broader platform content; we select for the most engaging, relevant, and high-quality courses that best fit the requirements of organizations. Our rigorous curation process considers factors such as learner feedback and ratings, topic relevance, content quality, and instructor engagement.
Our solution: the world’s learning platform
Our platform allows individual learners and organizations all over the world to access affordable, relevant, and up-to-date content from experts and experienced practitioners in nearly every field. We combine this high-quality content with data insights and technology to create a platform purpose-built to meet the specific needs of learners, instructors, and organizations.
In effect, our platform delivers a powerful flywheel of content creation, engagement, and continuous content optimization. Our expert instructors continuously generate new courses and update existing ones, while our marketplace encourages engagement on the most in-demand topics. The volume and frequency of these interactions allow us to generate meaningful insights and provide real-time feedback and analytics for our instructors. These data insights in turn improve content quality, enhance course personalization, and optimize productivity and satisfaction for our learners.
One way that we foster access to courses for individual learners and organizations is through broad content distribution across our various channels. We leverage machine learning (“ML”), to increase learner retention and conversion using enhanced personalization. At the same time, we believe our model encourages more relevant and engaging content through well-aligned incentives for our instructors, supported by consistent improvement from the feedback and data collected from individual learners and UB customers.
Over 19,000 free courses are available on our platform. These free courses represent an important entry point for learners to experience our platform. Through this free content, we are able to build a large and cost-effective top of the funnel for both consumer and UB leads. Once learners interact with our platform, our ML algorithms recommend courses for learners to purchase based on topic, quality, instructor rating, number of enrollments, learner’s country of origin, and more. The algorithms help us maximize revenue while offering the best value to learners. 
We also offer unlimited access to a curated catalog of courses through our Consumer, Enterprise, and Team plan subscriptions. The courses selected for the subscription offerings are among the highest quality, most relevant, and most popular on our platform. Pricing for our subscription plans typically begins at a price of $30 per seat per month, subject to geographic variations.

What we offer our learners
We provide 49 million learners with relevant, affordable, and high-quality content, and we do this on a platform that enables the constant improvement of our courses by leveraging the social validation of over 680 million course enrollments, as well as thousands of ratings and reviews. With Udemy, learners can fulfill objectives involving:
•Technical skills: Learners often seek to gain proficiency in the latest technology, which helps them stay competitive through upskilling or reskilling their capabilities.
•Business skills: Business and professional soft skills, such as negotiation strategy or team leadership, are in constant demand as individuals look to advance their careers, react to new workplace environments, or take on new responsibilities.
•Personal development: Learners like to complement their primary skills with discovery of new interests or hobbies such as music, drawing, and wellness.
Learners on Udemy receive a comprehensive and immersive experience through interactive exercises and the ability to communicate directly with instructors through question-and-answer functionality. Our courses feature world-class instructors like Angela Yu, founder of the programming bootcamp London App Brewery, and Jose Portilla, the Head of Data Science of Pierian Data.
We work to create a trusted and welcoming platform for learners by implementing policies and procedures intended to encourage respectful behavior. This includes requiring instructors to respect the intellectual property rights of others and prohibiting the posting of any inappropriate, offensive, false, or infringing content. As part of our publication process, we assess whether courses satisfy a checklist of technical criteria related to their audio, video, and course descriptions, and we reject courses on topics prohibited on our platform. Additionally, Udemy enables learners and other parties to easily report conduct that violates our policies, and our Trust & Safety team maintains processes to take action when we become aware of policy violations, which can range from the temporary disabling of communications features in cases of excessive use to the removal of content and termination of accounts in cases of more serious policy violations, such as the posting of infringing content.
Our refund policy for courses purchased on our consumer marketplace offers learners the ability to request a cash or credit refund up to 30 days from their purchase, subject to certain refund policy guidelines. 
What we offer our UB customers
We have over 10,500 global UB customers, including 49 of the Fortune 100. Companies such as Citi, Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Consultancy Services, Booz Allen Hamilton, PayPal, Box, Sapient, and Eventbrite are trusting UB to help them achieve their learning and development goals, drawn by the real-world expertise and experience of our instructors.
We are focused on helping UB customers upskill and reskill their teams to increase productivity, inspire innovation, address digital transformation, and drive talent retention, particularly in a post-COVID-19 world. UB customers typically express high satisfaction with their UB experience, resulting in our average net promoter score of 61 and an average course rating from UB learners of 4.5 out of 5.0 stars, in each case as of December 31, 2021. 
Our content is relevant to organizations across a variety of industries and includes courses in subjects like technology and business skills. Our curated UB offering begins with over 6,800 of the most engaging and relevant courses available on our platform, selected to meet the needs and standards of some of the world’s largest enterprises. As a part of this offering, we also offer over 7,500 additional non-English language courses, which includes collections in Spanish, Portuguese, German, Japanese, French, Italian, Mandarin, Turkish, Polish, Korean, Russian, Arabic and Indonesian. 
We use a rigorous selection process across a wide set of criteria to determine the courses that will be offered as part of UB, including:
Table of Contents

•User behavior: Learner feedback and ratings, as well as content searches, help us determine which courses to maintain or add to UB.
•Customer input: Specific content requests, prospects’ requests for proposal, and customer success stories are evaluated to identify new areas of focus that help ensure the continued strong relevance of our offering.
•
•Market research: Industry trends and instructor interviews help us determine relevant topics and new technologies valued by enterprises and their employees.
•Competitor analysis: We monitor market data and analyst reports on an ongoing basis to stay at the forefront of market demand and quickly address any applicable gaps within the topics offered.
We constantly update and enhance the curated list of courses included in the UB course catalog in response to industry changes and technological advancement. As of December 31, 2021, the UB course catalog included over 8,400 courses related to technical skills and over 6,100 courses related to business, personal and professional skills. On average, during 2021, over 500 new courses were added each month. Our overall UB course catalog has increased from fewer than 2,500 courses in 2017 to over 14,000 today.
In addition to high-quality content, we provide the tools and insights necessary for enterprise administrators, managers, and teams to create learning paths. These learning paths allow organizations to assemble customized learning series made up of Udemy courses, the organization’s own material, and links to external resources. Learning paths are only visible within the organization that creates them, and offer a unique benefit to administrators and employees. 
We also offer UB customers a comprehensive analytics dashboard and other powerful tools through which they gain high visibility into the progress, areas of focus, and feedback of their employees. This strong set of tools, which includes our learning playbooks, helps our UB customers better understand and optimize learning experiences for their employees and ensure they are delivering a strong and measurable return on their investment in learning skills.
What we offer our instructors
We offer instructors from around the world access to a global audience of 49 million learners. Our model allows instructors who elect to charge for courses to share directly in the economic upside of the course content they contribute and the growth of our platform. We have an aligned incentive model where payments to instructors are proportional to course sales on our platform. In 2021, our paid instructors earned $176.9 million from Udemy for their courses. In 2020, our paid instructors earned $161.4 million from Udemy for their courses. The breadth of instructors and courses contributes to the wide variety of content topics available on our platform, as well as meaningful depth within most content categories. We believe that this combination of breadth and depth helps foster competition and choice on our platform and attracts learners and enterprise customers.
We enable our instructors to drive innovation and ongoing engagement on our platform. We not only provide instructors access to millions of learners but also offer proprietary tools to help them generate more relevant and better content. Instructors are able to use platform insights, review feedback from learners, and harness analytics dashboards to manage their course content, brand, and course marketing. As instructors upgrade their courses, our performance marketing engine identifies and selects the best courses to be featured to each learner around the world. Our marketing engine targets and reaches millions of learners, many more times what instructors would be able to reach on their own. Instructors can also enroll in our promotional pricing program. Through this promotional pricing program, we programmatically control the list price for courses offered through our consumer marketplace, as well as the discounted price shown to consumers during promotional events and campaigns, as and when such promotions occur in our discretion, based on course characteristics like category of content, hours of content, rating, and popularity. In addition, we offer instructors insight on the revenue opportunity and existing content for any given topic, and we provide auto-generated, translated captions from English to Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, and Polish, so instructors can better reach our global learner base.
Table of Contents

When an instructor’s course is added to the UB catalog, instructors are subject to an exclusivity clause for the use of their content on our platform, pursuant to which instructors agree, subject to limited exceptions, not to offer any on-demand content, such as pre-recorded courses, on any competing platform in a way that directly competes with or impairs the sales of such content on our platform. This exclusivity clause is effective for so long as an instructor’s content is included in the UB catalog, and we may continue to include content in the UB catalog for up to 12 months after an instructor elects to opt out of the UB catalog. We believe these exclusivity arrangements increase the value of our offerings by increasing the amount of unique content on Udemy and helping maintain our robust roster of expert instructors.
We believe that, on average, the value we offer instructors ultimately delivers a far higher return on investment relative to other content creation and online learning competitors.
Our growth strategies
We are still in the early stages of our long-term growth strategy. We expect to continue expanding our consumer and UB customer base, instructor network, and content catalog while increasing our market opportunities through the following strategies:
Accelerate the growth of our enterprise business through:

•Successfully executing on our land-and-expand strategy. Our strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and efficiently growing our relationships with existing customers, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Historically, we have expanded from individual to department to multi-department to enterprise-wide sales as UB’s value is proven and enterprise customers identify additional use cases. We intend to continue to expand our sales team footprint globally and to improve our upselling tactics with the assistance of better tools and systems. In addition to inbound leads from our direct-to-consumer offering, we have developed a strong outbound lead-generation process with highly effective account-based marketing operations, allowing us to target, develop, and nurture key accounts in large organizations.
•Improving quality and relevance of our courses. We curate our enterprise catalog by selecting the highest-rated and most engaging courses from our consumer business. We intend to continue leveraging our large platform to source high-quality and relevant curricula. We will also continue to improve the speed and efficiency of our curation processes, enabling us to quickly discern the content most relevant to our enterprise customers.
•Integrating our UB offering with employees’ workflow. We provide easy-to-implement learning playbooks, which enable customers to combine UB courses with their own in-house training to create blended learning programs. UB learners can also take advantage of our personalized content recommendations, which we derive from the data we collect. We currently integrate with existing employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, including our customers’ learning management systems and learning experience platforms, to help enable a more robust offering for UB learners and greater employer visibility into learning. Examples of these integrations include Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, Slack, and ServiceNow. Integrations enable UB customers to incorporate learning in the flow of work: learners can discover, search, and consume our UB catalog. Leaders can sync, track, and report learning progress for employees across other HR systems and also encourage learning across the organization through reminders and sharing on existing company messaging platforms. Looking forward, we intend to expand our offering to integrate with additional employee learning-and-development and HR workflows, and to introduce additional services for employees, thus expanding usage within our UB customers.
•Deliver immersive learning experiences. Our platform currently offers powerful learning experiences including practice tests, coding exercises, and quizzes, which permit learners to prepare for certification exams and better retain what they have learned. We intend to expand our offerings to include deeper skills assessments, labs, and cohort-based learning. Assessments increase learning efficiency by identifying further areas of study for learners. Labs enable learners to practice the skills they are learning in the applicable technical environments. Cohort-based learning combines synchronous and asynchronous learning together with reflections and virtual classroom time, enabling learning from one’s

peers and creating accountability to the cohort for course completion and live participation. We will also consider acquisitions to expand the immersive learning experiences we offer, with a goal of improving learner outcomes and ultimately increasing retention.
Increase learner retention through:
•Building a global personalization engine. Since the beginning of 2020, we have invested considerable resources in developing a personalization-based technology platform, which includes:
–State-of-the-art eventing platform to track and store every learner interaction with our site and apps;
–Customer data platform to structure and analyze all of our learner data;
–Lifecycle marketing platform to develop, train, and operationalize personalization algorithms; and
–Campaign management platform to link personalization algorithms with customer-facing touch-points such as website placements, emails, and push notifications among others.
Our personalization efforts are only beginning. We believe that these investments will yield high returns around customer engagement, retention, and lifetime value in the years to come.
•Expanding our subscription offering. In early 2021, we launched a direct-to-consumer subscription in beta testing. In its initial format, the subscription offering is similar to our Team plan offering focused on professional skills. Our objective is to provide consumers ongoing access to the platform’s best content for a monthly fee. We believe there is broad demand for learning subscriptions, and we are uniquely positioned to provide a compelling and highly competitive product. We plan to test and launch additional forms of subscriptions including bootcamp-style courses with assessments and labs to help learners reach new levels of proficiency. We believe that consumer subscriptions, in the absence of employer-sponsored access, will increase the retention of individual learners who seek to continuously acquire new skills and value greater ongoing access to content. Offering different subscription packages based on area of expertise or added features, for example, will allow us to capture different types of individual learners at different price points, all while increasing their engagement with Udemy.
Expand our geographic footprint through:
•Organic expansion. We enter new countries via courses taught in English, as they appeal to a broad audience globally. As the platform grows in popularity through organic levers such as word of mouth or search engine optimization, local instructors create courses in their native languages, increasing Udemy’s appeal to learners fluent in those languages. As of December 31, 2021, we offered over 70,000 courses in languages other than English. We will continue to invest in our technology and our brand to drive search engine optimization and word of mouth in order to continue the organic growth.
•Executing our international playbook. As the content catalog expands in each country, we start investing in additional growth levers such as local payment methods, local currency pricing, and local marketing. These investments drive higher traffic, enrollments, and revenue for our direct-to-consumer business, as well as leads for UB. Once we reach a steady volume of leads to UB, we build in-country go-to-market sales teams to grow and expand our UB customer base. We also may partner with local companies that have an interest in growing the adult learning market in their countries. We have executed our international playbook in a number of countries, including Brazil, India, and Japan, and we are in the process of similar investments in Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and other key geographic markets. Our international playbook will continue to allow us to build a targeted list of countries in which we anticipate we will expand with a high likelihood of success.
Competition
The market for developing skills is rapidly growing and highly competitive. We compete for individual learners, enterprise customers, and instructors on the following basis:
Table of Contents

•Learners: We compete for learners based on our course catalog, instructors, and learning tools. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of our ability to attract instructors and support them with data and insights to create and refresh high-quality content.
•Udemy Business customers: We compete for customers based on our up-to-date content, the breadth and depth of that content across the full range of core business functions, and advanced product features that optimize self-paced learning and enable organizations to effectively drive programmatic learning. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of the synergies between our consumer and UB businesses, and the strategic partnerships we form with our UB customers that help them drive engagement in their learning programs and, in turn, business outcomes like employee retention and corporate productivity.
•Instructors: We compete for instructors based on our ability to provide monetization opportunities. We believe that we are positioned favorably because of our ability to attract learners across the globe, provide data and insights to help instructors to retain learners, and offer an attractive shared revenue model.
We believe the competitive landscape is not well-suited to address the growing need for people to develop skills that are continuously and rapidly evolving. The traditional publisher model can be slow moving and reactive. Other niche marketplace models cannot serve the learner of today who is focused on developing both the hard and soft skills. We expect to gain market share as our marketplace platform offers the breadth of skills needed by learners and organizations. Competition can include:
•Corporate training offerings, such as those from Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, and Skillsoft
•Direct-to-consumer training offerings, such as those from Coursera and edX
•Specialized content training offerings, such as those from A Cloud Guru and Skillshare
•Online free resources used to gather and share knowledge and skills
We believe our business model competes favorably based on multiple factors, including our vibrant ecosystem of learners, organizations and instructors; the differentiated breadth and depth of our marketplace; our data and analytics capabilities; and our global presence and brand recognition.
Sales and marketing
Consumers
Our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy focuses on brand and performance marketing, strategic partnerships, and lifecycle monetization. Brand marketing increases awareness while performance marketing drives incremental traffic among potential learners. The strength of our community and brand drives significant organic acquisition, with the majority of our customers coming from unpaid channels. Our strategic partnerships aim to increase reach by making Udemy courses discoverable on third-party websites and mobile apps. Finally, lifecycle marketing and monetization focuses on building personalization at scale, increasing learner retention and long-term value, optimizing prices and promotions, and testing new monetization models.
Udemy Business
Our consumer ecosystem helps drive UB marketing efficiency and provides leads for prospective UB customers. As we expand to new regions and countries, we first market to organizations to generate brand awareness and interest in our UB offering, and then our sales team identifies and engages with potential customers.
We sell to our UB customers both directly, through our sales teams, and indirectly, through third-party channels. Once an organization signs on, our customer success team partners closely with that organization to track progress toward business outcomes and determine opportunities for expanding usage.

Instructors
Global experts learn about Udemy in a variety of ways including awareness campaigns and by coming to the platform as learners. Once onboard, our platform provides instructors with insights into learner demand and financial opportunity, incentivizing them to create new course content. Our Instructor Partnership team works closely with our top instructors to share plans and develop new products and services.
Seasonality
Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders from new and existing UB customers in the fourth quarter of each year as a result of industry buying patterns. We defer the recognition of our UB bookings over the life of the contract. We also have traditionally seen increased bookings in the Consumer segment as the result of various holiday promotions offered in the fourth quarter. We defer the recognition of our consumer bookings over an estimated service period of 4 months. As a result of these recognition practices, the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. For more information, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Intellectual property
Our business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is critical to our success. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, trade dress, domain names, copyrights, and trademarks to protect our competitive advantage.
As of December 31, 2021, we held 12 registered trademarks in the United States and 24 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, which have various expiration dates between 2022 and 2031. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.udemy.com and some other variations.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Technology and research and development
Our technology consists of a global distribution platform designed to support all parties in the learning ecosystem. It features a modern architecture designed to support our continued growth at scale. Our goal is to provide world-class experiences across most screens and devices.
We have a cross-functional, agile team of data scientists, ML engineers, software engineers, and product managers focused on continuously improving our platform to address evolving customer needs. Thus far, the team has built algorithmic and model-driven solutions at scale to provide the following capabilities: personalized and differentiated experiences for all learners, comprehensive instructor tools for content delivery and student engagement, and insights dashboards for enterprises to track employee training progress.
We have built a closed-loop user journey on top of a robust, enterprise-grade technology platform. Through data collection over time, we are able to continue perfecting our learner personalization. Personalized learner experiences begin with offering the correct product and pricing to users through marketing, multi-offering communications, and customer data platforms. Using ML-based tools, we then drive a highly personalized user experience for our learners that includes optimizing the offering, time, and frequency of each communication, recommending relevant content based on learner objectives and preferences, and offering tailored promotions to drive retention and engagement. We also capture learner interest, goals, and searches at different times during the user journey so we can provide the best possible recommendations for courses and learning paths.
Table of Contents

We continuously gather market research and leverage user data to optimize the content available on our platform. Through our deep understanding of learner needs, we aim to deliver the right learning content, packaged the right way, and offered at the right time. The data gathered also provides powerful insight tools and feedback to our instructors so they can improve their courses and ultimately preserve the high quality of our overall offering.
Human capital resources
We believe we have a world-class culture with a highly engaged global employee base. We have achieved 4.1 of 5.0 stars on Glassdoor, a platform which represents voluntary reviews among current and former employees, as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, our company has been recognized as a Bay Area Best Place to Work by San Francisco Business Times and as a #1 employer in Turkey on the Great Place to Work lists during 2019, 2020, and 2021. As reflected in our annual employee survey, our employee engagement score is 77%, which is 1% above benchmark for companies at our size and stage.
We are proud of our internal focus on learning and development and leverage the UB platform to drive upskilling and career growth within our organization. “Always Learning” is a key value for our company. We hold monthly “Drop Everything and Learn” hours to provide employees with dedicated time they can use to learn professional or personal skills offered on our platform. We also use UB to provide our team with access to a wide range of content, from important all-company meetings to a variety of management training courses developed by our own Learning & Development team.
Our mission-driven approach to make knowledge opportunities accessible to learners around the world helps drive recruitment to our team. Udemy is the only digital learning company included in the Fortune 2020 Change the World list, and our employees enjoy the opportunity to be a part of a socially conscious brand benefiting all constituents. Overall, we are a leader in gender diversity among companies like ours, with 45% of our global workforce, 26% of our senior leadership, and 26% of our technical workforce identifying as women as of December 31, 2021.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,238 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by unions. We consider the relationship with our employees to be strong and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
