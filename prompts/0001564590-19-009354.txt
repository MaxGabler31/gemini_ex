Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company
 
We are an internally-managed Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused on managing a portfolio of commercial real estate (CRE) loans and properties.  As explained further below, we are currently undertaking steps intended to increase RAIT’s liquidity and better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due.  We were formed in August 1997 and commenced operations in January 1998. We conduct our business through our real estate lending, owning and managing segment concentrated on lending, owning and managing commercial real estate assets throughout the United States.  We incorporate the discussion of this business segment here from Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Business Strategy
 
RAIT’s business strategy has been evolving from September 2017 through the filing of this annual report in response to developments in RAIT’s business and financial situation.  On September 7, 2017, we announced that our Board of Trustees, or the board, had formed a committee of independent trustees, or the special committee, to explore and evaluate a wide range of possible strategic and financial alternatives for RAIT. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the special committee review had concluded and did not identify a strategic or financial transaction with another counterparty that was preferable to the steps described below. This special committee review, conducted with the support of financial and legal advisors, evaluated a wide range of potential alternatives which included, but were not limited to, (i) refinements of RAIT’s operations or strategy, (ii) financial transactions, such as a recapitalization or other change to RAIT’s capital structure and (iii) strategic transactions, such as a sale of all or part of RAIT.  As a result, the board, after considering the recommendations and advice of the special committee, RAIT’s management and legal and financial advisors, determined that RAIT should focus on taking steps to increase RAIT’s liquidity and better position RAIT to meet its financial obligations as they come due. We refer to these steps as the 2018 strategic steps and they include, but are not limited to: 
 
 
• | The suspension of our loan origination business along with the implementation of other steps to reduce costs within our other operating businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The continuation of the process of selling a significant portion of our owned real estate, or REO, portfolio, while continuing to service and manage our existing CRE loan portfolio; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The engagement of a financial advisor, M-III Advisory Partners, LP, or M3, to advise and assist RAIT in its ongoing assessment of its financial performance and financial needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 RAIT’s implementation of the 2018 strategic steps resulted in RAIT generating sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations arising during 2018, including the redemption by a RAIT subsidiary, RAIT Asset Holdings IV, LLC, or RAIT IV, of its preferred units which resulted in the cancellation of RAIT’s Series D preferred shares in June 2018 and the satisfaction of the put right of holders of our 4.0% senior convertible notes in October 2018, each as described below.  The board terminated the special committee in July 2018.  
 2019 Strategic Steps
 
Beginning in the second half of 2018, RAIT’s management, with direction from the board, resumed the review of the potential strategic and financial alternatives for RAIT, including certain alternatives previously considered in the special committee review.  As part of these efforts, RAIT management had preliminary discussions with various third parties to explore whether any of them were interested in any potential strategic and/or financial transaction or other action with respect to RAIT, its assets and/or its lending platform.  This review and related preliminary discussions continued through the fourth quarter of 2018 and are still ongoing at the time of filing of this annual report, and have been conducted with the support of financial and legal advisors, with the goals of seeking to maximize value for RAIT’s stakeholders in accordance with their respective interests and to address certain other adverse business and financial conditions facing RAIT, including those referenced below under “Going Concern Considerations.”  We refer to our continued implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, combined with our resumption of such review and holding these preliminary discussions, including, without limitation, any transactions or other actions contemplated thereby, as the 2019 strategic steps.   We cannot assure you that the 2019 strategic steps will result in any transaction or other action involving RAIT or of the effects that any action, transaction or inaction resulting from the 2019 strategic steps will have on any of RAIT’s stakeholders.  See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for further discussion of potential risks to stakeholders’ respective interests in RAIT that may result from the 2019 strategic steps, including, without limitation, any transactions with third parties involving the merger of RAIT with or into another company, the recapitalization or restructuring of RAIT and/or the sale of RAIT and/or some or all of its assets including effectuating such merger, recapitalization, restructure and/or sale through bankruptcy proceedings or other means.  RAIT does not intend to make 
 3


any further public comment regarding this review and these preliminary discussions until the outcome thereof is determined, except as may be required by law.
 2018 Business Developments 
 
Key developments related to the 2018 strategic steps included the following:
 
 
• | Redemption of the Series D Preferred Shares
--+--------------------------------------------


o | On June 27, 2018, we redeemed and cancelled the remaining 2,939,190 Series D preferred shares (and linked preferred units of RAIT’s subsidiary, RAIT Asset Holdings IV, LLC, or RAIT IV) for (a) $56.8 million of cash received by RAIT IV from a transaction resulting in the transfer of RAIT IV’s retained interests in the following two securitizations previously consolidated by RAIT in its consolidated financial statements: RAIT 2015-FL5 Trust, or FL5, and RAIT 2016-FL6 Trust, or FL6; (b) defined available cash held by RAIT IV; and (c) shares of RAIT’s publicly traded 7.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, or the Series A preferred shares, 8.375% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, or the Series B preferred shares, and 8.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, or the Series C preferred shares, with an aggregate $16.7 million of liquidation preference. Refer to section titled “Sale of FL5 Interests & FL6 Interests and Series D Preferred Shares Redemption” below for further information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Debt Reductions
--+----------------


o | RAIT’s indebtedness, based on principal amount, declined by $777.1 million, or 54.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2018.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Total recourse debt, excluding RAIT’s secured warehouse facilities, declined by $125.9 million, or 43.2% during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we repaid all outstanding borrowings on our secured warehouse facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset Monetization Plan and Liquidity Position
--+-----------------------------------------------


o | For the year ended December 31, 2018, RAIT has monetized a portion of its loans and real estate assets with an aggregate book value of $322.2 million. These monetizations include sales of loans, sales of real estate assets and repayments of loans. After selling costs and repayment of obligations directly secured by a portion of those assets of $169.2 million, RAIT received net proceeds of $153.0 million. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT’s cash and cash equivalents balance, as of December 31, 2018, was $42.5 million and, as of March 15, 2019, was $40.2 million.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compensation & General and Administrative, or G&A, Expenses
--+------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT implemented a reduction in force of certain of its employees determined to be non-essential to RAIT’s implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, which has contributed to the reduced run rate of base compensation expense from approximately $2.5 million per quarter at December 31, 2017 to approximately $1.4 million per quarter subsequent to the reduction in force.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT implemented a retention plan, which was successful in incentivizing RAIT’s executive and non-executive employees to remain employed at RAIT through the end of 2018 in order to permit such employees to implement the 2018 strategic steps. A new retention plan was implemented in January 2019 to cover the first quarter of 2019 as part of the implementation of the 2019 strategic steps. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In connection with the implementation and execution of the 2019 strategic steps, the 2018 strategic steps, the earlier strategic alternatives process, the redemption of the Series D preferred shares discussed above and other matters, including our NYSE listing status, RAIT incurred significant legal and consulting expenses which led to an increased level of G&A expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018. These items contributed to $15.9 million of G&A expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Results
 
 
• | We are reporting a net loss allocable to common shares of $(133.1) million, or $(72.37) per common share-diluted for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $(184.7) million, or $(100.99) per common share-diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT incurred asset impairment charges of $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These charges were primarily related to properties which were affected by local market conditions and/or for which we accepted offers to sell as part of our efforts to increase our liquidity. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | RAIT also incurred a provision for loan losses of $32.9 million, which was primarily driven by loans where the borrower and/or property experienced an unfavorable event or events during the year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sale of FL5 Interests & FL6 Interests and Series D Preferred Shares Redemption
 
On June 27, 2018, RAIT IV completed the sale of its FL5 interests, as referenced below, and FL6 interests, as referenced below and together with the FL5 interests, the FL interests, to Melody RE II, LLC, or the FL purchaser, for an aggregate purchase price of $54.6 million.

Prior to the sale, RAIT, through its subsidiary RAIT IV, was the holder of:
 
 
• | 60% of the units, or the FL5 interests, of RAIT – Melody 2016 Holdings, LLC, or Holdings 2016, which controls RAIT – Melody 2016 Holdings Trust. This trust owned, at the time of sale, various classes of non-investment grade bonds and the equity of FL5 with the remaining 40% of the units of Holdings 2016 being held by affiliates of the FL purchaser; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 60% of the units, or the FL6 interests, of RAIT – Melody 2017 Holdings, LLC, or Holdings 2017, which controls RAIT – Melody 2017 Holdings Trust. This trust owned, at the time of sale, various classes of non-investment grade bonds and the equity of FL6 with the remaining 40% of the units of Holdings 2017 being held by affiliates of the FL purchaser.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Prior to the sale, RAIT consolidated Holdings 2016 and FL5 and also consolidated Holdings 2017 and FL6 in its consolidated financial statements as RAIT was the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities, or VIEs.  Holdings 2016 and Holdings 2017 have been referred to as the RAIT Venture VIEs in RAIT’s consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the sale, RAIT was no longer considered the primary beneficiary of these entities and has deconsolidated these entities from its consolidated financial statements.  RAIT recognized a loss of $8.2 million on the deconsolidation of these entities as the aggregate purchase price for the Interests of $54.6 million was less than RAIT’s net investment in these entities of $62.8 million.  After the sale of the Interests, RAIT retained its role as servicer and special servicer of the loans in FL5 and FL6.
 
Also on June 27, 2018, RAIT, several of RAIT’s subsidiaries, and ARS VI Investor I, LP, or the Series D investor, entered into a redemption and exchange agreement, or the Series D redemption and exchange agreement, whereby RAIT redeemed and cancelled the remaining 2,939,190 preferred units of RAIT IV and corresponding Series D preferred shares for (a) $54.6 million of cash (received by RAIT IV from the sale of the FL interests); (b) $2.2 million of defined available cash held by RAIT IV; and (c) shares of RAIT’s publicly traded Series A preferred shares with an aggregate $9.6 million liquidation preference, Series B preferred shares with an aggregate $4.2 million liquidation preference and Series C preferred shares with an aggregate $2.9 million liquidation preference.  In addition, RAIT paid the Series D investor an exchange fee of $0.4 million.  The Series D redemption and exchange agreement also provided for the termination of the Securities Purchase Agreement among RAIT, identified RAIT affiliates and the Series D investor, or the Series D purchase agreement, and mutual releases between RAIT and the Series D investor.  The redemption and exchange of the preferred units of RAIT IV and the linked Series D preferred shares resulted in an increase to shareholders equity of $11.9 million as the consideration exchanged of $61.6 million was less than the $73.5 million aggregate liquidation preference of Series D preferred shares that were redeemed and cancelled.
 
NYSE Delisting
 
On May 11, 2018, the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, suspended trading in RAIT’s securities then listed on the NYSE, which we collectively refer to as the RAIT publicly traded securities:  RAIT’s common shares, or the common shares, Series A preferred shares, Series B preferred shares, Series C preferred shares, RAIT’s 7.625% senior notes and RAIT’s 7.125% senior notes.  The NYSE carried out this suspension and commenced proceedings to delist the RAIT publicly traded securities from the NYSE when the trading price of the common shares decreased to below $0.16 per share on May 11, 2018 because the NYSE, in interpreting NYSE continued listing standards, determined that a trading price of below $0.16 per share was “abnormally low” and, therefore, was cause for suspension of trading and delisting from the NYSE. As previously reported, on June 5, 2018, the NYSE notified RAIT that RAIT was no longer in compliance with another continued listing standard because RAIT had not maintained at least a $15.0 million average market capitalization over a 30 trading-day period.  On December 4, 2018, RAIT received the final decision of the NYSE to delist the RAIT publicly traded securities and, on December 6, 2018, the NYSE filed a Form 25 for each RAIT publicly traded security with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, notifying the SEC of the NYSE’s determination to remove the RAIT publicly traded securities from listing on the NYSE, or the delisting, and to terminate the registration, or the 12(b) deregistration, of the RAIT publicly traded securities under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The delisting became effective on December 17, 2018 and the 12(b) deregistration became effective on March 5, 2019. The RAIT publicly traded securities now trade on the OTCQB. The delisting and 12(b) deregistration, in and of themselves, do not affect the trading of the RAIT publicly traded securities on the OTCQB or RAIT’s reporting requirements under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and did not cause an event of default under any of RAIT’s then outstanding debt obligations.
 
5


Reverse Stock Split
 
Effective after the close of trading on August 13, 2018, we completed a one for fifty reverse stock split, or the reverse stock split, as previously authorized by the board, pursuant to authority granted to the board by RAIT’s common shareholders. The par value of common shares changed to $1.50 per share after the reverse stock split from $0.03 per share prior to the reverse stock split and every fifty shares issued and outstanding prior to the reverse stock split were combined into one common share after the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split did not change the number of authorized common shares. The financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split and all share and per share amounts have been adjusted accordingly. The reverse stock split did not affect RAIT’s preferred shares, including the number of authorized or outstanding RAIT preferred shares or the dividend rate per share of any outstanding RAIT preferred shares.
Going Concern Considerations
 
Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements —Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Going Concern
 Considerations” and Part I, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
 Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of going concern considerations.
 
CRE Lending
 
RAIT’s CRE lending platform previously focused on the origination of first lien loans. We historically also offered mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in limited circumstances to support first lien loans.  These represent a smaller portion of our CRE loan portfolio.  Our mezzanine loans are subordinate in repayment priority to a senior mortgage loan or loans on a property and are typically secured by pledges of ownership interests, in whole or in part, in the entities that own the real property. We generate a return on our preferred equity investments primarily through distributions to us at a fixed rate and the payment of distributions are subject to there being sufficient net cash flow from the underlying real estate to make such payments. We used this investment structure as an alternative to a mezzanine loan where the financial needs and tax situation of the borrower, the terms of senior financing secured by the underlying real estate or other circumstances necessitate holding preferred equity.  Our CRE loans are in most cases non-recourse or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities. This means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment, subject to certain standard exceptions. Where possible, we sought to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers, as opposed to investing in loans controlled by third-party lenders.  
 
Prior to our implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, our financing strategy involved the use of multiple sources of short-term financing to originate assets including warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements and bank conduit facilities.  Our ultimate goal was to finance these investments on a long-term, non-recourse, match-funded basis or to sell these assets into CMBS securitizations.  Match funding enabled us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing, thereby reducing interest rate risk and funding risks in financing our portfolio on a long-term basis. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold certain loans which had an unpaid principal balance of $128.8 million and received gross proceeds of $123.1 million. We received $74.9 million of net proceeds after payment of the costs to sell those loans and repayments of indebtedness secured by certain of those loans of $48.2 million.  
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated $46.2 million of CRE loans prior to our implementation of the 2018 strategic steps, received CRE loan repayments of $391.2 million and deconsolidated loans with an unpaid principal balance of $266.6 million.  
 
The tables below describe certain characteristics of our held-for-investment commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):
 
 
 | Book Value | | Weighted- Average Coupon | | Range of Maturities | Number of Loans 
-----------------------------+------------+---------+--------------------------+------+---------------------+-----------------------
Commercial Real Estate (CRE) | | | | | | | 
Commercial mortgages | $ | 453,217 | | 6.9 | % | Feb. 2019 to Jun. 2025 | 35
Mezzanine loans | | 21,278 | | 13.3 | % | Jun. 2020 to Mar. 2023 | 3 
Preferred equity interests | | 28,576 | | 6.0 | % | Mar. 2023 to Jun. 2029 | 13
Total CRE | $ | 503,071 | | 7.2 | % | | 51

 
Certain of our commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms.  We refer to these loans as cash flow loans, all of which were originated prior 
 6


to 2011.  Although a cash flow loan accrues interest at a stated rate, pursuant to forbearance or other agreements, the borrower is only required to pay interest each month at a minimum rate, which may be as low as zero percent, plus additional interest up to the stated rate to the extent of all cash flow from the property underlying the loan after the payment of property operating expenses and any senior debt service.  Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition” for further information on these loans.  As of December 31, 2018, we held investments we characterized as cash flow loans, with a recorded investment (including accrued interest) of $75.9 million comprised of preferred equity interests totaling $36.2 million, bridge loans totaling $9.5 million and mezzanine loans totaling $30.2 million.  
 
As of December 31, 2018, our nonaccrual loans total $93.0 million, which is comparable to the $98.6 million of nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2017.  We remain focused on working with our borrowers on these loans to either sell or refinance the underlying properties or to implement other strategies to maximize the value of these assets to us over time.  As of December 31, 2018, we had a loan loss reserve of $22.3 million, representing 24.0% of our nonaccrual loans and 4.4% of our total CRE loan portfolio.  As of December 31, 2017, our loan loss reserve was $14.9 million, which represented 15.1% of our nonaccrual loans and 1.2% of our total CRE loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized provision for loan losses of $32.9 million, which were primarily driven by certain loans where the borrower and/or property experienced an unfavorable event or events during the period.
 
We have financed our consolidated CRE loans on a long-term basis through securitizations. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Securitization Summary” for more information about our securitizations.

REO properties
 
As described above, during 2018, we continued to sell and/or divest our legacy REO portfolio.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold five properties for $106.2 million. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate portfolio consisted of an aggregate gross cost (carrying value) of $116.6 million ($107.8 million), comprised of $48.8 million ($40.6 million) of office properties, $49.1 million ($48.5 million) of retail properties, and $18.7 million ($18.7 million) of land.  We disposed of one additional REO property with an aggregate gross cost (carrying value), as of December 31, 2018, of approximately $4.9 million ($4.9 million) during the first quarter of 2019.  
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized impairment charges on real estate assets of $47.5 million as it was more likely than not that we would dispose of the assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives and a portion of our recorded investment in these assets was determined to not be recoverable.  These impairment charges are further described below.

• | Due to the current conditions affecting one of our retail properties in its local market, we recognized an impairment charge of $13.5 million based on a third-party appraisal.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Due to the current conditions affecting another of our retail properties in its local market, as well as our efforts to increase liquidity pursuant to the 2018 strategic steps, we accepted an offer to purchase this asset which resulted in an impairment charge of $17.4 million based on an executed purchase and sale agreement, subsequent negotiations to sell the asset and the ultimate sales price we received for the asset.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Due to upcoming lease expirations and/or current market conditions, we recognized impairment charges on two other properties (office and land). The analysis performed on each property, which included third-party appraisals, resulted in impairment charges totaling $3.2 million.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We recognized impairment charges of $9.8 million on four assets based on the status of negotiations for the sale of the assets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We recognized an impairment charge of $3.6 million on another asset as a result of a default on the asset’s associated ground lease.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are continuing to market for sale certain of our real estate properties, and the ultimate outcomes of the sales of those properties are dependent on current market conditions and demand specific to each individual property. If we identify additional properties for disposition, our decision to no longer hold them for investment may result in future impairment charges. 
 
We have financed our portfolio of investments in commercial real estate through secured commercial mortgage loans held by either third-party lenders or our commercial real estate securitizations.

Certain REIT and Investment Company Act Limits on Our Strategies
 
REIT Limits
 
We conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT. We also conduct the operations of our subsidiary, Taberna Realty Finance Trust, or TRFT to qualify as a REIT, and any REITs we may sponsor or otherwise consolidate in the future, which we collectively refer to as our REIT affiliates, to each qualify as a REIT.  Please see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13: Income Taxes” for further discussion.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our interests in two other REITs, RAIT-Melody 2016 Holdings Trust, or Melody FL-5, and RAIT-Melody 2017 Holdings Trust, or Melody FL-6, and, as such, no longer conduct the operations of these REITs.  Our exit of our Taberna securitization segment in 2014 did not involve selling TRFT, which continues to hold assets and liabilities unrelated to the Taberna segment. For a discussion of the tax implications of our and our REIT affiliates’ REIT status to us and our shareholders, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To qualify as a REIT, we and our REIT affiliates must continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income, nature and diversification of assets, amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares. In order to satisfy these tests, we and our REIT affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made. Accordingly, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our or our REIT affiliates’ investment performance. These requirements include the following:

• | For each of ourselves and our REIT affiliates, at least 75% of total assets and 75% of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets, whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our or our REIT affiliates’ best investment alternative. For example, since our investments in the debt or equity of certain securitizations are not qualifying real estate assets, to the extent that we have historically invested in such assets, or may do so in the future, we must hold substantial investments in qualifying real estate assets, including mortgage loans and CMBS, which may have lower yields than such investments. Also, at least 95% of each of our and our REIT affiliates’ gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including any mortgage loans, held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities, and therefore may limit our and our REIT affiliates’ ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets.

• | Overall, no more than 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs. During 2016, we restructured certain of our TRS

entities by moving four former separate TRSs under a single TRS holding company (RAIT JV TRS Sub, LLC) in order to streamline our business operations and decrease administrative processes. Our TRSs currently hold a limited number of assets, including: RAIT JV TRS Sub, LLC (the holding company for entities that issued one of our junior subordinated notes and the entity party to our CMBS facilities), Taberna Equity Funding, Ltd. (the holding company for equity issued by a securitization) and RAIT Sharpstown TRS LLC (the holding company that previously owned a 1% ownership interest of a retail center located in Houston, Texas). Our and our REIT affiliates’ use of fee-generating businesses held in a TRS, as well as the business of future TRSs we or our REIT affiliates may form, will be limited by our and our REIT affiliates’ need to meet this 25% (20% for years beginning after December 31, 2017) test, though we do not currently expect to utilize or expand these businesses under our current business strategy.

• | The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit our and our REIT affiliates’ ability to hedge mortgage-backed securities, preferred securities and related borrowings. Except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, or the Treasury regulations, any income from a hedging transaction we or our REIT affiliates enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets, which is clearly identified as specified in the Treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (and will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test). To the extent that we or our REIT affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions, which we do not currently expect to do, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non- qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result, we or our REIT affiliates might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through TRSs. This could increase the cost of our or our REIT affiliates’ hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear.

There are other risks arising out of our and our REIT affiliates’ need to comply with REIT requirements. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors-Tax Risks” below.
 
Investment Company Act Limits
 
We seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company. Under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, a company is not deemed to be an “investment company” if:

• | it neither is, nor holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, nor proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. “Investment securities” excludes U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act (relating to issuers whose securities are held by not more than 100 persons or whose securities are held only by qualified purchasers, as defined).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We rely on the 40% test because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries. As a result, the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a combined value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis. Based on the relative value of our investment in TRFT, on the one hand, and our investment in RAIT Partnership, on the other hand, we can comply with the 40% test only if RAIT Partnership itself complies with the 40% test (or an exemption other than those provided by Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7)). Because the principal exemptions that RAIT Partnership relies upon to allow it to meet the 40% test are those provided by Sections 3(c)(5)(C) or 3(c)(6) (relating to subsidiaries primarily engaged in specified real estate activities), we are limited in the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries.
 
None of RAIT, RAIT Partnership or any of their subsidiaries has received a no-action letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding whether it complies with the Investment Company Act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the Investment Company Act that it is using. To the extent that the SEC provides more specific or different guidance regarding, for example, the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets, we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Other Regulatory and Legal Risks of Our Business- Loss of our Investment Company Act exemption would affect us adversely.”

Competition
 
We have historically been subject to significant competition in all aspects of our business. Prior to our decision to implement the 2018 strategic steps, existing industry participants and potential new entrants have competed with us for the available supply of investments suitable for origination or acquisition, as well as for debt and equity capital. We also saw increasing amounts of competition from new entrants in the market to originate conduit loans and bridge loans. We have competed with many third parties engaged in real estate finance and investment activities, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. With respect to our investments in real estate, we face significant competition from other owners, operators and developers of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate. Competition may increase, and other companies and funds with investment objectives similar to ours may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors have, or in the future may have, substantially greater financial resources than we do and may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Consistent with the implementation and execution of the 2018 strategic steps, our competition continues to focus on other sellers of assets similar to those in our portfolio.
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2019, we had 25 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
