ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview

United Health Products, Inc. (“UHP” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, and markets a patented hemostatic gauze for the healthcare and wound care sectors. Our gauze product, HemoStyp®, is a neutralized, oxidized, regenerated cellulose (“NORC”) derived from cotton and designed to absorb exudate/drainage from superficial wounds and help control bleeding. We are in the process of seeking regulatory approval to sell our Hemostyp product line into the U.S. Class III and European CE Mark surgical markets.
Recent Developments

The following developments in the Company’s business have occurred during 2021 and prior to the filing of this report:


• | On January 21, 2021, the U.S. Patent Office provided notification of publication of the Company’s patent application for the method of forming and using a hemostatic hydrocolloid. This publication does not imply any assurance of the receipt of the patent but establishes an obligation of any party that seeks to use the applicable method to pay royalties for the right to do so. The patent application for this process remains pending as of the date of this filing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | On February 11, 2021, the Company was notified that its application to establish global patent protection for the process of creating and deploying a hydrocolloid (or gel) format of its previously patented HemoStyp technology was accepted for publication under the procedures of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, an international patent law treaty which provides a unified procedure for filing a patent application in most foreign countries. We previously filed provisional patent applications for our HemoStyp hydrocolloid process in 2020. In January 2022 the Company initiated steps to register its hydrocolloid patent in the European common market and nine additional foreign countries where we intend to commercialize any future HemoStypo gel formats. . 
• | In May 2021 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided a series of questions and comments on our Premarket Approval (PMA) application, primarily related to the manufacturing process and standard operating procedures. Subsequent to this communication the Company acquired and implemented industry standard good manufacturing practice (GMP) software and submitted specific responses to the FDA in October 2021. On January 18, 2022 the FDA requested that these responses be incorporated into our full PMA application and the application be reformatted and submitted using the FDA’s Electronic Submission Gateway (ESG). We are working with our regulatory consulting partner to complete the FDA’s requested actions. 

Our HemoStyp Gauze Products

HemoStyp hemostatic gauze is a collagen-like natural substance created from chemically treated cellulose derived from cotton. It is an effective hemostatic agent registered with the FDA for superficial use under a 510k approval obtained in 2012 to help control bleeding from open wounds and body cavities. The HemoStyp hemostatic material contains no chemical additives, thrombin, collagen or animal-derived products, and is hypoallergenic. When the product comes in contact with blood it expands slightly and quickly converts to a translucent gel that subsequently breaks down into glucose and salts. Because of its benign impact on body tissue and the fact that it degrades to non-toxic end products, HemoStyp does not impede the healing of body tissue as do certain competing hemostatic products. Laboratory testing has shown HemoStyp to be 100% absorbable in the human body within 24 hours, compared to days or weeks with competing organic regenerated cellulose products. A human trial conducted in 2019 and 2020 demonstrated the effectiveness of HemoStyp in vascular, thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures.

HemoStyp hemostatic gauze is a flexible, silk-like material that is applied by placing the gauze onto the bleeding tissue. The supple material can be easily folded and manipulated as needed to fit the size of the wound or incision. In surface bleeding and surgical situations, the product quickly converts to a translucent gel that allows the physician or surgeon to monitor the coagulation process. The gel maintains a neutral pH level which avoids damaging the surrounding tissue. In superficial bleeding situations, HemoStyp can be bonded to an adhesive plastic bandage or integrated into a traditional gauze component to address a broad range of needs, including traumatic bleeding injuries and prolonged bleeding following hemodialysis.

Potential Target Markets

Our HemoStyp material is currently cut to several sizes and configuration and marketed as HemoStyp Gauze. While we have paused our commercial activities to focus on our Class III PMA application, our potential customer base includes, without limitation, the following:

• | Hospitals and Surgery Centers for all Internal Surgical usage (in the event we obtain FDA Class III approval)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Hospitals, Clinics and Physicians for external trauma 
• | EMS, Fire Departments and other First Responders 
• | Military Medical Care Providers 
• | Hemodialysis centers 
• | Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities 
• | Dental and Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Offices 
• | Veterinary hospitals 

Primary Strategy

Or HemoStyp technology received an FDA 510k approval in 2012 for use in external or superficial bleeding situations and we believe there is an opportunity for HemoStyp products to address unmet needs in several medical applications that represent attractive commercial opportunities. However, the Class III surgical markets, both domestic and international, represent the most attractive market for our products due to the smaller number of competitors offering Class III approved hemostatic agents and the resulting premium pricing for products that can meet the demanding requirements of the human surgical environment. Our extensive laboratory testing and our completed human trial indicate that the HemoStyp technology can successfully compete against established Class III market participants and allow us to gain a significant market share. 

In 2018, we made the decision to focus our efforts and resources on accessing these Class III markets to maximize the value potential of our HemoStyp. The Class III PMA process required a substantial investment of time and resources so we made the strategic determination to pause our sales and marketing to non-Class III markets in order to devote our full attention to the FDA process. In the fourth quarter of 2021, with our PMA application largely complete and under review by the FDA, we re-engaged with certain consumers and distributors of 510-k hemostatic products with the objective of developing a revenue channel in this market going forward. Our primary market focus for this initiative includes the hemodialysis and emergency medicine sectors.

In anticipation of receiving a Class III PMA, we are evaluating paths to rapidly grow our revenue and profits in all potential market segments, with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. Options under consideration include (i) a sale or merger of the Company with an industry leader in the wound care and surgical device sectors, which may include a pre-sale collaboration on commercialization and distribution, (ii) one or more commercial partnerships with established market participants, without any specific, associated sale or merger transaction, and (iii) a capital raising program to establish and grow our own marketing and distribution capabilities and drive revenue and profits organically.

The Company has been contacted by several medical technology companies that are active in the surgical equipment and hemostatic products sectors, and who have expressed an interest in the Company’s products and business strategy. In response to these inbound contacts, we continue to engage in discussions to evaluate the potential commercial partnerships in anticipation of an FDA decision on our Class III PMA application. There can be no assurances that any specific transaction will occur as a result of these discussions. No assurances can be given that the Company will identify any commercialization candidate(s) or complete a transaction.

Manufacturing and Packaging of our Products

The Company’s NORC products are manufactured largely in the United States to our specifications and using our equipment through a contract manufacturing arrangement with an FDA certified contract manufacturer that maintains stringent quality control protocols to assure the uniformity and quality of all of our gauze products. Information on our equipment, the manufacturing process and our partner’s facility has been submitted as part of our PMA submission, which includes the FDA inspection records of the facility. Certain of our adhesive bandage formats designed for the 510k market are manufactured by a separate contractor based in China.

Patents and Trademarks

Our NORC technology is protected through patents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which protection currently runs through 2029. In 2020 and 2021, we filed additional U.S. and International patents that protect the use of our NORC technology in a gel or hydrocolloid formulation.

The Company has registered trademarks for the following product formats:


• | Boo Boo Strips 
--+---------------------
• | The Ultimate Bandage
• | Hemostrips 
• | Nik Fix 

Competition

The wound care products market in the United States is concentrated among large and established companies such as Baxter International, Becton Dickinson & Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson and 3M Company, each of which have greater capital and operational resources than us. Our hemostatic gauze product will directly compete in the gauze markets served by these companies. In this market, competitive factors include product performance, price, breadth of product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support.
