 Product Development. The Company designs and develops substantially all of its products. Company personnel formulate plans and concepts for new products and improvements or modifications of existing products. The Company engages outside consultants to augment its capabilities in areas such as industrial and electronics design.
  
 Major Customers. Sales to three customers, principally of the Vortex-Genie 2 Mixer, represented for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, 15% and 17% of total net revenues, respectively, and 20% and 23% of Benchtop Laboratory Equipment product sales, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Sales of Catalyst Research Instrument products are generally pursuant to a few large orders amounting on average to over $50,000 to a limited number of customers. In fiscal 2018, sales to four customers accounted for 78% of the segment’s sales (13% of total net revenues) and in fiscal 2017 sales to two customers (one of which was a customer in 2018) accounted for 74% of the segment’s sales (19% of total net revenues).
  
  Marketing.
  
 Benchtop Laboratory Equipment. The Company’s Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products sold under the “Genie” brand are generally distributed and marketed through an established network of domestic and overseas laboratory equipment distributors who sell the Company’s products through printed catalogs, websites and sales force.
  
 The Company’s “Torbal” brand products are primarily marketed and sold online, and primarily on a direct basis, with only a few distributors. The Company also markets products through attendance at industry trade shows, trade publication advertising, brochures and catalogs, the Company’s websites, one sales manager and one director of marketing in the U.S., and a consultant in Europe.
  
 In general, due to the reliance on sales through the catalog distribution system, it takes two to three years for a new benchtop laboratory equipment product to begin generating meaningful sales.
  
 Catalyst Research Instruments. The Company’s Catalyst Research Instrument products are sold directly worldwide to universities, government laboratories, and chemical and petrochemical companies through its sales personnel and independent representatives engaged on a commission basis. Its marketing efforts include attendance at various trade shows, Altamira’s website, outside sales representatives, and printed materials.
  
 Bioprocessing Systems. The Company’s Bioprocessing Systems products are currently under development and will be offered both directly and through distribution worldwide to university, industrial, and government laboratories.
  
 Assembly and Production. The Company has an operating facility in Bohemia, New York at which its Benchtop Laboratory Equipment operations are conducted and one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at which its Catalyst Research Instruments operations are conducted. The Company also has a small sales and marketing office in Oradell, New Jersey related to its Torbal division. The Company’s production operations principally involve assembly of components supplied by various domestic and international independent suppliers. The Company has not commenced production of bioprocessing products, but anticipates that its current facilities will be adequate for such purpose, although no assurances can be provided.
  
 Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses.
 
 The Company holds a United States patent which expires in November 2022 on the MagStir Genie®, MultiMagStir Genie®, and Enviro-Genie®, and a patent which expires in January 2029 on a biocompatible bag with integral sensors. The Company has several patent applications pending. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations following the expiration of the patents.

The Company also has several trademark applications pending. No representation can be made that any application will be granted or as to the protection that any existing or future trademark may provide.
  
 The Company has an exclusive license from UMBC with respect to rights and know-how under a patent held by UMBC related to disposable sensor technology, which the Company further sublicenses on an exclusive basis to a German company, and non-exclusive rights held by the Company as it relates to the use of the technology with vessels of sizes ranging from 250 milliliters to 5 liters. Total license fees paid or owed by the Company under this license and expired licenses for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 amounted to $517,000 and $242,100, respectively.
  
 Foreign Sales. The Company’s sales to overseas customers, principally in Asia and Europe, accounted for approximately 40% and 32% of the Company’s net revenues for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Payments are in United States dollars and are therefore not subject to risks of currency fluctuation, foreign duties and customs.
  
 Seasonality. The Company does not consider its business to be seasonal.
  
 Backlog. Backlog for Benchtop Laboratory Equipment products is not a significant factor because this line of products is comprised of standard catalog items requiring lead times which usually are not longer than two weeks. There is no backlog for Bioprocessing Systems. The backlog for Catalyst Research Instrument products as of June 30, 2018 was $509,600, all of which is expected to be filled by June 30, 2019, as compared to a backlog of $89,300 as of June 30, 2017, all of which was filled in fiscal 2018.
