 Navigant Consulting, Inc. (“Navigant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) (NYSE: NCI) is a specialized, global professional services firm that helps clients take control of their future. Navigant’s professionals apply deep industry knowledge, substantive technical expertise, and an enterprising approach to help clients build, manage, and/or protect their business interests. With a focus on markets and clients facing transformational change and significant regulatory or legal pressures, Navigant primarily serves clients in the healthcare, energy, and financial services industries. Across a range of advisory, consulting, outsourcing, and technology/analytics services, we believe our practitioners bring sharp insight that pinpoints opportunities and delivers powerful results.
 We are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1996 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Our executive office is located at 150 North Riverside Plaza, Suite 2100, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Our telephone number is (312) 573-5600. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NCI.” 
 General Development of the Business 
 Our business is organized in three reporting segments — Healthcare, Energy, and Financial Services Advisory and Compliance.  Within these reporting segments, we deliver consulting and advisory services and also provide technology-based solutions, data hosting and processing, and business process management services (which we refer to as Technology, Data & Process services herein) to the respective industries underlying these reporting segments.  We conduct business globally in certain areas across our reporting segments and are strategically focused on offering services to clients facing transformational change and significant regulatory or legal pressures. Since our inception, we have grown through selective acquisitions of businesses (which we consider inorganic growth), recruitment of employees (which we consider organic growth) and investments in technology to complement our consulting skills and enhance our service offerings.  These investments have enhanced or expanded existing expertise, added new services, broadened our geographic reach, and enhanced our market share.
 On August 24, 2018, we completed the previously announced sale of our former Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment and the transaction advisory services practice within our Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment (collectively, “SaleCo”) to Ankura Consulting Group, LLC (“Ankura”). The sale represented a strategic shift in our services and in accordance with the applicable guidance, the results from operations of SaleCo have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
 Our Healthcare segment provides consulting services and business process management services.  Clients of this segment include healthcare providers, payers and life sciences companies.  This segment has grown through a combination of strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and recruitment of senior hires.  Our recruiting efforts within this segment have been focused on building multi-functional globalized consulting teams that allow us to help our clients respond to the most significant issues impacting the healthcare industry today.  Our suite of healthcare consulting services include strategy, physician enterprise, revenue cycle, operational and performance improvement, regulatory and compliance, and product planning and commercialization. In 2014 and 2015 we established our healthcare business process management services through the acquisitions of Cymetrix Corporation and RevenueMed, Inc. In 2018, to further grow our business process management services we launched a revenue-cycle business process management services joint venture, Health Systems Solutions (“HSS”), with Baptist Health South Florida.  We have a 60% financial and controlling interest in HSS and as such we fully consolidate its operations. We believe that our business process management solutions and consulting expertise offers health systems and other providers with end-to-end solutions, a significant depth of industry knowledge, collaboration and integration and, with the increase in size, we provide scalability and leading capabilities.
 Our Energy segment’s professionals provide full lifecycle solutions that help clients transform their businesses in a rapidly changing energy environment, manage complexity, accelerate operational performance, meet compliance requirements and transform their organizations and systems. Clients of this segment include utility and energy companies, government and nongovernmental organizations, large corporations, product manufacturers, and investors. The segment has grown through a combination of investments in hiring, solution development and acquisitions.  These investments have expanded our operations in key markets and geographies and over time have broadened our service offerings to more effectively help our clients respond to and capitalize on the global transformation occurring within the energy sector. We have also grown our benchmarking, data, and research services which now enable us to offer a broad array of market research capabilities (included within our Technology, Data & Process services). Additionally, our November 2016 acquisition of Ecofys Investments B.V. (“Ecofys”), an international consulting firm specializing in renewable energy and sustainability, now operating under the Navigant name, has provided us with a European platform to augment our capabilities in energy policy, climate strategies, energy systems and markets, urban energy, and sustainability services.

Our Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment provides strategic, operational, risk management, investigative and compliance advisory services to clients primarily in the highly-regulated financial services industry, including major financial and insurance institutions. This segment also provides anti-corruption solutions and anti-money laundering consulting, litigation support and tax compliance services to clients in a broad variety of industries. From time to time, clients seek the services of this segment to perform large scale, compliance-oriented engagements. The strategic, operational and risk management services within this segment have largely developed over time through the recruitment of senior hires.  Senior hiring remains a key strategy to drive future growth for this segment.  We have also developed technology tools that enable our professionals to more efficiently identify compliance risks and streamline operational activities for our clients. In 2018, we expanded our client offerings to include managed services activities for our financial services clients.
We maintain international operations across our reporting segments.  We have continued to build our international footprint to facilitate and expand our service offerings to clients outside of the United States (“U.S.”).  As global demand for our services has increased, we have established international offices to provide our clients with on-the-ground resources in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia through hiring and acquisitions. 
 We continue to invest in technology, data and analytics infrastructure, including machine intelligence and robotics process automation abilities, to support our evolving and expanding technology-based service offerings, and to allow us to deliver more scalable solutions to meet the changing demands of our clients.  
 We have supplemented these technology investments with employee-related initiatives to promote innovation and collaboration.  In addition, we have invested in development programs for our client-service professionals designed to improve sales effectiveness and collaboration across the organization as well as with our clients and business partners.  We have also focused on other aspects of employee development, including talent management and mentoring programs.  Collectively, these innovation, collaboration, development and sales initiatives are intended to contribute to the professional development of our employees while enhancing our ability to grow the business organically.
 Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2018, we had 5,952 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees. These FTEs were comprised of the following: 
  
• | Client-service employees (“Client-Service FTE”) (related costs for these employees are recorded as cost of services before reimbursements):
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 1,427 consulting employees (“Consulting FTE”) in businesses that deliver professional services. These individuals record time to client engagements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 3,630 Technology, Data & Process employees (“Technology, Data & Process FTE”) in businesses that are comprised of technology-enabled professional services, including data analytics, business process management services, technology solutions, market research and benchmarking. Of these 3,630 employees, 606 are employees of HSS. While some of these individuals may record time to client engagements (in professional services engagements), many do not record time to specific engagements. Revenue generated by FTEs working on these engagements is generally recognized on a per unit basis. 1,627 of these Technology, Data & Process FTEs were based in India. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-billable employees (“Non-billable FTE”):
--+---------------------------------------------


o | 895 non-billable employees are assigned to administrative and support functions, including office services, corporate functions, centralized analytics and certain cross-practice support functions. The majority of costs related to these employees is recorded in general and administrative expense. Certain costs relating to a central analytics team based in India are allocated to cost of services before reimbursements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we centralized resources previously organized as separate practice functions and leveraged our lower cost India footprint for certain activities. In 2018, 329 of these Non-billable FTEs were based in India. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also had 212 FTE project employees who perform client services on a contractual basis. Project employee levels vary from period to period based on staffing and resource requirements. The majority of costs related to these employees is recorded in cost of services before reimbursements.

Our revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our client-service employees.  As a result, our success depends in large part on attracting, retaining and motivating talented, creative and experienced client-service employees at all levels and across various geographies.  We employ internal recruiters, retain executive search firms, and utilize personal and business contacts. Our client-service employees are drawn from a variety of sources, including the industries we serve, accounting and other consulting organizations, and top-rated colleges and universities. Our client-service employees include, but are not limited to, PhDs, MDs, MBAs, JDs, CPAs, CFEs (certified fraud examiners), engineers, nurses and former government officials. 
 We continue to develop and grow our Technology, Data, & Process services through adding employees to support the businesses using these services.  We recruit, retain, and manage many of our Technology, Data & Process employees differently from our consulting employees.  For example, in our business process management services, we add Technology, Data & Process employees through traditional recruitment, by transitioning client employees to become Navigant employees, and by subcontracting services from our clients.  Our demand for these resources may fluctuate depending on our clients’ needs and our ability to more efficiently perform our services by utilizing technology resources.  By managing these employees with our processes, centralizing their functions in our business centers, and leveraging proprietary technology to enable work streams, we are able to more efficiently and effectively deliver services.  We leverage our Technology, Data and Process employees in our business centers not only to help us better manage our employees across work streams and projects but also to create opportunities for these employees to develop professionally by exposing them to new service areas and possibilities for promotion within the management teams at these locations.
 We seek to retain our employees by offering competitive compensation packages including base and incentive compensation (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits and rewarding careers. We periodically review and adjust, if needed, our employees’ total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives, and benefits) to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our level of performance. In addition to compensation, we promote numerous charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs that not only support our community, but also provide experiences for our employees to promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment. 
 We regularly evaluate employees and their productivity against future demand expectations and historical trends. From time to time, we may reduce or add resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands. We may utilize project employees and engage independent contractors on certain engagements, which allow us to quickly adjust staffing in response to changing demand for our services. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we utilized 109 independent contractors under retainer agreements to provide services to our clients.
 In connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions, our general policy is to obtain non-solicitation covenants from senior and some mid-level employees. Most of these covenants have restrictions that extend 12 months or more beyond the termination of employment. We utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to protect our business interests, which can also reduce the risk of attrition and provide stability to our existing clients, staff and projects. 
 In our consulting businesses, our bill rates or fees charged to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and position of our employees staffed on each matter. We monitor and adjust those bill rates or fees according to then-current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve.  Similarly, pricing for our Technology, Data, & Process services is based upon the complexity of services delivered and markets served.
 Competition 
 The market for our services is highly competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. The market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including general management and information technology consulting firms, strategy firms, global accounting firms, business process and technology solution providers and other local, boutique, regional, national and international consulting firms. Many of these companies are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, the “Big Four” accounting firms (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst & Young and KPMG) are highly competitive in the consulting industry. However, we believe that our industry focus, deep industry and operational expertise, reputation, global business model and broad range of service offerings enable us to compete effectively in the marketplace.

Developing Client Relationships  
 We market our services directly to corporate executives and senior management, corporate counsel, law firms, corporate boards, special committees and governmental agencies. We use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients, including on-site presentations, industry seminars, thought leadership and industry-specific articles. In addition, we have strengthened our market presence by developing our brand name and go-to-market strategy. New engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid-level employees working together across our reporting segments. We seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross-sell service offerings provided by other reporting segments. Clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow-on or complementary services. We have also developed client relationships through the formation of joint ventures, such as HSS discussed above. Our future performance will continue to depend upon our ability to win new engagements, attract and retain employees, develop and continue client relationships and maintain our reputation. 
 We believe our unique mix of deep industry expertise, combined with our scale, global presence, multi-disciplinary professionals and specialized service offerings, positions us to address our clients’ critical business needs. We continue to establish programs to facilitate collaborative product development and marketing efforts, and also to develop new, innovative and repeatable solutions for our clients. 
 Financial Information about our Business Segments
 See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 5 – Segment Information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of total revenues, revenues before reimbursements, segment operating profit and total assets by business segment.  Certain areas within our reporting segments operate globally. For information regarding our total revenues and total assets by geographic region see Note 5 – Segment Information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  For information regarding risks related to our international operations see Item 1A – “Risk Factors.”
How Our Income is Derived 
 Our clients’ demand for our services ultimately drives our revenues and expenses. We derive our revenues from fees on services provided. The most common type of contract through which our revenues are generated is on a time and materials basis.  We also have engagements where fees are a fixed amount (either in total or for a period of time). We may also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fees, which are contingent on the attainment of certain event-based or performance-based contractual milestones or outcomes. We estimate and recognize the revenue from such contingent fees over the period of performance to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Variations in our quarterly or annual revenues and resulting operating profit margins may occur depending on, among other things, our ability to estimate fees associated with contingent outcomes or, in certain contracts, our ability to achieve performance metrics indicative of value provided to the client, and therefore to be recognized in the period. Revenues are also earned on a per unit or subscription basis. Regardless of the terms of our engagements, our ability to earn fees is reliant on the experience and expertise of our client-service employees. 
 Our most significant expense is client-service employee compensation, which includes salaries, incentive compensation, and amortization of sign-on and retention incentive payments, share-based compensation and benefits. Client-service employee compensation is included in cost of services before reimbursable expenses, in addition to technology costs, sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training client-service employees. 
 Our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office-related expenses. Administrative compensation includes salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel that indirectly support client engagements. Office-related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices. Other administrative costs include bad debt expense, marketing, technology, finance and human capital management. 
 Concentration of Revenues
 Revenues earned from our top 20 clients remained relatively steady at 39%, 38% and 37% of our total revenues from continuing operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues during 2018, 2017 or 2016.  For further information on segment concentration see Item 7 - Management, Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results.

Non-U.S. Operations 
 We maintain international operations and have offices outside the U.S. including in countries within Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  No country, other than the U.S., accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues from continuing operations during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries, in the aggregate, represented approximately 8%, or $62.9 million, of our total revenues from continuing operations in 2018 compared to 7%, or $47.7 million, in 2017 and 3%, or $23.4 million, in 2016.  Revenues are allocated among our subsidiaries based on the respective entity or entities employing the personnel deployed on the engagements.  For further geographic information, see Note 5 – Segment Information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
