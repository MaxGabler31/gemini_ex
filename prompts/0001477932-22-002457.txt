As of December 31, 2021, we have seven US patents, two Canadian patents, one Mexican patent, one allowed Brazilian patent and one pending US patent application covering integrated electrical power generation methods and systems. 

The Company intends to sell a mobile electric power system to government, military and commercial vehicle and fleet owners. It intends to commercialize its patents by licensing its thermal technologies and applications to electric motor, pump and vehicle component manufacturers. It may license its mobile electric power system as well. 

Business Description 

Cool Technologies has spent years designing and developing its technologies. The core technologies are:

Thermal Dispersion - patented technologies (totally enclosed heat pipe cooled and radial vent) that deliver liquid-cooled results for rotating equipment, multi-plate clutches, brakes and rotors without the use of liquid. Liquid cooling is the best, most effective cooling system for electric motors, however, it is also the most expensive. Our technologies reduce the cost of rotating equipment by eliminating the active material and, otherwise, extra components that liquid cooling requires. Our technologies also reduce production costs by increasing the power densities of the rotating equipment which enables them to output the same power from a smaller package. 

Mobile Power Generation - a patent pending in-chassis system that outputs electrical power in amounts equal to or greater than skid-mounted generators or tow-behind generators from a smaller, lighter, more efficient package. 

The markets for products utilizing our technology include consumer, industrial and military markets, both in the U.S. and worldwide. Our initial target markets include those involved in moving materials and moving people, such as:


· | Motors/Generators, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Mobile auxiliary power, 
· | Water purification and desalination, 
· | Electric vehicle charging, 
· | Compressors, 
· | Turbines (Wind, Micro), 
· | Bearings, 
· | Electric Vehicles: rail, off-highway, mining, delivery, refuse, 
· | Brakes/rotors/calipers, 
· | Pumps/fans, 
· | Passenger vehicles: autos, RVs, buses, trains, aircraft, 
· | Commercial vehicles: SUV, light trucks, trams, bucket trucks, 
· | Military: boats, Humvees, trucks, aircrafts, and 
· | Marine: boats ranging in size from 30 feet to 120 feet and beyond.

Our Technologies

Our technologies are divided into two distinct but complementary categories: heat dispersion technology and mobile power generation (eMGen).

Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe and Radial Vent Heat Pipe

The Company has developed, designed, prototyped and third party tested Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled (TEHPC) designs. It also owns the patents on the designs. The designs apply to dry pit submersible motors and 650 kVA marine duty generators. 

Our patent portfolio covers the application and integration of our heat pipes into various other cooling schemes for enhanced heat removal in motors (i.e., electric motorcycles, cars and trucks), generators (i.e. e-axles and the eMGen system) and numerous other industrial applications including multi-clutches for vehicles and brakes and rotors for vehicles marine, aviation and military. We believe that our technologies have the potential to deliver power output increases and cost reductions, depending on the machine type or motor/generator size, as follows:


1. | Increase power density of current motor platforms by 20% to 40%,
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Reduce total product cost by 12.5% to 25%, 
3. | Increase motor and generator efficiency by 1% to 2%, and 
4. | Increase motor and generator life. 


We also believe that products produced with our technologies have the potential to deliver operational savings as well, including savings from:


- | reduced maintenance costs, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | the standardization of multiple platforms down to a single platform, 
- | the standardization of drawings and data around existing platforms, 
- | the ability to use standard designs and standard insulation systems versus customization, and 
- | the ability to integrate and produce on existing production lines with no retooling and no additional, or minimal, capital investment.


Testing conducted by independent laboratories showed a 200% increase in horsepower capability for a dry pit submersible pump and a 25 to 35% increase in power density for a 650 kVA generator. 

In 2019, a new Canadian patent covering a Heat Pipe Cooled Wet Rotating Disc Engagement System and a Radial Vent Composite Heat Pipe was added to the Company’s existing patents. It’s a utility patent which is more difficult to circumvent and, therefore, easier to defend. The designation ‘utility patent’ means that the patent covers the Company’s cooling technologies when used in a wide variety of specific applications as opposed to simply covering the cooling method or technology itself. This is an extremely important distinction with regard to defending patents. These applications include electric vehicle motors, standard electric motors, generators, engine hot spots, pistons, ERG (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) coolers and more. Similar patents are pending in other countries as part of the Global PCT patent process.

Our revenue model for the heat dispersion technology is to license the technology in exchange for royalties. Our design and manufacturing experience will be put to use by taking current product in the market, retrofitting with our TEHPC and radial vent heat pipes and handing back to the OEM a third party tested and validated, manufacturable product that increases performance and lowers cost. 

The electric motorcycle industry which includes brands such as Harley Davidson, Zero and others, relies on both air-cooled and liquid-cooled motors. We believe our technology can result in the production of smaller, lighter weight motors as well as cooler motors, batteries and controls. We believe it will also address common performance issues such as overheating which shuts down the motor and forces the rider to stop and let the motor cool. Finally, we believe our wet rotating disc engagement system can cool motorcycle clutches and brakes.


Thermal Technology Target Markets: Generators
---------------------------------------------
Large kilowatt: | prime power 
Stationary: | emergency back-up, UPS systems 
Commercial Mobile: | Electric vehicles and motor- cycles, e-axles, battery management systems
Consumer: | home standby, recreation 
Rental: | mobile + light towers, pumps, compressors 

Mobile Power Generation (eMGen)

The Company’s mobile power generation system enables work trucks to power an in-chassis generator, eliminating the need for some commercial vehicles to tow a mobile generator to a work site. Management believes that there is an unmet demand for on-board, continuous generation of up to 800 kilowatts (kW) of power to remote jobsites, charge electric vehicles and generate emergency power in the event of an outage or disaster. Meetings with Mexican farmers, military personnel and electric vehicle companies along with feedback from international representatives and agents of the Company have confirmed the need for such applications. We offer an in-chassis generator installation kit as a stand-alone (Mobile Generator or eMGen) for third parties and have contracted with Craftsmen Industries to perform domestic installations. It’s likely the Company will also contract with a facility overseas to handle the foreign orders. 

Management, along with key directors, members of the Board of Advisors and the Company’s outside contractors, utilized 2021 to increase eMGen output up to 825 kVA and enhance optional capabilities, specifically water purification, desalination and electric vehicle charging. They met with vendors, determined specifications and design modifications, gathered quotes, generated purchase orders and performed quality control reviews before equipment was shipped. Despite COVID 19 restrictions, they also managed to expand existing business relationships and establish new ones in Mexico, the Middle East, and the USA, specifically the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, state and local disaster preparedness agencies as well as federal and state firefighting agencies. 

The Company has signed international joint ventures in Turkey (Belirti Teknoloji) and Australia (KeyOptions) as well as a strategic alliance with VerdeWatts and FirmGreen. Belirti Teknoloji will market and sell CoolTech’s entire product platform in Southern Europe, the Middle East and some North African nations. KeyOptions will market and sell CoolTech’s entire product platform in Australia and neighboring countries in Southeast Asia.

The Company has also signed an independent agent agreement with H&K Ventures to generate investment funding and revenues from its business relationships in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the US.

As the Company is still pre-revenue, some production funding may be made in conjunction with projects that involve our director Steve Wilburn’s companies’ FirmGreen or VerdeWatts. In the meantime, CoolTech has continued to pursue non-dilutive financing based upon the third-party valuation of the Company’s intellectual property, however, there can be no assurance that financing will be obtained.

As a result of a cross marketing and license agreement the Company signed with FirmGreen (a producer of commercial water systems) and the interest we received from Mexican government officials, we are commercializing our water desalination and purification capability. The Company now offers eMGen 125 water purification and desalination systems capable of producing up to 14,000 gallons of potable water per day as well as delivery if a rolling tank is hitched to the truck. The truck-mounted systems should cleanse contaminated, polluted and wastewater or remove saline from saltwater. The desalination unit should output either clean potable water for drinking and cooking or non-potable water for agricultural or mining use. 

In July 2019, our CEO attended a meeting with senators, federal, local, and Oaxaca state deputies, as well as representatives of state and federal agencies in Villa Alta, Mexico to discuss ways to clean the water in the Atoyac River, which is considered to be one of the most polluted rivers in Mexico. 

Since then, elected officials in the states of Jalisco, Hidalgo and Sonora, Chihuahua and Txlaca have also expressed interest in using the eMGen to treat water from their rivers. The need in Hidalgo is especially urgent. Over 100,000 people were infected with the coronavirus in 2020 due to the contamination of their drinking water. For most states, the primary contaminant is sewage. In Sonora, it’s salt. Both impact drinking water and irrigation.

We expect the license agreement signed with VerdeWatts (a solar panel and energy storage manufacturer) will also act as a catalyst in the development of a no-idle option that will enable the eMGen system to operate solely through battery and solar power without the need to idle the truck’s engine. An eMGen outfitted with a solar or battery-powered no idle system could output clean drinkable water for virtually no cost. 

Mexican interest extends beyond immediate applications. Federal Deputy Efrain Rocha Vega announced in 2020, the Mexican government will also support a Cool Technologies Center of Excellence to help integrate CoolTech’s green energy platform into other areas of the Mexican economy. A Center of Excellence is a shared facility or entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for our eMGen power systems, our mobile water purification and desalination systems and possibly our solar-powered and no-idle technology

The joint venture the Company signed with VerdeWatts and FirmGreen added a new application for the eMGen System: making it an integral part of mobile microgrids. VerdeWatts solar panels and battery storage systems would provide the sustainable energy. eMGen Systems would recharge or back-up the microgrids and simultaneously power FirmGreen water purification and desalination systems. 

The mobile microgrids would interface with existing infrastructure for power, water, wireless communications and healthcare. They would provide or increase resilience during grid outages such as what occurred this past winter in Texas, using clean energy alternatives to mobile fossil fuel generators. The microgrids could also power, light and provide potable water and irrigation for farming villages throughout rural America and the developing world. VerdeWatts has publicly stated it has microgrid projects in Puerto Rico, Chile and Nigeria and that it intends to build mobile medical clinics and emergency command posts powered by eMGen systems.

An application that the Company has demonstrated publicly is truck mounted electric vehicle charging. 

Range anxiety has often been mentioned as a primary reason holding back adoption of electric vehicles. Concomitant with that concern is ‘charging deserts’ - areas without charging infrastructure, primarily rural, less populated, less traveled and/or low income. (https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-dozens-of-startups-leading-the-electric-car-charging-market-2022-20)

The eMGen’s EV charging option helps quickly address those adoption concerns in a very cost-effective way. Mobile charging vehicles don’t require permits or build out of infrastructure which, depending on the type of charging required can cost $300,000 to $400,000. (https://electrek.co/2018/10/16/porsche-taycan-dealers-charging-stations/)

The higher the level and the faster the charge, the more expensive an EV charger is to install. Level 3 chargers cost $120,000 to $260,000 installed on average, according to AlixPartners. Others estimate the cost around $50,000 for a single port for Level 3 stations. In the European Union, a typical 350-kilowatt (kW) charger can cost $150,000, including hardware, installation, and planning.

Actual hardware costs usually total a bit more than 50% of total project costs. The other costs include bringing additional power or utility service to the site. Especially with DC fast chargers, a host site likely will not have enough power available and the local utility may have to upgrade the electrical grid to expand power capacity. Electrical conduit upgrades such as the cost of installing a dedicated 480 volt circuit can average $12,000 to $15,000 according to Future Energy. Plus, an electrical upgrade involves associated expenses including electrical panels, meters to monitor electricity use, or even an additional transformer. 

Construction includes the underground preparation such as boring and trenching as well as concrete pads and cement work for power lines needed to support multiple DC fast chargers. 

Soft costs (anything not including labor and materials) include everything from architectural and engineering fees to legal fees, easement processes, inspections, permits and taxes and insurance. In many locations, securing permits and approvals to build chargers, construct sites, and connect to the electric grid can require months, or even years, of planning. 

One final consideration is that resources including skilled technicians and production capacity for fast charging hardware and high voltage electrical equipment are in short supply. 

Our technology can provide Level 2, DC Fast Charging and even mega charging (up to and including 825 kVA on a medium duty Class 6 truck) and should deliver even more power in the future. Because the system is retrofittable, it can be uninstalled and reinstalled on a larger or newer model truck that generates more torque. More torque is an upgrade to the system as more torque produces more power. 

Our revenue model for an in-chassis mobile electric power generation system is driven by the efforts of partner up-fitters and truck body builders along with regional sales teams and independent representatives as well as strategic alliances and joint ventures. 

We believe that in head-to-head competition with tow behind generators, our mobile generation technology should prove very disruptive. Operators in such markets as the military, utilities and agriculture, to name a few, will be able to work in remote locations without having to tow or drop in a generator. We believe that the reduction in overall weight and size should also deliver significant operating efficiencies and savings to government and work truck fleets. Furthermore, we believe that our new applications will enhance adoption of the eMGen across an even wider range of industries, NGOs and government entities in both first and third world countries. 

Competition 

Heat Dispersion Technologies (Totally Enclosed Heat Pipe Cooled and Radial Vent Heat Pipe) 

Cooling solutions to remove or control heat produced by industrial electric motors, generators and alternators are provided by the manufacturers. Their current best practices are based on technology that’s over 50 years old. They either add a liquid cooling system to the motor or build an extra-large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of their products. 

The Company is not aware of any new alternatives on the market.

Mobile Electric Power (eMGen 30-eMGen 825.8)

The worldwide market for power generation off site spans a broad range. We believe the competitive factors in our markets include but are not limited to:

· | technological innovation and adaptability;
--+-------------------------------------------
· | ease of transport and use; 
· | product quality and safety; 
· | kilowatts output and efficiency; and 
· | product price. 


We believe our primary competition in the mobile generator market will be from well-established companies such as Cummins, Caterpillar Inc., Doosan Group, Wacker Neuson SE, Multi Quip Inc. and Generac Power Systems. All of them offer towable, trailer-mounted generators. Cummins Onan, Harrison Hydra-Gen and Smart Power Systems offer an onboard generator, specifically engineered for mobile emergency vehicle use. 

Portable generators address a need for mobile electric power in the commercial, leisure and residential markets. As outputs tend to range from 1 to 17.5 kilowatts (kW), the competition they provide is only at the lowest end of our power output spectrum. Onan, Honda and Kohler are among the well-established brand names. 

A standard option that can be ordered when purchasing a truck is a power take-off or PTO. PTOs are mounted to a truck’s drivetrain and redirect engine power to operate onboard equipment. Integrated power systems use the PTO to run an alternating current generator. Cool Tech has the capability to power the generator directly from the drivetrain or from a PTO.

Real Power from Contour Hardening, Inc. offers alternating current (AC) power systems driven by a PTO. System voltages range from 15 to 180 kVA. Those under 60 kW retrofit under the beds of class 3 to 5 diesel trucks. Systems larger than 100 kW require Class 6 or 8 diesel trucks and a side mount. An important difference between the Real Power and the eMGen systems is that the eMGen can generate up to 125 kW on class 3 to 5 trucks and it can operate independently from the transmission.

Modular integrated systems offer varying combinations of air compressors, welders, hydraulics and generators. Vanair Manufacturing, Inc’s Underdeck uses a PTO to power various combinations and output from 6.6 to 25 kilowatts. 

HIPPO Multipower packages hydraulic, air, electric and welding into a single unit. Outputs range from 5.2 to 9 kW. The Enpak from Miller Electric Manufacturing Company offers the same package powered by a separate diesel engine that exports 7 kW of power.

Many electric vehicles (“EV”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEV”) can use excess battery capacity to provide exportable power with no idling. Ford’s 2021 hybrid F-150 pickup truck exports 2.4 to 9.6 kilowatts of power. Odyne Systems, LLC, manufactures hybrid systems for medium and heavy-duty work trucks over 14,000 pounds. The systems export 6 to 18 kW of AC power.

Another way EV and PHEV can power onboard equipment is through an ePTO or electric power take-off which is essentially a battery-powered version of a PTO. Terex’s Corporation’s hybrid-electric system uses an ePTO to export up to 3.8 kW of power. In July of 2018, Cummins, Inc. acquired Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. a designer and producer of PHEV and EV drivetrain systems that offered an exportable power option that provides 50 to 200 kW of grid-synchronized power. The drive system made by First Priority Greenfleet exports up to 120 kW of synchronized power. 

Allison Transmission and a partner company combine a generator and transmission into a single casing to produce 30 to 125 kW of electric power.

While both the eMGen and the Allison Transmission are retrofittable, there are important differences. The Allison is limited to new vehicles that incorporate its 3,000 and 4,000 Series transmissions. The eMGen can produce up to 125 kW on an 8,000 pound as opposed to a 40,000-pound vehicle. Also, the eMGen’s power is produced independently from the transmission, consequently, the truck can still operate if the generator stops working. 

The company’s electrification portfolio also includes the Transmission Integral Generator which provides up to 120kW of electrical power to reduce reliance on traditional towable generators

In January 2022, Oshkosh Defense, a wholly owned subsidiary of Oshkosh Corporation, demonstrated the first-ever silent drive hybrid-electric Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), the JLTV provides export power capacity of up to 115kW.

Other companies use a vehicle’s engine to charge on-board batteries, which then run the generator when the vehicle is stopped. Output tends to be less than 50 kW and lithium-ion batteries typically power the system. The batteries have limited runtimes and a shorter lifespan than acid batteries. In addition, they must be cooled to operate properly. As an example, Altec Inc’s. Jobsite Energy Management System provides up to 4 kW of exportable power.

Aura Systems, Inc. and Mobile Electric Power Solutions, Inc. (“MEPS”) use a vehicle engine’s drive belt to turn a generator. MEPS provides up to 15 kW of AC power whereas Aura Systems generates up to 20 kW of direct current (DC) or AC power. Other MEPS engine or transmission-based electrical power take-off systems output small amounts in the range of 7 kW or 15 kW when two generators are aligned. 

CoolTech’s Mobile Generation system can also provide Level 2 and Level 3 DC Fast Charging (up to and including 350 kVA on a Class 7, 13 liter truck). ‘Levels’ indicate the charging power. The higher the level, the higher the power. More power equals shorter charging times. Level 2 is typically 240 volt AC (alternating current) power. Level 3 relies on 480 volt DC (direct current) power. Most Level 3 chargers provide an 80% charge in 30 minutes. 

The Company expects to deliver even more power in the future. That’s because the system is retrofittable. It can be uninstalled and reinstalled on a larger truck that generates more torque. 

4Real Power uses a PTO driven generator to output 70 kW of power for Level 3 DC fast charging. Lightning Mobile puts a rechargeable package into a vehicle or trailer to deliver DC fast charging at up to 80 kW and, optionally, Level 2 AC charging at up to 19.2 kW. In China, vans operated by Nio store about 200 kilowatt hours (kWh) for vehicle charging. The Blink Mobile Emergency Charger outputs up to 9.6 kW which equates to about 1 mile of charge per minute. 

The Mobi EV Charger is essentially batteries on wheels with a joystick drive system. The Level 2 fast charger is equipped with an 80-kWh battery. SparkCharge’s transportable fast-charging system incorporates a battery module that provides up to 20 kW of power.

Another variation on mobile charging relies on a self-contained unit that is dropped into place. EV Safe Charge offers a temporary Level 2 and DC fast charging systems delivered to locations on demand. Depending upon on-site capabilities, chargers are powered either through existing power at the location, solar panels, or self-contained generating systems. The EV ARC from Beam Global uses a solar array to export up to 4.3 kW of power. It provides Level 2 charging to as many as 6 EVs at a time.

Both the battery-on-wheels and the delivery and drop-off systems aim to address the problems with permitting, construction and electrical infrastructure upgrades common to permanent charging installations.

We believe our proprietary technology is so powerful, innovative, versatile, easy to use and offers very attractive price points that we can compete in and even disrupt the remote power generation market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition.

Equipment

As a company that intends to commercialize or license its proprietary technology for others to install, manufacture and/or distribute, our equipment needs are project specific and temporary. We do not intend to purchase any production equipment to implement our business operations, but instead we will rent, lease or outsource as needed.
Manufacturing

We do not plan to manufacture in-house. The Company works with Craftsmen Industries utilizing its assets and system integrators to upfit our Mobile Generation technology. For our thermal technologies, the Company plans to rely on product development agreements with manufacturers who will then pay a license or royalty per unit. We anticipate that such agreements will delineate the respective intellectual property owned by both companies, describe the goal of the testing to verify the savings and value to a particular company, the equipment to be modified, the criteria that constitutes successful testing, how and where the tests will be conducted and the next steps to be taken in the event of successful testing. 
Suppliers

For mobile power generation, the required software and its vehicle integration were supplied by a third party provider of engineering services along with partner truck up-fitter and others to be named later.

Production level quantities of system components will be handled by at least three suppliers. 

For the thermal technology applications in electric motors, a single supplier will provide the heat pipes and mechanical structure, which combine to make the heat exchangers. We will coordinate with them to combine our thermal technology with their technology in the creation of heat exchangers. 

For dry pit submersibles (a type of submersible pump which can also operate in a dry environment), we intend to purchase the wound stator and the rotor-shaft from one of the largest electric motor manufacturers in the world. We intend to purchase the fully-machined castings from an American company and rely on assembly and testing by another corporation based in the USA. 

As of April 5, 2022, we have not signed formal agreements with any suppliers.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Currently, we have no licenses or contractual rights in place to protect our technology and intellectual property, only patents or patents pending. 

As of December 31, 2021, we have seven US patents, two Canadian patents, one Mexican patent, one allowed Brazilian patent and one pending US patent application covering integrated electrical power generation methods and systems. In addition, we have applied for and received trademarks for an acronym for one of our technologies: “TEHPC” and “eMGen” which will function as the brand name for CoolTech’s Mobile Power Generation System.

Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may also rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. 

We strive to protect such proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. The Company has a policy of not disclosing its patent applications in order to protect the underlying technology.

Government and Industry Regulation

We intend to conduct business worldwide and, therefore, we must comply with local, state, federal, and international regulations, both in operations and for our products. 

As a company, we do not plan to manufacture any of our products. Therefore, the government regulations we will be subject to will be limited to storage and involve rotating the shafts of stored electric motors on a regular basis.

Applicable laws and regulations include those governing, among other things, the handling, storage and transportation of materials and products as well as noise and employee safety. 

In addition, some of our products are subject to various laws and regulations relating to, among other things, emissions and fuel requirements. 

Accordingly, we may be required or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product or environmental safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications.

Although we believe that our operations and products are in material compliance with current applicable regulations noted within this section, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. New regulations could also require our licensees to redesign their products which could cause us to redesign our technologies which, consequently, could affect market growth for our products.

As our thermal technologies are incorporated in existing motors, generators and other manufactured products that are already subject to regulation. The regulatory burden will fall on the original equipment manufacturers that license our technology. 


12


The Company adds a mobile power generation system to Class 3-8 work trucks. In addition to an existing generator incorporating our thermal technology, the gearing system will incorporate our thermal technology as well. The vehicle and drive train operate normally in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications. No regulations are violated or exceeded. Nonetheless, in some markets, the Company will have to certify that it meets federal, state or local noise and emission regulations. 

Our designs comply with current EPA emission standards, and we believe they will comply with future requirements. 

No original vehicle parts will be significantly modified in the retrofitting process. There will be some additional parts (generator, touchscreens, software, sensors and controls) added, but these parts will not change how the vehicle operates in any way. The drive train will operate according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Therefore, we believe that the original warranty will remain in effect, and we do not believe that the conversion will violate the Magnuson-Moss Act.

The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law that protects consumers by barring a vehicle manufacturer from voiding the warranty on a vehicle due to an aftermarket part unless the manufacturer can prove that the aftermarket part caused or contributed to the failure in the vehicle. The Company will warranty the eMGen System with an industry standard warranty. All of our other components (generator, human machine interface, software, controller/sensors) will be warranted by their respective manufacturers.

The Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) is charged with writing and enforcing safety and fuel economy standards for motor vehicles through their Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These standards require manufacturers to design their electrically powered vehicles so that, in the event of a crash, the electrical energy storage, conversion, and traction systems are either electrically isolated from the vehicle’s chassis, or their voltage is below specified levels considered safe from electric shock hazards. Our planned no-idle version of our Mobile Generation system will be designed to meet or exceed these requirements. 

Optional components such as solar panels, batteries, water purification or desalination systems will be supplied and warrantied by their manufacturers

In addition, the total weight of the additional components should remain within the vehicle’s gross vehicle weight rating. As a result, we believe that our retrofits will comply with federal and state transportation regulations.

While we do not create and market our products around government subsidies and tax incentives, a class 3 to 5 eMGen truck equipped with a charger can provide a Level II charge to one or more electric vehicles. Our 200 kVA truck will provide Level III DC fast charging and a medium duty class 6 truck (Ford F-650) can power what is informally known as a mega-charger for vehicles like the Porsche Taycan or Tesla - all from the truck bed. Assuming the eMGen truck qualifies as a charging station almost every state and a number of municipalities and utilities offer grants, rebates, tax credits, or other incentives for electric vehicle charging stations. 

If we fulfill all elements of our business plan, we will have to prepare for, understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our products will have to comply with the new Euro VII emission standards that are expected to go into effect in the European Union in 2022, as well as the standards in other international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Russia, India, and China that are becoming more stringent. 

Employees

As of April 5, 2022, we had two full time employees, one full time consultant and four part-time contractors. We hope to hire additional employees, on an as-needed basis, subject to sufficient funding, as products and services are developed.
