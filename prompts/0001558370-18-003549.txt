      Prior to December 20, 2017, we operated a Nutritional Supplements segment.  On December 20, 2017, we completed the divestiture of the Nutritional Supplements segment through the sale of Healthy Directions LLC and its subsidiaries to Direct Digital, LLC.  Following the sale, we no longer consolidate our former Nutritional Supplements segment’s operating results.  The Nutritional Supplements segment’s operating results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. We have reallocated corporate overhead expenses to our continuing operating segments that were previously allocated to our former Nutritional Supplements segment. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.  Discontinued operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers only to our discontinued Nutritional Supplements segment’s operations.
     For more segment and geographic information concerning our net sales revenue, long-lived assets and operating income, refer to Note 19 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
     Our Strategic Initiatives 
     In fiscal 2015, we launched a transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities.  This strategy drives our decisions on where we will operate and how we will achieve our goals in markets around the world.  The overall design of our business and organizational plan is intended to create sustainable and profitable growth and improve organizational capability.  This strategy encompasses the following initiatives: 
     Invest in our core businesses 
 We have developed a portfolio of brands that are market leaders or have a path to grow their market position in attractive categories.  This currently includes seven Leadership Brands: OXO, Honeywell, 

 
  3

 
Braun, PUR, Hydro Flask, Vicks, and Hot Tools.  We continue to invest behind these Leadership Brands, which are our most productive brands, and which we believe have the best prospects for long-term profitable growth.  Our Leadership Brands represented approximately 77% of net sales revenue from continuing operations during fiscal 2018.  We believe that strategic investment in new products, go-to-market plans and marketing activities will continue to accelerate the organic growth of these brands.  
     Strategic, disciplined mergers and acquisitions 
 We are continually looking for new businesses and opportunities to expand in categories and geographies where we believe we have critical mass and can develop or sustain a competitive advantage.  We will also increase our brand reach through new licensing opportunities when and where it makes sense.  We frequently assess our portfolio of products and businesses to ensure each has a role to support our long-term plans. 
     Invest in consumer-centric innovation 
 We have a long history of developing or acquiring new technologies, new products that improve consumers’ lives and new designs to differentiate our products from competitors. We continue to focus on innovation, both in our core categories and product adjacencies.  We also focus on initiatives that create commercial value for existing products in order to increase their appeal and accelerate their organic growth.  Consumer shopping preferences and behaviors have transformed the retail landscape from in-store to omni-channel purchasing experiences.  As the retail consumer evolves, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities and operational capacity to meet the omni-channel consumers’ needs. 
     Upgrade our organization and people systems 
 We believe our employees are our most valuable assets.  Attracting, retaining and developing talent is a key focus to ensure we can continue to deliver strong business results.  
     Best in class shared services 
 We have developed a quality, diversified base of suppliers in North America, China and Mexico.  Through our shared service structure, we strive to improve our existing supplier base and infrastructure, develop new manufacturing partners, leverage scale, reduce lead times and apply best practices to ensure our products are innovative, on time, on cost and on quality.  We also continue to invest in our distribution center capabilities and information technology systems while applying discipline and best practices to leverage scale and achieve supply chain excellence.
     Attack waste 
 We continue to adopt more efficient and effective approaches to managing people, teams and operations to best respond to today’s complex business environment.  We believe that combining the best people and practices with the right technology provides a foundation for profitable growth.  We promote a culture of attacking waste to improve the quality of our products and services, reduce costs and enhance our capacity to handle increased volume in order to exceed the expectations of our customers and consumers.  
     Asset efficiency and shareholder friendly policies 
 As we manage our businesses for long-term growth and success in the marketplace, we are also looking to manage our overall base of assets and capital structure to increase shareholder value.  We focus on maximizing cash flow and return on investment, controlling our costs, increasing the efficiency of the capital we deploy, and optimizing working capital.  We also seek to invest in accretive and strategic acquisitions and, where appropriate, provide a return of capital to shareholders.

      Our Trademarks 
     We sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties.  We also market products under a number of trademarks that we own.  We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world.  Through our favorable partnerships with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks.  
     The Beauty and Health & Home segments depend upon the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue.  New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors.  The licensors must also approve the product packaging.  Many of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties, meet minimum sales volumes and some require us to make minimum levels of advertising expenditures.
     The following table lists some of our key trademarks by segment: 
    
Segment | Owned | Licensed 
Housewares | OXO, Good Grips, Hydro Flask, Soft Works, OXO tot | 
Health & Home | PUR | Honeywell , Braun, Vicks
Beauty | Hot Tools, Brut, Pert, Sure, Infusium, Pro Beauty Tools | Revlon, Bed Head 

      Patents and Other Intellectual Property

 Sales and Marketing 
     We currently market our products in approximately 87 countries throughout the world. Sales within the United States comprised approximately 79% of total net sales revenue in both fiscal 2018 and 2017 and 78% in fiscal 2016.  Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers.  We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and, in many instances, produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases.  We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff.  These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products.      Research and Development
 Our research and development activities focus on new, differentiated and innovative products designed to drive sustained organic growth.  We continually invest to strengthen our product design and research and development capabilities, including extensive study to gain consumer insight.  We incurred total research and development expenses of $13.5, $11.8 and $11.6 million during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.       Manufacturing and Distribution 
     We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China and Mexico, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Beauty appliances and accessories, Housewares, Healthcare, Water Filtration, and Home Environment product categories.  The North American region of the grooming, skin and hair care category of the Beauty segment source most of their products from U.S. manufacturers.  For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, finished goods manufactured by vendors in the Far East comprised approximately 74%, 71% and 70%, respectively, of total finished goods purchased. 
     In total, we occupy approximately 3,552,728 square feet of owned and leased distribution space in various locations to support our operations.  These facilities include a 1,200,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, and a 1,300,000 square foot distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution. 
     Customers
     Sales to Walmart, Inc. (including its worldwide affiliates) accounted for approximately 15%, 16% and 18% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Sales to Amazon.com Inc. accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2018.  No other customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales revenue during those fiscal years.  Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016.       Order Backlog  
     When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame.  As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels.

 Seasonality 
     SEASONALITY AS A PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL NET SALES REVENUE

 | Fiscal Years Ended | 
 | the Last Day of February, | 
Fiscal Quarter Ended | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016 | 
May | | 22.0 | % | 22.2 | % | 22.0 | %
August | | 23.3 | % | 23.8 | % | 23.8 | %
November | | 28.4 | % | 29.3 | % | 29.3 | %
February | | 26.2 | % | 24.7 | % | 25.0 | %

      Our sales are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns.  Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year.  
     Competitive Conditions 
     We sell our products in markets that are very competitive and mature.  Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.  We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our Far East manufacturers.  We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing activities, as well as an extensive sales force in order to build awareness and to encourage new consumers to try our brands and products.  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.  We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a differentiated value proposition.
     The following table summarizes our primary competitors by business segment:
    
Segment | Competitor 
Housewares | Lifetime Brands, Inc. (KitchenAid), Newell Brands Inc., Simple Human LLC, Yeti Holdings, Inc. (Yeti), Can't Live Without It, Inc. (S'well) 
Health & Home | Exergen Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Crane Engineering, Newell Brands, Inc., Lasko Products, LLC., The Clorox Company (Brita), Zero Technologies, LLC.
Beauty | Conair, Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. (Remington), Newell Brands, Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever N.V., Colgate-Palmolive Company 

      Governmental, Regulatory and Environmental Matters 
     Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions’ environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  Many of the products we sell are subject to a number of product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions.  These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification and labeling requirements. 
     Additionally, an emerging trend with both governments and our retail customers is to prescribe public and private social accountability reporting requirements regarding our worldwide business activities.  In our product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required.  Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting and reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors, in addition to evaluating the risks of human trafficking and slavery.

 We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements.  Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, nor do we expect it to do so in the foreseeable future.  Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates. 
     Employees 
     As of February 28, 2018, we employed approximately 1,489 full-time employees worldwide.  We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal employees as needed.  None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Certain of our employees in Europe are covered by collective arrangements in accordance with local practice.  We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees.       Available Information
