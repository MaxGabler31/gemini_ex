ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Corporation
General
The Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") is a corporate agency and instrumentality of the United States ("U.S.") that was created in 1933 by federal legislation in response to a proposal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  TVA was created to, among other things, improve navigation on the Tennessee River, reduce the damage from destructive flood waters within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, further the economic development of TVA's service area in the southeastern U.S., and sell the electricity generated at the facilities TVA operates. Today, TVA operates the nation's largest public power system and supplies power to a population of approximately 10 million people.
TVA also manages the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and certain shorelines to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, and affordable and reliable electricity.  Consistent with these primary purposes, TVA also manages the river system and public lands to provide recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, cultural and natural resource protection, and economic development.  TVA performs these management duties in cooperation with other federal and state agencies that have jurisdiction and authority over certain aspects of the river system.  In addition, the TVA Board of Directors ("TVA Board") has established two councils — the Regional Resource Stewardship Council and the Regional Energy Resource Council — to advise TVA on its stewardship activities in the Tennessee Valley and its energy resource activities.
Initially, all TVA operations were funded by federal appropriations.  Direct appropriations for the TVA power program ended in 1959, and appropriations for TVA's stewardship, economic development, and multipurpose activities ended in 1999.   Since 1999, TVA has funded all of its operations almost entirely from the sale of electricity and power system financings. TVA's power system financings consist primarily of the sale of bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness (collectively, "Bonds") and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements.  As a wholly-owned government corporation, TVA is not authorized to issue equity securities.
TVA's Mission of Service
TVA was built for the people, created by federal legislation, and charged with a unique mission - to improve the quality of life in a seven-state region through the integrated management of the region's resources. TVA's mission focuses on three key areas:
•Energy — Delivering reliable, low cost, clean energy;
•Environment — Caring for the region's natural resources; and
•Economic Development — Creating sustainable economic growth.
TVA's Strategic Priorities
While TVA's mission has not changed since it was established in 1933, the climate in which TVA operates continues to evolve. To continue to deliver its mission of service while evolving for future success, TVA must realize five strategic priorities:
•Powerful Partnerships — Promoting progress through the shared success of TVA's customers and stakeholders;
•People Advantage — Amplifying the energy, passion, and creativity within each TVA employee;
•Operational Excellence — Building on TVA's best-in-class reputation for reliable service and competitively priced power;
•Igniting Innovation — Pursuing innovative solutions for TVA and its customers and communities; and
•Financial Strength — Investing in the future, while keeping energy costs as low as possible.
TVA's Strategic Financial Plan
TVA developed the Strategic Financial Plan in order to help achieve its strategic priorities and mission. TVA's Strategic Financial Plan, which extends from 2020 through 2030, is flexible in aligning customer preferences and TVA's mission while at the same time establishing a long-term forecast of financial results. Key focus areas of the Strategic Financial Plan include maintaining flat base rates, stabilizing debt, establishing alignment between the length of LPC contracts and TVA's long-term commitments, driving efficiencies into the business, and advancing the public power model. As TVA executes the plan, key 

assumptions and focus areas may change.
Service Area
TVA's service area, the area in which it sells power, is defined by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended ("TVA Act"). TVA supplies power in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, and southwestern Kentucky, and in portions of northern Georgia, western North Carolina, and southwestern Virginia. Under the TVA Act, subject to certain minor exceptions, TVA may not, without the enactment of authorizing federal legislation, enter into contracts that would have the effect of making it, or the wholesale customers that distribute TVA power ("local power company customers" or "LPCs"), a source of power supply outside the area for which TVA or its LPCs were the primary source of power supply on July 1, 1957. This provision is referred to as the "fence" because it bounds TVA's sales activities, essentially limiting TVA to power sales within a defined service area.
Note
In addition to the locations above, TVA owns approximately 1 MW of solar capability among 13 solar installations across the Tennessee Valley region with seven installations in Tennessee, two in Alabama, two in Mississippi, one in Virginia, and one in Kentucky. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources for a description of all of TVA's power supply resources.
In addition, the Federal Power Act ("FPA") includes a provision that helps protect TVA's ability to sell power within its service area.  This provision, called the "anti-cherrypicking" provision, prevents the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") from ordering TVA to provide access to its transmission lines to others to deliver power to customers within TVA's defined service area.  As a result, the anti-cherrypicking provision reduces TVA's exposure to loss of its customers. However, there have been some efforts to circumvent the anti-cherrypicking provision, and the protection of the provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future. See Competition, Item 1A, Risk Factors — Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks — TVA may lose its protected service territory, Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Legislative and Regulatory Matters, and Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Challenge to Anti-Cherrypicking Amendment. 

    In 2022, the revenues generated from TVA's electricity sales were $12.4 billion and accounted for virtually all of TVA's revenues. See Note 17 — Revenue for details regarding revenues by state for each of the last three years.
Customers
TVA is primarily a wholesaler of power, selling power to LPCs that then resell power to their customers at retail rates.  TVA's LPCs consist of (1) municipalities and other local government entities ("municipalities") and (2) customer-owned entities ("cooperatives").  These municipalities and cooperatives operate public power electric systems whose primary purpose is not to make a profit but to supply electricity to the general public or the cooperatives' members.  TVA also sells power directly to certain end-use customers, primarily large commercial and industrial loads and federal agencies with loads larger than 5,000 kilowatts ("kW"). Whether TVA or an LPC serves a new power customer is determined by the applicable TVA-LPC wholesale power contract. Each contract contains a formula that balances the size of the LPC and the amount of any TVA infrastructure investment to determine which party is entitled to serve the new customer.  In addition, power in excess of the needs of the TVA system may, where consistent with the provisions of the TVA Act, be sold under exchange power arrangements with other specific electric systems. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Revenues and Note 17 — Revenue for details regarding operating revenues for each of the last three years.
Local Power Company Customers
Revenues from LPCs accounted for approximately 90 percent of TVA's total operating revenues for 2022.  TVA had wholesale power contracts with 153 LPCs at September 30, 2022. Each of these contracts requires the LPC to purchase from TVA all of the electric power required for service to the LPC's customers; however, Power Supply Flexibility Agreements available to LPCs that have executed long-term contracts with TVA allow LPCs to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. LPCs purchase power under contracts with terms of five or 20 years to terminate. 
TVA's two largest LPCs — Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division ("MLGW") and Nashville Electric Service ("NES") — have contracts with a five-year and a 20-year termination notice period, respectively.  Sales to MLGW and NES accounted for nine percent and eight percent, respectively, of TVA's total operating revenues for 2022. Certain LPCs, including MLGW, are evaluating options for future energy choices.
TVA and LPCs continue to work together to meet the changing needs of consumers around the Tennessee Valley. TVA has a Partnership Agreement option that better aligns the length of LPC power contracts with TVA's long-term commitments. Under the partnership arrangement, the LPC power contracts automatically renew each year and have a 20-year termination notice. The partnership arrangements can be terminated under certain circumstances, including TVA's failure to limit rate increases as provided for in the agreements going forward. Participating LPCs receive benefits including a 3.1 percent wholesale bill credit in exchange for their long-term commitment, which enables TVA to recover its long-term financial commitments over a commensurate period. TVA has provided participating LPCs a flexibility option, named Generation Flexibility, that allows them to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. As of November 14, 2022, 147 LPCs had signed the Partnership Agreement with TVA, and 80 LPCs had signed a Power Supply Flexibility Agreement.
The power contracts between TVA and LPCs provide for the purchase of power by LPCs at the wholesale rates established by the TVA Board.  Under the TVA Act, the TVA Board is authorized to regulate LPCs to carry out the purposes of the TVA Act through contract terms and conditions as well as through rules and regulations. TVA regulates LPCs primarily through the provisions of TVA's wholesale power contracts.  All of the power contracts between TVA and the LPCs require that power purchased from TVA be sold and distributed to the ultimate consumer without discrimination among consumers of the same class and prohibit direct or indirect discriminatory rates, rebates, or other special concessions.  In addition, there are a number of wholesale power contract provisions through which TVA seeks to ensure that the electric system revenues of the LPCs are used only for electric system purposes.  Furthermore, almost all of these contracts specify the resale rates and charges at which the LPC must resell TVA power to its customers.  These rates are revised from time to time, subject to TVA approval, to reflect changes in costs, including changes in the wholesale cost of power.  
    TVA also regulates LPC policies for customer deposits, termination of service for non-payment, information to consumers, and billing through a service practice policy framework. TVA's regulatory framework provides for consistent regulatory policy for ratepayers across the Tennessee Valley, while recognizing local considerations. The regulatory provisions in TVA's wholesale power contracts are designed to carry out the objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective of providing for an adequate supply of power at the lowest feasible rates. See Rates — Rate Methodology below.
Other Customers
Revenues from directly served industrial customers accounted for approximately seven percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2022.  Contracts with these customers are subject to termination by the customer or TVA upon a minimum notice period that varies according to a number of factors, including the customer's contract demand and the period of time service has been provided. TVA also serves seven federal customers, including U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") facilities and military installations, which accounted for approximately one percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2022.
Other Revenue
Other revenue consists primarily of wheeling and network transmission charges, sales of steam that is a by-product of power production, delivery point charges for interconnection points between TVA and the customer, Renewable Energy Certificate ("REC") sales, and certain other minor items. Other revenue accounted for approximately one percent of TVA's total operating revenues in 2022. 
Rates
Rate Authority
    The TVA Act gives the TVA Board sole responsibility for establishing the rates TVA charges for power. These rates are not subject to judicial review or to review or approval by any state or other federal regulatory body. Under the TVA Act, TVA is required to charge rates for power that will produce gross revenues sufficient to provide funds for:
•Operation, maintenance, and administration of its power system;
•Payments to states and counties in lieu of taxes ("tax equivalents");
•Debt service on outstanding indebtedness; 
•Payments to the United States Department of the Treasury ("U.S. Treasury") in repayment of and as a return on the government's appropriation investment in TVA's power facilities (the "Power Program Appropriation Investment"); and
•Such additional margin as the TVA Board may consider desirable for investment in power system assets, retirement of outstanding Bonds in advance of their maturity, additional reduction of the Power Program Appropriation Investment, and other purposes connected with TVA's power business, having due regard for the primary objectives of the TVA Act, including the objective that power shall be sold at rates as low as are feasible.  See Note 22 — Related Parties.
    TVA fulfilled its requirement to repay $1.0 billion of the Power Program Appropriation Investment in 2014; therefore, the repayment of this amount is no longer a component of rate setting.
Rate Methodology
    TVA uses a seasonal time of use wholesale rate structure comprised of base demand and energy rates, a fuel rate, and a grid access charge ("GAC"). In setting the base rates, TVA uses a debt-service coverage ("DSC") methodology to derive annual revenue requirements in a manner similar to that used by other public power entities that also use the DSC rate methodology. Under the DSC methodology, rates are calculated so that an entity will be able to cover its operating costs and to satisfy its obligations to pay principal and interest on debt, plus an additional margin. This ratemaking approach is particularly suitable for use by entities financed primarily, if not entirely, by debt, such as TVA, and helps ensure that TVA produces gross revenues sufficient to fund requirements specified in the TVA Act listed under Rate Authority above.
    TVA recovers fuel costs and tax equivalent payments associated with fuel cost adjustments through a monthly rate reflecting the forecasted costs of fuel. Fuel costs are allocated to three groups of customers: (1) Standard Service (residential and small commercial customers), (2) large general service customers with contract demands greater than 5 megawatts ("MW"), and (3) large manufacturing customers with contract demands greater than 5 MW. Fuel costs are allocated to these three classes of customers in relation to their hourly loads and TVA's hourly incremental dispatch cost. Total monthly fuel costs include costs for natural gas, fuel oil, coal, purchased power, emission allowances, nuclear fuel, and other fuel-related commodities as well as realized gains and losses on derivatives purchased to hedge the costs of such commodities.
    TVA's rate structure includes a focus on TVA's long-term pricing by aligning rates with underlying cost drivers and by sending pricing signals, while maintaining competitive industrial rates and keeping residential rates affordable. The GAC better recovers fixed costs and the pricing approach more accurately reflects the wholesale cost of energy and recognizes the value of the grid's reliability and associated fixed costs. TVA's modernized approach to pricing provides bill stability while maintaining reliability and fairness for all TVA's customers. TVA will continue to collaborate with LPCs and directly served industries as necessary to ensure alignment with this approach.
Power Supply and Load Management Resources
General
TVA seeks to balance production capabilities with power supply requirements by promoting the conservation and efficient use of electricity and, when necessary, buying, building, or leasing assets or entering into power purchase agreements ("PPAs").  TVA also seeks to employ a diverse mix of energy generating sources and works toward obtaining greater amounts of its power supply from clean (low or zero carbon-emitting) resources.
TVA is making investments in its generating portfolio to modernize the fleet while also allowing TVA to maintain competitive rates and high reliability and work toward carbon emission reductions. As TVA continues to evaluate the impact of retiring its coal-fired fleet by 2035, it is also evaluating adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy to maintain reliability, such as the ongoing projects at TVA’s Paradise and Colbert sites. In addition, TVA is committed to investing in the future of nuclear with the evaluation of emerging advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors ("SMRs"). TVA is also implementing the Hydro Life Extension Program with a focus on improving the availability and flexibility of the hydroelectric fleet. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("Inflation Reduction Act") was signed into law, which makes certain tax-exempt entities, including TVA, eligible for a direct-pay option for certain tax credits that encourage investment in clean energy, in some circumstances. TVA is currently evaluating the Inflation Reduction Act to determine whether it will be able to benefit from any of these tax credits for related eligible investments. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives — Optimum Energy Portfolio.
In addition, an automated energy exchange platform that facilitates more short-term power exchanges took effect in 2022. The energy exchange will be an enhancement to the existing market. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Automated Energy Exchange Platform.
Power generating facilities operated by TVA at September 30, 2022, included three nuclear sites, 17 natural gas and/or oil-fired sites, five coal-fired sites, 29 conventional hydroelectric sites, one pumped-storage hydroelectric site, one diesel generator site, and 13 solar installations. See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties — Net Capability for a discussion of the units at these facilities.  TVA also acquires power under PPAs of varying durations, including short-term contracts of less than 24-hours in duration. See Power Purchase and Other Agreements below.
    The following table shows TVA's generation and purchased power by generating source as a percentage of all electric power generated and purchased (based on kilowatt hours ("kWh")) for the periods indicated:

Total Power Supply by Generating SourceFor the years ended September 30
Generation Resource(1) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Nuclear | 39% | 41% | 42% 
Natural gas and/or oil-fired | 22% | 21% | 22% 
Coal-fired | 13% | 15% | 13% 
Hydroelectric | 8% | 10% | 10% 
Purchased power | 18% | 13% | 13% 

Note
(1) TVA's non-hydro renewable resources from TVA facilities are less than one percent for all periods shown, and therefore are not represented on the table above. Purchased power contains the majority of non-hydro renewable energy supply. TVA sells the RECs resulting from some of its purchased power to certain customers. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Renewable Power Purchase Agreements.
While TVA continues down the path of reducing power generation from carbon-emitting sources, there will be fluctuations in usage due to electricity demands. Also, TVA continues to make operational decisions to keep the system reliable and to deliver low-cost energy.
Nuclear
At September 30, 2022, TVA had three nuclear sites consisting of seven units in operation.  The units at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant ("Browns Ferry") are boiling water reactor units, and the units at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant ("Sequoyah") and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant ("Watts Bar") are pressurized water reactor units.  Operating information for each of these units is included in the table below.

Watts Bar Unit 1 | 1,157 | 85.3 | 2035 
Watts Bar Unit 2 | 1,121 | 64.1 | 2055 

Other Nuclear Initiatives. TVA has an Early Site Permit to potentially construct and operate SMRs at TVA's Clinch River Nuclear Site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and in 2022, the TVA Board approved a programmatic approach to exploring advanced nuclear technology (the "New Nuclear Program"). See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Small Modular Reactors.
Other Nuclear Matters. Operating nuclear facilities subjects TVA to waste disposal, decommissioning, and insurance requirements, as well as litigation risks. See Fuel Supply — Nuclear Fuel below for a discussion of spent nuclear fuel and low-level radioactive waste, Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies for a discussion of TVA's nuclear decommissioning liabilities and the related trust and nuclear insurance, and Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings for a discussion of legal proceedings related to TVA's nuclear program, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference.
Natural Gas and/or Oil-Fired
    At September 30, 2022, TVA's natural gas and oil-fired fleet consisted of 101 combustion turbine power blocks (81 simple-cycle units, one cogeneration unit, and 14 combined-cycle power units, accounting for 11,777 MW of summer net capability, and five idled units at Allen Combustion Turbine Facility: Units 2, 3, 11, 17, and 18). Sixty-six of the simple-cycle units are currently capable of quick-start response allowing full generation capability in approximately 10 minutes. The economic dispatch of natural gas-fired plants depends on both the day-to-day price of natural gas and the price of other available intermediate resources such as coal-fired plants. TVA uses simple-cycle units to meet peaking or backup power needs. TVA's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP") projects significant solar expansion over the next decade. The natural gas-fired fleet supports that expansion by providing reliability across all hours, as well as the flexibility to help manage ramping and intermittency. In addition, as TVA evaluates its coal-fired fleet, it will also evaluate adding flexible lower carbon-emitting gas plants as a strategy to maintain reliability.
    See Item 2, Properties — Generating Properties, Note 8 — Leases, Note 11 — Variable Interest Entities, and Note 14 — Debt and Other Obligations for a discussion of lease arrangements into which TVA has entered in connection with certain combustion turbine units ("CTs"). Because of TVA's strategy of portfolio diversification and reduction of air emissions, TVA may decide to make further strategic investments in natural gas-fired facilities in the future by purchase, construction, or lease. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Natural Gas-Fired Units for a discussion of ongoing projects at certain natural gas-fired facilities.
Coal-Fired
     At September 30, 2022, TVA had five coal-fired plants consisting of 25 active units, accounting for 6,580 MW of summer net capability. TVA considers units to be in an active state when the unit is generating, available for service, or temporarily unavailable due to equipment failures, inspections, or repairs. All other coal-fired units are considered retired. In 2019, the TVA Board approved the retirement of Bull Run Fossil Plant ("Bull Run") by December 2023.
    Coal-fired plants have been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory requirements over the last few decades, including those under the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA").  TVA has committed to a programmatic approach for the evaluation of its sites where coal combustion residuals ("CCR") are stored to meet all applicable state and federal regulations.  See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and 

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Coal Combustion Residuals — Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities.
    TVA is moving toward a more balanced generation plan with greater reliance on lower-cost and cleaner energy generation technologies. Since September 30, 2010, TVA has reduced its summer net capability of coal-fired units by 7,653 MW. Following the publication of the 2019 IRP, TVA conducted end-of-life evaluations of the remaining coal fleet to inform long-term planning. These evaluations confirmed that the aging coal fleet is among the oldest in the nation and is experiencing deterioration of material condition and performance challenges. The performance challenges are projected to increase due to the coal fleet’s advancing age and the difficulty of adapting the coal fleet’s generation within the changing generation profile. TVA is evaluating the impact of retiring the balance of the coal-fired fleet by 2035, and that evaluation includes environmental review, public input, and TVA Board approval. Environmental reviews evaluating the potential retirement of the Cumberland Fossil Plant ("Cumberland") and Kingston Fossil Plant ("Kingston") and replacement with other generation are now underway, in addition to the public input process. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio.
Diesel Generators
    At September 30, 2022, TVA had one diesel generator plant consisting of five units, and this facility accounted for 9
MW of summer net capability. These units are not currently dispatched for generation to the transmission grid.
Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant
At September 30, 2022, TVA had four units at Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant ("Raccoon Mountain") with a total net summer capability of 1,654 MW. These units are utilized to balance the transmission system as well as generate power. TVA uses electricity generated by its fleet during periods of low demand to operate pumps that fill the reservoir at Raccoon Mountain. Then, during periods of high or peak demand, the water is released and the pumps reverse to work as power generating turbines. New hydroelectric pumped storage is one of several technologies that TVA is exploring as part of its decarbonization efforts to ensure the reliability and resiliency of the grid.
Renewable Energy Resources
As more consumers and businesses are seeking cleaner energy, the utility industry is evolving to meet those needs. As TVA also evolves, it will see impacts to the way it does business through the pricing of products, transmission of energy, and development of new products and services for its customers in support of changing customer preferences. Many companies are focusing on sustainability and requiring more energy efficiency and renewable energy options. In addition, TVA also seeks to obtain greater amounts of its power supply from clean resources to work towards carbon emission reductions. As a result, TVA is increasing its renewable energy portfolio, by investing in existing hydroelectric assets through the Hydro Life Extension Program and securing renewable power purchase agreements. New utility-scale solar is increasing, in part driven by customers’ demand through TVA’s Green Invest Program. TVA also encourages renewable power and offers renewable resources through various current programs and offerings. See below for information on renewable energy resources and Power Purchase and Other Agreements for information on TVA’s power purchase agreements, including renewable agreements.
Conventional Hydroelectric Dams. At September 30, 2022, TVA's hydroelectric fleet consisted of 29 conventional hydroelectric dams throughout the Tennessee River system with 106 active generating units that accounted for 3,754 MW of summer net capability and three units at Wilbur Hydroelectric Facility: Units 1-3, that were in long-term outage and unavailable for service at September 30, 2022.  The amount of electricity that TVA is able to generate from its hydroelectric plants depends on a number of factors, including the amount of precipitation and runoff, initial water levels, generating unit availability, and the need for water for competing water management objectives.  When these factors are unfavorable, TVA must increase its reliance on higher cost generation plants and purchased power.  In addition, a portion of energy generated by nine U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("USACE") dams on the Cumberland River system contributes to the TVA power system, and electric generation from the USACE dams is dependent on the same factors that affect generation from the TVA-owned dams.  See Weather and Seasonality below and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Dam Safety Assurance Initiatives.
Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 has a unique reversible turbine/generator that acts as a pump and a turbine enhancing TVA's ability to balance baseload generation.  At September 30, 2022, Hiwassee Hydro Unit 2 accounted for 86 MW of the conventional hydroelectric summer net capability. 
    Hydro Life Extension Program.  TVA's Hydro Life Extension Program began in 2021 with a focus on recovering and preserving TVA's extensive hydroelectric fleet, improving efficiency and flexibility, and ensuring long-term reliability of this vital clean energy asset. Hydroelectric generation will continue to be an important part of TVA's energy mix in the future. It plays a vital role in carbon reduction initiatives, the ability to integrate other renewables into the power portfolio, and TVA's ability to meet changing customer preferences for cleaner energy sources.

    Dam Safety Assurance Program. TVA has an established dam safety program, which includes procedures based on the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety, with the objective of reducing the risk of a dam safety event. The program analyzes, evaluates, and manages risks through a systematic and thorough process that facilitates decision-making for the safety of a structure, identifying necessary actions to reduce risk, including remediation projects, and prioritization of actions for TVA's river dams. Prioritization is driven by reducing risk to the public and asset preservation. TVA also continues to provide routine care of the dams as part of the dam safety program through inspections, monitoring, and maintenance, among other activities.
Self-Directed Solar. During 2019, the TVA Board approved the opportunity for TVA to explore being directly involved in the development of a utility-scale solar project, contingent on the successful completion of environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") and other applicable laws. Mounting solar supply chain constraints are being seen in TVA’s Self-Directed Solar project, which have resulted in a delay in the estimated completion date. Project cost increases are also anticipated due to cost escalations from the state of global supply chains. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Self-Directed Solar.

Other Renewable Energy Resources. In addition to the hydroelectric units above, TVA owns 13 solar installations that account for approximately one MW of summer net capability. Other renewable energy resources also include renewable energy purchases, a majority associated with TVA renewable programs. See Power Purchase and Other Agreements for information on renewable PPAs. TVA's current renewable programs and offerings include:
Small-scale Solutions. The Green Connect Program connects residential customers who are interested in on-site solar photovoltaic ("PV") and/or battery storage systems with qualified solar and battery storage installers who agree to install to Green
Connect Program Standards. These qualified installers, who are members of TVA's Quality Contractor Network, are insured and
licensed and have also completed special training on TVA guidelines. Participants have access to objective information and
assurance that their solar PV system has met Green Connect Program Standards through installation verifications.
Utility-scale Solutions. The Green Invest Program matches customer demand with renewable supply through a Green Invest Agreement. The goal of the Green Invest Program is to meet the long-term sustainability needs of customers at scale. TVA procures the needed renewable supply through a diversified approach, which could include a competitive procurement process, strategic partnerships, or construction of renewable facilities to meet these needs. As of September 30, 2022, more than 2,000 MW of renewable PPAs have been matched to customers through the Green Invest Program. In addition, Generation Flexibility is a solution available to long-term LPC partners and supports the deployment of up to 2,000 MW of distributed solar to provide clean, local generation. See Note 17 — Revenue.
Other Renewable Solutions. The Green Switch Program allows customers to support solar renewable resources through purchasing renewable solar energy generated in the Tennessee Valley. The product is sold in blocks of 200 kWh or matches 100% of a customer's electricity usage (available through select LPCs). During the year ended September 30, 2022, participants purchased 82,097 MWh through the Green Switch Program. The Green Flex Program gives commercial and industrial customers the ability to meet sustainability goals and to make renewable energy claims through RECs from wind generation located outside TVA's service area. During the year ended September 30, 2022, participants purchased approximately one million RECs through the Green Flex Program.
TVA tracks its renewable energy commitments and claims through the management of RECs. The RECs, which each represent 1 megawatt-hour ("MWh") of renewable energy generation, are principally associated with wind, solar, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric. TVA continues to evaluate ways to adjust to customer preferences and requirements for cleaner and greener energy, including the acquisition of RECs from renewable purchased power that can be sold to customers to meet their needs. Overall, TVA will procure needed renewable supply through a diversified approach, which could include a competitive procurement process, strategic partnerships, or construction of renewable facilities to meet these needs.

Total Renewable Energy Resources. As of September 30, 2022, TVA's total renewable energy resources amounted to 8,264 MW. Of this amount, 6,236 MW are operating while 2,028 MW are contracted but not yet online, including the 200 MW from TVA's self-directed solar project. As of September 30, 2021, TVA's total renewable energy resources amounted to 8,269 MW, with 6,086 MW operating and 2,183 MW contracted but not yet online, which included TVA's self-directed solar project.
Notes
(1) Contracted resources are executed power purchase agreements expected to come online at a future date.

Energy Equity Programs
An equitable energy system is one where the economic, health, and social benefits of participation extend to all levels of society. TVA plans to address energy equity disparities through inclusive energy programming focused on expanding partnerships, improving program access, and catalyzing investment in communities where all individuals can benefit from TVA's resources. TVA's Low Income Energy Efficiency Programs include:

Home Uplift Program. Through the Home Uplift Program, TVA is partnering with LPCs, state and local governments, non-profit agencies, energy efficiency advocates, third-party contributors, and the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association ("TVPPA") to complete home evaluations and make high-impact home energy upgrades for qualifying homeowners. In addition, TVA and LPCs conduct workshops to educate homeowners about low and no-cost energy efficiency upgrades that improve their quality of life. 
School Uplift Program. Through the School Uplift Program pilot, TVA is partnering with LPCs as well as state and local governments to assist schools with adopting strategic energy management practices. The engagement with each school includes monthly virtual workshops and fosters performance through competitions for energy efficiency grants and grants for learning environment improvements. 
Community Centered Growth Program. Through the Community Centered Growth Program, TVA is partnering with LPCs to assist small businesses located within underserved communities with energy evaluations and energy improvement investments provided by TVA at no cost to the small business.
Distributed Energy Resources
    Consumer desire for energy choice, among other things, is driving the expectation for flexible options in the electric industry. TVA and LPCs are working together to leverage the strengths of the Tennessee Valley public power model to provide distributed energy solutions that are economical, sustainable, and flexible. TVA will focus on the safety and reliability impacts of these resources as they are interconnected to the grid and will aim to ensure that the pricing of electricity remains as low as feasible. Additional regulatory considerations and analysis may be required as the distributed energy resources ("DER") market, technologies, and programs evolve. 
    In 2017, the TVA Board authorized up to $300 million to be spent over the next 10 years, subject to annual budget availability and necessary environmental reviews, to build an enhanced fiber optic network that will better connect TVA's operational assets. Fiber is a vital part of TVA's modern communication infrastructure and is needed to help manage DER as they enter the market. The new fiber optic lines will also improve the reliability and resiliency of the generation and transmission system.
    New energy management systems and energy storage technologies present opportunities for more sophisticated and integrated operation of the entire grid. The advent of electric vehicles and small-scale renewable generation has hastened the development of energy storage technologies that have the potential to mitigate the intermittent supply issues associated with many renewable generation options. Implementation of these technologies in conjunction with two-way communication to the site creates the potential for more efficient usage of other DER on the grid.
    TVA is partnering with LPCs and others to support the electrification of transportation in the Tennessee Valley in a multi-year EV initiative. The initiative focuses on reducing or eliminating EV market barriers by setting EV policies, improving charging infrastructure availability, expanding EV availability and offerings, and spreading EV consumer awareness. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Electric Vehicles.
    Onsite energy management technologies and the proliferation of companies interested in providing services to support and aggregate the impacts of such systems provide another DER opportunity. Such systems can afford the consumer benefits through reduced consumption, increased comfort, detailed energy use data, and savings from time-sensitive rate structures. TVA and LPCs must consider the integration of the impacts from changes in energy usage patterns resulting from the operation of such systems.
    Demand response systems that take advantage of the increasing sophistication in communication to homes, businesses, and distribution system assets also afford the opportunity for more granular control of system demand. Technologies can manage individual customer systems to shift usage from peak to off-peak periods and create significant reductions in the need for peak generation output or curtail usage for short periods to balance system demand. More sophisticated distribution control systems can also lower peak demand through control of excess voltage on the grid on either a dispatchable or continuous basis. Some large industrial customers also have the capacity to respond instantaneously and can augment operational flexibility by providing ancillary services.
    TVA is leading an initiative to determine the value of DER for its system. Initial efforts are focused on small-scale distributed (rooftop) solar, but the efforts are general enough to allow for other distributed options. These efforts are ongoing, led by a team that includes technical support from the Electric Power Research Institute ("EPRI"), to develop a methodology to identify site preferences on the distribution systems of the LPCs. This work, along with locational analysis already completed by TVA, will help in placing utility-scale solar in furtherance of the IRP recommendations as well as distributed solar to meet the needs of LPCs. See Research and Development below.
Power Purchase and Other Agreements
TVA acquires power from a variety of power producers generally through long-term and short-term PPAs as well as through spot market purchases.  During 2022, TVA acquired approximately 94 percent of the power that it purchased through the long-term PPAs described below, including agreements for long-term renewable generation resources, approximately three percent through short-term PPAs, and approximately three percent on the spot market. During 2021, TVA acquired approximately 94 percent of the power that it purchased through long-term PPAs, approximately one percent through short-term PPAs, and approximately five percent on the spot market.
TVA's capability provided by PPAs is primarily provided under contracts that expire between 2022 and 2045 and are described in the table below.

Under federal law, TVA is required to purchase energy from qualifying facilities (cogenerators and small power producers) at TVA's avoided cost of either generating this energy itself or purchasing this energy from another source. TVA fulfills this requirement through the Dispersed Power Production Program. At September 30, 2022, there were 642 generation sources, with a combined qualifying capacity of 278 MW, whose power TVA purchases under this program.
Fuel Supply
General
TVA's consumption of various types of fuel depends largely on the demand for electricity by TVA's customers, the availability of various generating units, and the availability and cost of fuel. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Financial Results — Operating Expenses.
Nuclear Fuel
Current Fuel Supply. Converting uranium to nuclear fuel generally involves four stages: the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas; the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride into fuel assemblies. TVA plans to continue using contracts of various products, lengths, and terms as well as inventory to meet the projected nuclear fuel needs of its nuclear fleet.  The net book value of TVA's nuclear fuel was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 15 — Risk Management Activities and Derivative Transactions — Counterparty Risk.
TVA, the DOE, and certain nuclear fuel contractors have entered into agreements, referred to as the Down-blend Offering for Tritium ("DBOT"), that provide for the production, processing, and storage of low-enriched uranium that is to be made using surplus DOE highly enriched uranium and other uranium.  Low-enriched uranium can be fabricated into fuel for use in a nuclear power plant.  Production of the low-enriched uranium began in 2019 and is contracted to continue through September 2025.  Contract activity after that date will consist of storage and flag management.  Flag management ensures that the uranium is free from foreign obligations, and unencumbered by policy restrictions, so that it can be used in connection with the production of tritium. Under the terms of the interagency agreement between the DOE and TVA, the DOE will reimburse TVA for a portion of the costs of converting the highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Down-blend Offering for Tritium for a more detailed discussion of the DBOT project.
Low-Level Radioactive Waste.  Certain materials and supplies used in the normal operation of nuclear electrical generating units are potentially exposed to low levels of radiation. TVA sends shipments of low-level radioactive waste to burial facilities in Clive, Utah and Andrews, Texas.  TVA is capable of storing some low-level radioactive waste at its own facilities for an extended period of time, if necessary.
Spent Nuclear Fuel.  All three nuclear sites have dry cask storage facilities.  Sequoyah will need additional capacity by 2029.  Watts Bar will need additional capacity by 2039.  Browns Ferry will need additional capacity by 2037. To recover the cost of providing long-term, onsite storage for spent nuclear fuel, TVA filed a breach of contract suit against the U.S. in the Court of Federal Claims in 2001. As a result of this lawsuit and related agreements, TVA has collected approximately $414 million through 2022. 
Tritium-Related Services.  TVA and the DOE are engaged in a long-term interagency agreement under which TVA will, at the DOE's request, irradiate tritium-producing burnable absorber rods ("TPBARs") to assist the DOE in producing tritium for the Department of Defense ("DOD").  This agreement, which ends in 2035, requires the DOE to reimburse TVA for the costs that TVA incurs in connection with providing irradiation services and to pay TVA an irradiation services fee at a specified rate per TPBAR over the period when irradiation occurs.
 In general, TPBARs are irradiated for one operating cycle, which lasts about 18 months.  At the end of the cycle, TVA removes the irradiated rods and loads them into a shipping cask.  The DOE then ships them to its tritium-extraction facility.  TVA loads a fresh set of TPBARs into the reactor during each refueling outage.  Irradiating the TPBARs does not affect TVA's ability to safely operate the reactors to produce electricity.
TVA has provided irradiation services using Watts Bar Unit 1 since 2003. Although the interagency agreement provides for irradiation services to be performed at Watts Bar and Sequoyah, TVA expects the Watts Bar site to provide sufficient capacity 

to fulfill this agreement in the near term. The DOE notified TVA of future increased needs for tritium requiring the use of a second reactor. In 2019, TVA received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") for a license amendment to authorize the irradiation of TPBARs in Watts Bar Unit 2. TVA began tritium production in Watts Bar Unit 2 in 2021. The DOE's decision also allows for irradiation of TPBARs at Sequoyah in the future; however, TVA does not have plans to employ Sequoyah units for tritium production in the near term. TVA does intend to increase its production within currently licensed limits beginning in November 2024 for Watts Bar Unit 1 and April 2025 for Watts Bar Unit 2, to align with a DOE request for increased tritium. TVA is currently working to submit a license amendment request with the NRC to fulfill this request.
Natural Gas and Fuel Oil
During 2022, TVA purchased a significant amount of its natural gas requirements from a variety of suppliers under contracts with terms of up to 2 years and purchased substantially all of its fuel oil requirements on the spot market. The net book value of TVA's natural gas inventory was $54 million and $22 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Natural gas inventory increased primarily due to higher gas prices, as well as an increase in the amount of stored gas to mitigate fuel price volatility. The net book value of TVA's fuel oil inventory was $84 million and $69 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At September 30, 2022, 80 of the combustion turbine assets were dual-fuel capable, and TVA has fuel oil stored on each of these sites as a backup to natural gas.
TVA purchases natural gas from multiple suppliers on a daily, monthly, seasonal, and term basis.  During 2022, daily, monthly, seasonal, and term contracts accounted for 27 percent, 4 percent, 29 percent, and 40 percent of purchases, respectively.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths and terms to meet the projected natural gas needs of its natural gas fleet.  During 2022, TVA arranged for the transportation of natural gas on eight separate pipelines, with approximately 68 percent being transported on two pipelines. During 2022, TVA maintained a total of approximately 1,501,000 million British thermal unit(s) ("mmBtu") per day of firm transportation capacity on eight major pipelines, with approximately 66 percent of total firm transportation capacity being maintained on two pipelines.
TVA utilizes natural gas storage services at seven facilities with a total capacity of 7.25 billion per cubic feet ("Bcf") of firm service and 5.00 Bcf of interruptible service to manage the daily balancing requirements of the eight pipelines used by TVA, with approximately 59 percent of the total storage capacity being maintained at two facilities. During 2022, storage levels were generally maintained at between 40 and 80 percent of the maximum contracted capacity at each facility. As TVA's natural gas requirements grow, it is anticipated that additional storage capacity may need to be acquired to meet the needs of the generating assets.  In 2023, TVA expects to increase its storage portfolio by approximately 10 percent. 
Coal
Coal consumption at TVA's coal-fired generating facilities during both 2022 and 2021 was approximately 12 million tons.  At September 30, 2022 and 2021, TVA had 25 days and 21 days of system-wide coal supply at full burn rate, respectively, with net book values of $165 million and $107 million, respectively. 
TVA utilizes both short-term and long-term coal contracts.  During 2022, long-term contracts made up 92 percent of coal purchases, and short-term contracts accounted for the remaining 8 percent.  TVA plans to continue using contracts of various lengths, terms, and coal quality to meet its expected consumption and inventory requirements.  During 2022 and 2021, TVA purchased coal by basin as follows:

    The following charts present the proportion of each delivery method TVA utilizes for its coal supply for the periods indicated:
Coal inventory increased at September 30, 2022 as compared to September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher costs of fuel, including transportation costs, coal conservation efforts, and an increase in inventory levels in preparation for winter inventory needs. The increased inventory levels will help mitigate expected constraints on fuel supply and continued natural gas price volatility which may cause coal to be a more favorable economic fuel choice during that period. However, total system coal inventories were lower than planned throughout 2022 primarily due to higher than forecasted coal generation and continued constraints on fuel supply. Higher coal generation was driven by an increase in sales of electricity, primarily due to economic growth in the Tennessee Valley region and weather patterns, and an increase in natural gas prices making coal a more favorable economic fuel choice. Fuel supply constraints were due to limited mine production, labor shortages, an increase in coal exports, and a reallocation of transportation capacity to support export sales and other commodities. TVA will continue to monitor these constraints and coal inventory levels, as TVA anticipates that these challenges will continue into 2023. See also Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Operational Challenges — Coal Supply.
Transmission
The TVA transmission system is one of the largest high-voltage transmission systems in North America.  TVA's transmission system has 69 interconnections with 13 neighboring electric systems and delivered approximately 163 billion kWh of electricity to TVA customers in 2022.  In carrying out its responsibility for transmission grid reliability in the TVA service area, TVA has operated with 99.999 percent reliability since 2000 in delivering electricity to customers. See Item 2, Properties — Transmission Properties.
Pursuant to its Transmission Service Guidelines, TVA offers transmission services to eligible customers to transmit wholesale power in a manner that is comparable to TVA's own use of the transmission system. TVA has also adopted and operates in accordance with its published Transmission Standards of Conduct and separates its transmission function from its power marketing function. As a Balancing Authority, Distribution Provider, Generator Owner, Generator Operator, Planning Coordinator, Reliability Coordinator, Resource Planner, Transmission Owner, Transmission Operator, Transmission Planner, and Transmission Service Provider, as those terms are defined for purposes of North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") regulations, TVA is also subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by the NERC and approved by FERC. See Regulation.
 Additional transmission upgrades may be required to maintain reliability. Upgrades may include enhancements to existing lines and substations or new installations as necessary to provide adequate power transmission capacity, maintain voltage support, and ensure generating plant and transmission system stability. In addition to upgrades to maintain reliability, TVA’s Grid of Tomorrow initiative aims to increase grid flexibility to enable greater use of renewable resources such as solar, wind, and other forms of distributed generation and includes making data and communications upgrades as demonstrated by investments in the new system operations center, energy management system, and fiber optic network. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio.
In addition, TVA is working on various projects with universities, EPRI, and others to help enable a dynamic and multi-directional grid. TVA is also working in partnership with LPCs to modernize their distribution systems by developing a shared vision and roadmap for transforming the Tennessee Valley’s transmission and distribution systems into an integrated regional grid.

These initiatives support TVA’s decarbonization efforts while helping ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission to deliver reliable power at the lowest feasible rate. Investments in a modernized grid will help enable enhanced monitoring and control of TVA’s transmission and generation portfolio.
Weather and Seasonality
Weather affects both the demand for and the market prices of electricity. TVA's power system is generally a dual-peaking system in which the demand for electricity peaks during the summer and winter months to meet cooling and heating needs. TVA uses degree days to measure the impact of weather on its power operations. Degree days measure the extent to which the TVA system 23-station average temperatures vary from 65 degrees Fahrenheit. See Item 1, Business — Flood Control Activities, Item 1, Business — Environmental Matters — Climate Change — Physical Impacts of Climate Change, and 
Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Sales of Electricity.
Competition
    TVA provides electricity in a service area that is largely free of competition from other electric power providers. This service area is defined primarily by provisions of law and long-term contracts. The region in which TVA or LPCs that distribute TVA power may provide power is limited and is often referred to as "the fence." Under the FPA, the Anti-Cherrypicking Amendment ("ACPA") limits the ability of others to use the TVA transmission system for the purpose of serving customers within TVA's service area.  State service territory laws limit unregulated third parties' ability to sell electricity to consumers. All TVA wholesale power contracts are all requirements contracts; however, Power Supply Flexibility Agreements available to LPCs that have executed long-term contracts with TVA allow LPCs to locally generate or purchase up to approximately five percent of their average total hourly energy sales over a certain time period in order to meet their individual customers' needs. In addition, other utilities may use their own transmission lines to serve customers within TVA's service area, and third parties are able to avoid the restrictions on serving end-use customers by selling or leasing generating assets to a customer rather than selling electricity. These threats underscore the need for TVA to design rates and strategically price its products and services to be competitive. There have also been some efforts to erode the ACPA, and the protection of the provision could be limited and perhaps eliminated by federal legislation at some time in the future. See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Challenge to Anti-Cherrypicking Amendment for updates to a legal proceeding challenging the ACPA.
    TVA also faces competition in the form of emerging technologies.  Improvements in energy efficiency technologies, smart technologies, and energy storage technologies may reduce the demand for centrally provided power. The growing interest by customers in generating their own power through DER has the potential to lead to a reduction in the load served by TVA as well as cause TVA to re-evaluate how it operates the overall grid system to continue to provide highly reliable power at affordable rates.  See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Fiber Optic Network.
    Finally, TVA and other utility companies are facing an evolving marketplace of increased competition driven by customer choice and behavior. As technology develops, consumers' demands for access to diverse products and services may increase, and customers could choose another utility to meet some or all of their power needs where available, pursue self-generation to meet some or all of their power needs, or move their operations outside of TVA's service territory.
Research and Development
    Investments in TVA's research portfolio are supported through partnership and collaboration with LPCs, EPRI, the DOE, federal agencies, peer utilities, universities, and industry vendors and through participation in professional societies and other research consortiums.
    Annual investments made in science and technological innovation help meet future business and operational
challenges. Each year, TVA's annual research portfolio is updated based on a broad range of operational and industry drivers to assess key technology gaps, performance issues, or other significant issues, addressed through research and development. Core research activities directly support optimization of TVA's generation and transmission assets, air and water quality, energy utilization, and distributed/clean energy integration. TVA also provides research and development services on behalf of LPCs by helping optimize their distribution systems and helping minimize technology gaps in energy utilization and consumer technologies.
Beginning in 2020, TVA placed a high priority on providing research which aligns to and supports its six transformative initiatives: decarbonization, energy storage, electric vehicles, advanced nuclear, connected communities, and regional grid transformation. TVA has placed a special emphasis on research leading to the understanding and application of clean resources to support the reduction of carbon emissions from its power supply. This research supports both TVA and national strategic interests to reduce carbon emissions and will serve to both catalyze and support TVA’s decarbonization initiative.

TVA is in the second year of a coalition of utilities and researchers, led by EPRI and Gas Technology Institute, whose purpose is to engage, inform, and support global low-carbon resources initiatives to develop the pathways for the advancement 

of carbon reducing technologies for large scale utility deployment. This is a five-year program and includes research to support creating resource options, such as alternative fuels (hydrogen, ammonia, and methanized derivatives), carbon capture, electrification, and utilization of clean DER as part of the overall low-carbon resource mix. TVA has made progress understanding regional geology and carbon capture technologies and is evaluating both with an emphasis on the potential for carbon capture in TVA's future. TVA is also exploring the potential for hydrogen to serve as a tool in the decarbonization of the Tennessee Valley, both within the electrical sector and elsewhere. TVA and other major utility companies are working together to respond to the recently announced funding opportunity from the DOE with the intention of obtaining federal financial support for a Southeast Hydrogen Hub.
At the forefront of the energy storage initiative is deploying grid-scale battery energy storage technology to optimize the existing TVA generation assets and improve the resiliency of the transmission system. In 2020, TVA launched its first TVA-owned, grid scale, lithium-ion demonstration battery project and in 2022, TVA broke ground for the battery project, which will be located near Vonore, Tennessee. The system integration learnings from this project will guide future application of battery storage as part of the evolving bulk power system in the region. 
    TVA continues to develop potential electrification programs, in addition to the Fast Charge Network, that improve resource use and reduce environmental impacts (especially in the transportation sector). TVA programs are based on previous assessments, which included a multi-stakeholder vision and roadmap effort aimed at identifying the path forward for electric vehicles in Tennessee. The approach provides for broad engagement from industry, government, and utilities that could be applied in other states in the TVA service territory. In addition, TVA is continuing its evaluation of potential electric vehicle adoption strategies through coordination of activities with EPRI and state and industry stakeholders related to operational fleet requirements. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Electric Vehicles.
TVA is committed to investing in the future of nuclear and continues to evaluate the licensing and design of emerging nuclear technologies, such as advanced light water SMRs and advanced non-light water reactors, as part of technology innovation efforts aimed at developing the energy system of the future. In December 2019, TVA became the first utility in the nation to successfully obtain approval for an early site permit from the NRC to potentially construct and operate SMRs at its Clinch River Site. Additionally, TVA is partnering with technology progressive organizations to evaluate the economic feasibility of advanced nuclear reactors. TVA has entered into memorandums of understanding and agreements that allow for mutual collaboration to explore advanced reactor designs as a next-generation nuclear technology while leveraging the expertise of federally funded research and development centers, utilities, vendors, and academic institutions. These partnerships are important steps in the early stages of evaluation as TVA considers the prospect of new nuclear. These partnerships are also leveraged to develop innovations to improve advanced nuclear designs, streamline licensing pathways, find efficiencies in construction methods, and optimize operating expenses. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Optimum Energy Portfolio — Small Modular Reactors for additional discussion and total costs related to SMR work.
TVA established 13 connected communities pilot projects with stakeholders and has been engaging in advanced buildings research to support the initiative. Connected communities projects are aimed at addressing today’s challenges with community-driven information and technology solutions to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee Valley. Research will continue to identify best practices, better understand challenges in the Tennessee Valley, and scale up the learnings from the pilots to broader application throughout the Tennessee Valley.

Finally, TVA and LPCs are engaged in several initiatives related to grid modernization. Research includes technologies and applications advancement in intelligent transmission and distribution systems. Smart meter technology has the potential to shift usage patterns away from peak demand times which could change costs significantly. Additionally, intelligent transmission systems would give TVA the ability to nearly instantaneously diagnose problems, make corrections, and engage transmission and generation resources quickly so that power would keep flowing. This could promote reduced emissions, lower energy costs, and add greater flexibility to accommodate the new consumer-generated sources under TVA's renewable energy programs. TVA also worked with LPC partners to execute a survey of LPC technology capabilities and plans, and the results are helping shape a realistic path toward TVA's long-term goals. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Distributed Energy Resources and Transmission. 
Flood Control Activities
    The Tennessee River watershed has one of the highest annual rainfall totals of any watershed in the U.S., averaging 51 inches per year. During 2022, approximately 55 inches of rain fell in the Tennessee Valley. TVA manages the Tennessee River system in an integrated manner, which includes managing minimum river flows and minimum depths for navigation, reducing flood damage, generating low-cost hydroelectric power, maintaining flows that support habitat for fish and other aquatic species, maintaining water supply, and providing recreational opportunities for the Tennessee Valley. In addition, having cool water available helps TVA to meet thermal compliance and support normal operation of TVA's nuclear and fossil-fueled plants, while oxygenating water helps fish species remain healthy. TVA spills or releases excess water through its dams in order to reduce flood damage to the Tennessee Valley. TVA typically spills only when all available hydroelectric generating turbines are operating at full capacity and additional water still needs to be moved downstream.

    The Tennessee Valley experienced above normal rainfall during 2022 with rainfall and runoff at 108 percent and 106 percent of normal, respectively. The above normal rainfall and runoff during the period supported TVA's objective to generate low-cost hydroelectric power while also meeting its river system commitments, including flood mitigation, which is estimated to have prevented damages across the Tennessee Valley of approximately $3 million in 2022 and $9.7 billion over TVA's recorded history.
Environmental Stewardship Activities
    TVA's mission includes managing the Tennessee River, its tributaries, and federal lands along the shoreline to provide, among other things, year-round navigation, flood damage reduction, affordable and reliable electricity, recreational opportunities, adequate water supply, improved water quality, and natural resource protection.  There are 49 dams that comprise TVA's integrated reservoir system. Each dam may also have ancillary structures used to support or assist the main dam's function. The reservoir system provides approximately 800 miles of commercially navigable waterways and also provides significant flood reduction benefits both within the Tennessee River system and downstream on the lower Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The reservoir system also provides a water supply for residential and industrial customers, as well as cooling water for TVA's coal-fired plants, combined cycle plants, and nuclear power plants. TVA's Environmental Policy provides objectives for an integrated approach related to providing reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy; engaging in proactive stewardship of the Tennessee River system and public lands; and supporting sustainable economic growth. The Environmental Policy also provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas related to reducing environmental impacts on the Tennessee Valley's natural resources, including reducing carbon intensity and air emissions; minimizing waste; and protecting water resources and cultural resources. TVA's Biodiversity Policy further builds on the TVA record of environmental stewardship by acknowledging the critical role of natural systems in achieving its mission of improving the quality of life in the region. The policy commits to seeking conservation opportunities within capital projects and improving current operational practices to help minimize impacts, reduce costs, and enhance biodiversity.
    TVA serves the people of the TVA region through the integrated management of the Tennessee River system and public lands, which include approximately 11,000 miles of shoreline; 650,000 surface acres of reservoir water; and 293,000 acres of reservoir lands.  TVA accomplishes this mission and supports the objectives of the TVA Environmental Policy through implementation of its natural resources stewardship strategy.  Within this strategy, TVA confirms a desire to remain agile, balance competing demands, and be a catalyst for collaboration in order to protect and enhance biological, cultural, and water resources as well as create and sustain destinations for recreation and opportunities for learning and research.  As part of the strategy, TVA intends to assist water-based community development with the issuance of permits, technical support, and land agreements using planning, clear regulations, meaningful guidelines, and consistent enforcement. Additional guidance for carrying out many of TVA's essential stewardship responsibilities is provided in TVA's Natural Resource Plan. The plan aligns TVA's mission through economic development, energy, and environmental stewardship and guides business planning. It includes ten focus areas, providing a comprehensive view of resource stewardship efforts.
Economic Development Activities
    Economic development, along with energy production and environmental stewardship, is one of the primary statutory purposes of TVA. Economic development programs developed by TVA support all communities, including rural and economically distressed communities, across the Tennessee Valley. Through its economic development activities, TVA endeavors to recruit and retain companies in targeted business sectors, foster capital investment and job growth, and assist communities in the Tennessee Valley with economic growth opportunities. 
TVA seeks to achieve these goals through a combination of initiatives and partnerships with LPCs, regional, state, and local agencies, and communities by providing financial incentives, technical services, industry expertise, and site-selection assistance to new and existing businesses in the Tennessee Valley. TVA's economic development incentive programs offer competitive incentives to new and existing power customers in certain business sectors that make multi-year commitments to invest in the Tennessee Valley. See Note 17 — Revenue — Contract Balances — Economic Development Incentives for total incentives recorded. In addition to providing financial support to businesses, TVA offers communities and economic developers site selection services, technical and project development assistance, and leadership training services.
    In 2022, TVA's economic development efforts, reliability, and competitive rates helped attract or expand 245 companies into the TVA service area. These companies announced projected capital investments of over $10.2 billion and are expected to create or retain approximately 66,500 jobs.
Regulation
TVA is required to comply with comprehensive and complex laws, regulations, and orders.  The costs of complying with these laws, regulations, and orders are expected to be substantial, and costs could be significantly more than TVA anticipates.
Congress
    TVA exists pursuant to the TVA Act as enacted by Congress and carries on its operations in accordance with this legislation.  Congress can enact legislation expanding or reducing TVA's activities, change TVA's structure, and even eliminate TVA.  Congress can also enact legislation requiring the sale of some or all of the assets TVA operates or reduce the U.S.'s ownership in TVA.  To allow TVA to operate more flexibly than a traditional government agency, Congress exempted TVA from all or parts of certain general federal laws that govern other agencies, such as federal labor relations laws and the laws related to the hiring of federal employees, the procurement of supplies and services, and the acquisition of land.  Other federal laws enacted since the creation of TVA that are applicable to other agencies have been made applicable to TVA, including those related to paying employees overtime and protecting the environment, cultural resources, and civil rights.
Securities and Exchange Commission
    Section 37 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires TVA to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") such periodic, current, and supplementary information, documents, and reports as would be required pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act if TVA were an issuer of a security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act.  Section 37 of the Exchange Act exempts TVA from complying with Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act, which requires each member of a listed issuer's audit committee to be an independent member of the board of directors of the issuer.  Since TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the U.S., securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may be offered and sold without registration under the Securities Act.  In addition, securities issued or guaranteed by TVA are "exempted securities" and "government securities" under the Exchange Act.  TVA is also exempt from Sections 14(a)-(d) and 14(f)-(h) of the Exchange Act (which address proxy solicitations) insofar as those sections relate to securities issued by TVA, and transactions in TVA securities are exempt from rules governing tender offers under Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act.  Also, since TVA securities are exempted securities under the Securities Act, TVA is exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 insofar as it relates to securities issued by TVA, and no independent trustee is required for these securities.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
    Under the FPA, TVA is not a "public utility," a term which primarily refers to investor-owned utilities.  Therefore, TVA is not subject to the full jurisdiction that FERC exercises over public utilities under the FPA.  TVA is, however, an "electric utility" and a "transmitting utility" as defined in the FPA and, thus, is directly subject to certain aspects of FERC's jurisdiction. Under the FPA, for example, TVA (1) must comply with certain standards designed to maintain transmission system reliability; (2) can be ordered to interconnect its transmission facilities with the electrical facilities of independent generators and of other electric utilities that meet certain requirements; (3) can be ordered to transmit wholesale power provided that the order (a) does not impair the reliability of the TVA or surrounding systems, (b) meets the applicable requirements concerning terms, conditions, and rates for service, and (c) does not implicate the ACPA; (4) could be subject to FERC review of the transmission rates and the terms and conditions of service that TVA provides; and (5) is prohibited from (a) reporting false information on the price of electricity sold at wholesale or the availability of transmission capacity to a federal agency with intent to fraudulently affect the data being compiled by the agency and (b) using manipulative or deceptive devices or contrivances in connection with the purchase or sale of power or transmission services subject to FERC's jurisdiction.

    In addition, the FPA provides FERC with authority (1) to order refunds of excessive prices on short-term sales (transactions lasting 31 days or less) by all market participants, including TVA, in price gouging situations if such sales are through an independent system operator or regional transmission organization under a FERC-approved tariff; (2) to issue regulations requiring the reporting, on a timely basis, of information about the availability and prices of wholesale power and transmission service by all market participants, including TVA; (3) to investigate electric industry practices, including TVA's operations that are subject to FERC's jurisdiction; and (4) to impose civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for each violation of the provisions of the FPA discussed in the prior paragraph that are applicable to TVA. Criminal penalties may also result from such violations. 
    Finally, while not required to do so, TVA has elected to implement various FERC orders and regulations pertaining to public utilities on a voluntary basis to the extent that they are consistent with TVA's obligations under the TVA Act. 

NERC Compliance
TVA is subject to federal reliability standards that are set forth by NERC and approved by FERC. These standards are designed to maintain the reliability of the bulk electric system, including TVA's generation and transmission system, and include areas such as maintenance, training, operations, planning, modeling, critical infrastructure, physical and cyber security, vegetation management, and facility ratings. TVA recognizes that reliability standards and expectations continue to become more complex and stringent for transmission systems. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
TVA operates its nuclear facilities in a highly regulated environment and is subject to the oversight of the NRC, an 

independent federal agency that sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow.  The NRC has broad authority to impose requirements relating to the licensing, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear generating facilities.  In addition, if TVA fails to comply with requirements promulgated by the NRC, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down units, or modify, suspend, or revoke TVA's operating licenses. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Operational Challenges.
Environmental Protection Agency
TVA is subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") in a variety of areas, including air quality control, water quality control, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.  See Environmental Matters below and Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges.
States
The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states, without federal legislative consent, from regulating the manner in which the federal government conducts its activities.  As a federal agency, TVA is exempt from regulation, control, and taxation by states except in certain areas where Congress has clearly made TVA subject to state regulation. See Environmental Matters below.
Other Federal Entities
TVA's activities and records are also subject to review to varying degrees by other federal entities, including the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB").  There is also an Office of the Inspector General which reviews TVA's activities and records.
Taxation and Tax Equivalents
TVA is not subject to federal income taxation.  In addition, neither TVA nor its property, franchises, or income is subject to taxation by states or their subdivisions.  The TVA Act, however, does require TVA to make tax equivalent payments to states and counties in which TVA conducts power operations or in which TVA has acquired properties previously subject to state and local taxation.  The total amount of these payments is five percent of gross revenues from the sale of power during the preceding year excluding sales or deliveries to other federal agencies and off-system sales with other utilities, with a provision for minimum payments under certain circumstances.  Except for certain direct payments TVA is required to make to counties, distribution of tax equivalent payments within a state is determined by individual state legislation.
Environmental Matters
    TVA's activities, particularly its power generation activities, are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws and regulations relating to air pollution, water pollution, and management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other matters. The environmental laws and regulations that have the largest impact on TVA's operations and financial condition are discussed below.
Clean Air Act Programs and Regulations
    National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") for certain air pollutants. The EPA has set NAAQS for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), carbon monoxide, and lead. Over the years, the EPA has made the NAAQS more stringent. Each state must develop a plan to be approved by the EPA for achieving and maintaining NAAQS within its borders. These plans impose limits on emissions from pollution sources, which are applicable to certain TVA generating units, including fossil fuel-fired plants. Areas meeting a NAAQS are designated as attainment areas. Areas not meeting a NAAQS are designated as non-attainment areas, and more stringent requirements apply in those areas, including stricter controls on industrial facilities and more complicated and public permitting processes. TVA fossil fuel-fired plants can be impacted by these requirements. Currently, all TVA generating units are located in areas designated as attainment areas.
    Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. TVA power plants are subject to the EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"). CSAPR addresses air pollution from upwind states in the United States that affect air quality in downwind states and is focused on NOx and SO2. To comply with CSAPR, TVA power plants must obtain one NOx allowance for every ton of NOx emitted during the ozone season. Under a revised version of CSAPR, the Shawnee Fossil Plant ("Shawnee") facility is subject to reduced ozone-season NOx allowances and has been required to surrender most of its allowance inventory. TVA is monitoring forecasted needs and has purchased allowances for the Shawnee facility with plans to continue doing so as needed to comply with the rule in 2023. A longer-term compliance strategy for the facility is being developed that could include a combination of NOx control upgrades, operational changes, and allowance purchases.
27



Proposed Federal Implementation Plan Addressing Regional Ozone Transport for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. On April 6, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed Federal Implementation Plan (“FIP”) to address cross-state air pollution with respect to the 2015 ozone NAAQS, and the comment period was subsequently extended on May 12, 2022. The proposed FIP establishes ozone-season NOx allowance budgets that will apply to TVA electric generating units in Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee, beginning with the 2023 ozone season. It also establishes daily NOx emissions limits applicable to TVA's individual coal-fired units. TVA is currently evaluating potential impacts from this proposal. A compliance strategy for affected facilities in Kentucky and Tennessee could include a combination of NOx control upgrades, operational changes, and allowance purchases.
    Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Electric Utility Units. On January 31, 2022, the EPA proposed reaffirming that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutants ("HAP"), including mercury emitted from steam electric utilities. If adopted in its current form, the EPA's proposed rule addressing HAP would not change TVA’s compliance requirements.
    Environmental Agreements. In 2011, TVA entered into two substantively similar agreements, one with the EPA and the other with Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and three environmental advocacy groups (collectively, the "Environmental Agreements"). To resolve alleged New Source Review claims, TVA committed under the Environmental Agreements to, among other things, take now-completed actions regarding coal units and invest $290 million in certain TVA environmental projects. See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Environmental Agreements, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 
    Acid Rain Program. The EPA's Acid Rain Program is intended to help reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx, which are the primary pollutants implicated in the formation of acid rain. The program includes a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2 emissions from power plants. TVA continues to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions from its coal-fired plants, and the SO2 allowances allocated to TVA under the Acid Rain Program are sufficient to cover the operation of its coal-fired plants. In the TVA service area, the limitations imposed on SO2 and NOx emissions by the CSAPR program are more stringent than the Acid Rain Program. Therefore, TVA does not anticipate that the Acid Rain Program will impose any additional material requirements on TVA.
    Regional Haze Program. The EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which required certain older sources to install best available retrofit technology. No additional controls or lower operating limits are required for any TVA units to meet best available retrofit technology requirements. In 2017, the EPA published the final rule that changed some of the requirements for Regional Haze State Implementation Plans ("SIPs"). Specific impacts on TVA cannot be determined until future Regional Haze SIPs are developed for the next decennial review under the visibility haze provisions of the CAA. States were required to submit their Regional Haze SIPs to the EPA by July 31, 2021. In response to requests from state air pollution control agencies in Tennessee and Kentucky, TVA submitted regional haze analyses for its Cumberland and Shawnee facilities, respectively, to those state agencies. The reports evaluate SO2 emission reduction options for these facilities and will be considered by these state agencies in preparing their Regional Haze SIPs. On August 25, 2022, the EPA issued a final action stating that 15 states, including Kentucky, failed to submit a complete SIP, which triggers a two-year deadline for the EPA to promulgate a FIP for the state unless Kentucky submits, and the EPA approves, a SIP satisfying the visibility protection requirements of the CAA. TVA cannot predict the outcome of the EPA's evaluation of the SIP submitted by Tennessee or the FIP to be developed by the EPA for Kentucky.
    Start Up, Shutdown, and Malfunctions. Opacity, or visible emissions, measures the denseness or color of power plant plumes and has traditionally been used by states as a means of monitoring good maintenance and operation of particulate control equipment. Under some conditions, retrofitting a unit with additional equipment to better control SO2 and NOx emissions can adversely affect opacity emissions, and TVA and other utilities have addressed this issue. The evaluation of utilities' compliance with opacity requirements is coming under increased scrutiny, especially during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Historically, SIPs developed under the CAA typically excluded periods of startup, shutdowns, and malfunctions, but in June 2015, the EPA finalized a rule to eliminate such exclusions ("2015 Rule"). Environmental petitioners and several states filed petitions for judicial review of the 2015 Rule before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit"), and oral arguments were heard on March 25, 2022. Separately, on September 8, 2021, environmental petitioners filed a lawsuit to enforce the SIP calls under the 2015 Rule. On January 12, 2022, the EPA determined that Alabama and Tennessee (Shelby County) failed to submit a revised SIP as required by the 2015 Rule. On June 27, 2022, the EPA entered into a consent decree that would require the agency to take final action on SIP revisions submitted in response to the 2015 SIP call by dates ranging from 180 to 480 days from the date of the consent decree. TVA cannot predict the outcome of future SIP evaluations.
New York Petition to Address Impacts from Upwind High Emitting Sources. In 2018, the State of New York filed a petition with the EPA under Section 126(b) of the CAA to address ozone impacts on New York from the NOx emissions from sources emitting at least 400 tons of NOx in CY 2017 from nine states including Kentucky. The New York petition requests that the EPA require daily NOx limits for utility units with selective catalytic reduction systems ("SCRs") such as Shawnee Units 1 and 4 and emission reductions from utility units without SCRs such as Shawnee Units 2, 3, and 5 - 9. Kentucky utility unit NOx emissions are already limited under CSAPR and are declining, and current EPA modeling projects that no additional requirements to reduce Kentucky NOx emissions are necessary. In 2019, the EPA finalized its denial of New York's petition. The State of New York filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit for judicial review of the EPA's denial of the petition, and in July 2020, the D.C. Circuit vacated the EPA's denial of the petition and remanded the petition to the EPA for reconsideration. Specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined until the EPA takes further action on the petition.
28



    Affordable Clean Energy Rule. In 2019, the EPA finalized the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule addressing greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired units. The ACE rule established guidelines, under Section 111(d) of the CAA, for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired units based on efficiency improvements that can be achieved at those units at reasonable cost. States were then required to adapt these guidelines into individual SIPs to be submitted to the EPA for its approval. Several industry, environmental, and state and local petitioners filed for judicial review of the ACE rule. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE rule. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted the request filed by a coalition of states and other parties to review the D.C. Circuit's decision to vacate the ACE rule. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in West Virginia v. EPA, in which it restricted the EPA's authority to regulate GHG from existing power plants under Section 111(d). The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that Congress did not grant the EPA authority under the CAA to demand generation-shifting to achieve reduction of GHG emissions, but the court did not hold that the EPA is limited in future rulemakings to just the heat-rate improvements that made up the ACE rule. The judgment of the D.C. Circuit was thus reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion. TVA is unable to predict the future course of the litigation on remand, nor the direction that the EPA may take in the future to regulate GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired units. As such, it is not possible at this time to predict the impacts the EPA’s effort to develop a rule to replace the ACE rule will have on the level of GHG emissions control to be required at applicable TVA plants. On September 8, 2022, the EPA announced the opening of a non-rulemaking docket for public comments on the EPA's efforts to reduce GHG emissions from existing fossil-fuel fired electric generating units. Comments may be submitted to the EPA until March 27, 2023.

    New Source Performance Standards. In 2018, the EPA proposed revisions to the 2015 GHG emission standards for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units required under Section 111(b) of the CAA. For coal-fired units, the EPA proposed to revise the current new source standards such that carbon capture and sequestration technology would no longer be necessary to meet the standards of performance that reflect the best system of emission reduction. The resulting limits are less stringent than limits under the 2015 rule and can be met by modern coal-fired units (e.g., supercritical steam generators) in combination with best operating practices, without carbon capture or sequestration. The EPA is not proposing to revise the new source performance standard in the 2015 rule for GHG emissions from gas-fired units. In January 2021, the EPA finalized a significant contribution finding for purposes of regulating source categories for GHGs under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act for electric generating units which was subsequently vacated and remanded. The 2015 GHG emission standards are currently in effect, and on September 8, 2022, the EPA announced the opening of a non-rulemaking docket for public comments on the EPA’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions from new fossil-fuel fired electric generating units. Comments may be submitted to the EPA until March 27, 2023. Any formal rulemaking will have separate opportunities for public comment. In its spring 2022 Unified Regulatory Agenda, the EPA indicated that it is undertaking a comprehensive review of the new source performance standards for GHG emissions from electric utility steam generating units, including a review of all aspects of the 2018 proposed amendments and the requirements in the 2015 rule that the agency did not propose to amend in the 2018 proposal. TVA is unable to predict the direction that the EPA may take in the future to regulate GHG emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed fossil fuel-fired units.
Climate Change
Emissions. Though many of TVA's facilities continue to emit air pollutants, emissions from all TVA-owned and operated units (including small CTs of less than 25 MW) have been reduced from historic peaks. Emissions of NOx and SO2 began being regulated in 1995 and 1977, respectively. Emissions of NOx and SO2 have been reduced by 97 percent and 99 percent, respectively, since their initial year of regulation.

Emissions and Intensity Rates (1) | CY 2021 | CY 2020 
Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)(2) | | 
Total NOx Emissions (MT) | 15,210 | 12,577 
Total NOx Emissions Intensity (MT/Net MWh) | 0.000109 | 0.000094 
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)(2) | | 
Total SO2 Emissions (MT) | 25,226 | 17,082 
Total SO2 Emissions Intensity (MT/Net MWh) | 0.000181 | 0.000127 
Mercury (Hg) | | 
Total Hg Emissions (kg) | 22.3 | 17.5 
Total Hg Emissions Intensity (kg/Net MWh) | 0.0000002 | 0.0000001

Notes
(1) Intensity rates are calculated based on generation from TVA's most recent fiscal year for years indicated and emissions data from the most recent CYs.
(2) Emissions data is consistent with Edison Electric Institute Environmental, Social, Governance and Sustainability Report standards, which are based on metric tons ("MTs"), whereas overall CO2 emission rates and baseline reductions from historical levels are based on short tons.
For CY 2021, TVA's emissions of carbon dioxide ("CO2") from its owned and operated units, including purchased power and REC retirement adjustments which reduce the reportable CO2 emissions, were 50 million tons, resulting in a TVA system average, as delivered, CO2 emission rate of 638 lbs/MWh. This represents a 57 percent reduction in mass carbon emissions 

from 2005 levels.
While TVA continues down the path of lowering emissions, including GHG emissions, there will be fluctuations in TVA's emission numbers. Between CY 2020 and CY 2021, TVA's GHG emissions reflect higher electricity usage in the Tennessee Valley as the region recovered from the effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic and experienced economic growth. Changes in the power supply mix between CY 2020 and CY 2021 also impacted the emissions fluctuation, as TVA continues to make operational decisions to keep the system reliable and deliver low-cost energy.
    Executive Actions. President Biden has issued several executive orders relating to climate change.
On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued EO 13990, "Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis." EO 13990 directs federal agencies to review and revise regulations consistent with broad policy goals to improve public health and the environment, reduce GHG emissions, and prioritize environmental justice.
On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14008, "Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad." EO 14008 seeks to promote safe global temperatures, increase climate resilience, and support low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development by, among other things, (1) using federal procurement authorities to achieve or facilitate (a) a carbon pollution-free electricity sector no later than 2035 and (b) clean and zero-emission vehicles for federal, state, local, and tribal government fleets, (2) putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050, and (3) establishing the Justice40 Initiative, instructing federal agencies to direct 40 percent of the benefit from eligible projects toward disadvantaged communities. 
On May 20, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14030, “Climate-Related Financial Risk,” which calls for a governmental-wide strategy on the disclosure of climate-related financial risk that includes, among other things, the measurement, assessment, mitigation, and disclosure of climate-related financial risk to federal government programs, assets, and liabilities in order to increase the long-term stability of federal operations.
On December 8, 2021, President Biden issued EO 14057, "Executive Order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability," which details the administration’s policy to take a whole of government approach to lead by example to achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. Implementing Instructions for EO 14057 issued in August 2022 provided instructions to federal agencies regarding agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability. Agencies must issue or revise existing agency policies, directives, and guidance, as appropriate, including employee training, to ensure alignment with the goals and requirements of EO 14057.
On September 12, 2022, President Biden issued EO 14082, “Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.” EO 14082 provides that in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, federal agencies shall, as appropriate and to the extent consistent with law, prioritize, among other things, (1) driving progress to achieve the climate goals of the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50 to 52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030, achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035, and achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050, (2) advancing environmental and climate justice through an all-of-government approach, including through the Justice40 Initiative set forth in EO 14008, and (3) promoting construction of clean energy generation, storage, transmission, and enabling technologies through efficient, effective mechanisms that incorporate community engagement.
TVA is voluntarily pursuing multiple policies and programs in the Tennessee Valley that support the goals and policies of these executive orders. See Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions below. TVA must consider executive orders within the context of statutory requirements imposed by Congress when carrying out its mission such as the TVA Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that require power be sold at rates as low as feasible and the use of least-cost resource planning, respectively. TVA performs long-term least-cost resource planning through its Integrated Resource Plan process.
    Paris Agreement. The United States is currently part of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement tracks emissions targets through nationally determined contributions ("NDCs"). Each nation that is a party to the Paris Agreement is asked to prepare five-year, successive NDCs that it plans to achieve. On April 22, 2021, the Biden Administration announced its GHG NDCs for 2030 under the Paris Agreement, and these NDCs establish a new target for the U.S. to achieve a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG pollution in 2030. Specific impacts to TVA cannot be determined at this time.
    Litigation. Climate change issues have been the subject of a number of lawsuits, including lawsuits against TVA, and TVA may be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings for additional information.
    Indirect Consequences of Regulation or Business Trends. Legal, technological, political, and scientific developments regarding climate change may create new opportunities and risks. The potential indirect consequences could include an increase or decrease in electricity demand, increased demand for clean generation from alternative energy sources, and subsequent impacts to business reputation and public opinion. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources above.

    Physical Impacts of Climate Change. Physical impacts of climate change may include, but not be limited to, changing weather patterns, extreme weather conditions, and other events such as flooding, droughts, wildfires, and snow or ice storms, and these events can impact TVA's system in terms of system operability, customer demand, and the health of regional economies. TVA has a Climate Change Action Plan which it updated in 2021 in support of EO 14008. TVA submitted its draft Climate Change Action Adaptation and Resiliency Plan to the White House in May 2021 and its final plan in August 2021. The goal of the action planning process is to ensure TVA continues to achieve its mission and program goals and to operate in a secure, effective, and efficient manner in a changing climate by integrating climate change adaptation efforts in coordination with state and local partners, tribal governments, and private stakeholders. TVA manages the risks proposed by climate change on its mission, programs, and operations within its environmental management processes, though such risks cannot be completely eliminated.
    Actions Taken by TVA to Reduce GHG Emissions. TVA has reduced GHG emissions from both its generation facilities and its other operations. TVA Board actions have focused on further reducing GHG emissions from its generation fleet by evaluating the potential retirement of its coal-fired fleet, increasing its nuclear capacity, modernizing its hydroelectric generation system, increasing natural gas-fired generation, installing emission control equipment on certain of its coal-fired units, increasing its purchases of renewable energy, building solar facilities, and investing in energy efficiency initiatives to reduce energy use in the Tennessee Valley.  Additionally, TVA has invested to increase energy efficiency in its operations and offers renewable energy programs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Renewable Energy Resources. These changes support the broad electrification and carbon emission reduction efforts in other sectors of the economy. There are inherent challenges each year in both operations and asset changes. TVA will not sacrifice reliability at any time, which means that TVA must make certain operational decisions at times to keep the system reliable, possibly impacting annual performance on carbon emissions. Therefore, while TVA continues to strive to lower GHG emissions, there will be fluctuations in TVA’s emission numbers resulting from changes in the power supply mix, weather impacts, economic conditions, and generating unit performance. As TVA evolves its generation portfolio, and after appropriate environmental review under NEPA, the TVA Board could make decisions about the timing, retirement, and replacement of aging fossil units or other expiring capacity, which may further TVA’s CO2 and other emissions reductions. The Environmental Policy also provides additional direction in several environmental stewardship areas related to reducing environmental impacts on the Tennessee Valley's natural resources, including reducing carbon intensity and air emissions.
Renewable/Clean Energy Standards
    Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have established enforceable or mandatory requirements for electric utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources or have established a renewable goal. In 12 of those states and the District of Columbia, the requirement is for a 100% clean electricity standard or goal by 2050 or earlier.  Two states within the TVA service area, North Carolina and Virginia, have mandatory renewable and clean energy goals that, while not applying directly to TVA, do apply to TVA's LPCs serving retail customers in those states.  TVA's policy is to provide compliance assistance to any distributor of TVA power, and TVA is providing assistance to the covered LPCs that sell TVA power in North Carolina. In 2020, Virginia signed into law the Clean Economy Act. This act establishes a mandatory requirement for utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources. At this time, TVA is not impacted by the legislation due to the relatively small amount of electricity that TVA provides in Virginia compared to other utilities. Likewise, the Mississippi Public Service Commission adopted an energy efficiency rule applying to electric and natural gas providers in the state, and TVA is supplying information on participation in TVA's energy efficiency programs to support the covered Mississippi LPCs.  
Water Quality Control Developments
Waters of the United States. In 2015, the EPA and the USACE issued the Clean Water Rule, which redefined waters of the United States ("WOTUS") in the agencies' regulations for the first time since the 1980s and was intended to clarify the regulatory jurisdiction of the EPA and the USACE ("2015 WOTUS Rule"). In April 2020, the USACE and the EPA issued the Navigable Waters Protection Rule ("NWPR"), which established a new regulatory definition of WOTUS and replaced the definition set forth in the 2015 WOTUS Rule. The NWPR was challenged in multiple courts. Two courts vacated the rule; two others declined to vacate it, instead remanding it to the EPA and the USACE. On June 9, 2021, the EPA and the USACE announced their intention to initiate a new rulemaking process to restore the definition of WOTUS that was in place prior to the 2015 WOTUS Rule and to develop a second new rule to establish a new definition of WOTUS. The rule to restore the pre-2015 WOTUS Rule definition was proposed in December 2021, and the EPA has not yet proposed a rule for a new definition of WOTUS. The impact of the rulemaking process cannot be ascertained at this time.
    Cooling Water Intake Structures. In 2014, the EPA released a final rule under Section 316(b) of the CWA relating to cooling water intake structures ("CWIS") for existing power generating facilities. The rule requires changes in CWIS used to cool the vast majority of coal, gas, and nuclear steam-electric generating plants and a wide range of manufacturing and industrial facilities in the U.S.  The final rule requires CWIS to reflect the best technology available ("BTA") for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a CWIS. These new requirements will potentially affect a number of TVA's fossil- and nuclear-fueled facilities and will likely require capital upgrades to ensure compliance. Most TVA facilities are projected to require retrofit of CWIS with "fish-friendly" screens and fish return systems to achieve compliance with the new rule. The rule is being implemented through permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") in Section 402 of the CWA. State agencies administer the NPDES 

permit program in most states including those in which TVA's facilities are located.  In addition, the responsible state agencies must provide all permit applications to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for a 60-day review prior to public notice and an opportunity to comment during the public notice. As a result, the permit may include requirements for additional studies of threatened and endangered species arising from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service comments and may require additional measures be taken to protect threatened and endangered species and critical habitats directly or indirectly related to the plant cooling water intake. TVA's review of the final rule indicates that the rule offers adequate flexibility for cost-effective compliance.  The required compliance timeframe is linked to plant-specific NPDES permit renewal cycles (i.e., technology retrofits), and compliance activities have begun and are expected to continue through the 2028 - 2030 timeframe.
The EPA has never previously applied the requirements under Section 316(b) to hydroelectric facilities. However, on September 30, 2021, EPA Region 10, which covers an area outside TVA’s service area, issued NPDES permits to four hydroelectric plants that include Section 316(b) requirements. In determining the BTA to minimize adverse impacts on the environment using best professional judgment, Region 10 analyzed the existing controls that the hydroelectric facilities were already implementing and concluded that those controls constitute BTA. It is not clear whether this approach will be adopted nationwide or how the BTA standard would be applied to TVA's hydroelectric facilities; accordingly, the specific impacts to TVA from the Region 10 permits cannot be determined at this time.
    Hydrothermal Discharges. The EPA and many states continue to focus regulatory attention on potential effects of hydrothermal discharges. Many TVA plants have variances from thermal standards under Section 316(a) of the CWA that are subject to review as NPDES permits are renewed. Specific data requirements in the future will be determined based on negotiations between TVA and state regulators. If plant thermal limits are made more stringent, TVA may have to install cooling towers at some of its plants and operate installed cooling towers more often. This could result in a substantial cost to TVA.
    Steam-Electric Effluent Guidelines. In 2015, the EPA revised existing steam-electric effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs"), which regulate water discharge pollutants and require the application of certain pollutant control technologies. The 2015 ELGs established more stringent performance standards for existing and new sources and required major upgrades to wastewater treatment options at all coal-fired plants. Compliance with new requirements was originally required in the CYs 2018 - 2023 timeframe, but the EPA delayed the compliance dates for flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater and bottom ash transport water until CYs 2020 - 2023 to allow the EPA time to review and potentially revise the ELGs with regard to these waste streams.
    In October 2020, the EPA issued final revised ELGs for bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater. The primary impact for TVA is on the operation of existing coal-fired generation facilities. The revised ELGs could impact long-term investment decisions being made relative to the long-term compliance and operability of these plants. The revisions may require TVA to install additional wastewater treatment systems for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water, and TVA could incur substantial costs to comply with the new rule.  In addition, the revised ELGs could cause TVA to further reduce utilization of its coal-fired generation facilities or even to decommission such facilities. The revision also includes a subcategory for which Cumberland would qualify that provides TVA greater flexibility in meeting the ELGs. The revision includes two additional subcategories for low utilization units and units that cease coal combustion by the end of CY 2028. TVA is evaluating the applicability of those subcategories to its plants as appropriate. In October 2021, TVA filed Notices of Planned Participation preserving the option for TVA's Bull Run, Cumberland, and Kingston plants to participate in the subcategory for units that cease coal combustion by the end of CY 2028.
Petitions for judicial review of the October 2020 ELG rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (the "Fourth Circuit") and have been consolidated in the Fourth Circuit in the case Appalachian Voices, et al. v. EPA. On August 3, 2021, the EPA announced a supplemental rulemaking to revise the Steam Electric Power Generating Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards. As part of the rulemaking process, the EPA will determine whether more stringent limitations and standards are appropriate and consistent with the technology-forcing statutory scheme and the goals of the CWA. Because this rulemaking could result in more stringent ELGs, the EPA has requested that the Appalachian Voices, et al. v. EPA litigation in the Fourth Circuit be stayed pending the outcome of the supplemental rulemaking process.
Consistent with the 2020 rule, on January 8, 2021, TVA submitted requests to state regulatory authorities to modify NPDES permits for Kingston, Cumberland, Bull Run, Shawnee, and Gallatin Fossil Plant ("Gallatin") to incorporate into the permits limitations in the 2020 rule. The Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection issued a final revised permit for Shawnee in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an additional revision in the second quarter of 2022, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation ("TDEC") issued a final revised permit for Kingston in the first quarter of 2022. TDEC issued a final revised permit for Gallatin in May 2022, and TDEC issued a draft permit for Bull Run in August 2022. TVA anticipates TDEC will issue a draft permit for Cumberland later in 2022.
The Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity administratively appealed the NPDES permit issued for Kingston. See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings — Administrative Proceeding Regarding National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit for Kingston.
    Other Clean Water Act Requirements. As is the case in other industrial sectors, TVA and other utilities are also facing more stringent requirements related to the protection of wetlands, reductions in storm water impacts from construction activities, 

new water quality criteria for nutrients and other pollutants, new wastewater analytical methods, and changes in regulation of pesticide application.
Cleanup of Solid and Hazardous Wastes
    TVA Sites.  TVA historical operations at certain facilities have resulted in releases of contaminants that TVA is addressing, including at TVA's Environmental Research Center at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. TVA has completed several removal, remedial, and characterization actions at the site, as required by a RCRA permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management ("ADEM"). At September 30, 2022, TVA's estimated liability for required cleanup and similar environmental work for those sites for which sufficient information was available to develop a cost estimate was approximately $17 million and was included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. TVA has submitted an application for renewal of the RCRA permit. Although the current permit expired on September 27, 2022, ADEM has determined that TVA's permit application is complete, and the current permit will remain in effect until ADEM issues a new permit. Both the renewal process and the resulting renewed permit may include additional mandates for further remedial activities under RCRA's corrective action authorities. TVA has evaluated the potential impact that a permit renewal could have on its operations and does not believe that the renewal will have any adverse impacts at this time. In addition, the Environmental Research Center has an active groundwater monitoring program as part of a permitted corrective action plan.
    Non-TVA Sites. TVA is aware of alleged hazardous-substance releases at certain non-TVA areas for which it may have some liability. See Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies — Environmental Matters.
    Coal Combustion Residuals. The EPA published its final rule governing CCR in 2015. The rule regulates CCR as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of RCRA and establishes standards for landfill and surface impoundment placement, design, operation, and closure; groundwater monitoring; corrective action; and post-closure care. While states may adopt the rule's requirements into their regulatory programs, the rule does not require states to adopt the requirements. The initial version of the rule provided for self-implementation by utilities and allowed enforcement through citizen suits in federal court. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act subsequently allowed state or federal-based permitting to implement the EPA's CCR rule instead of self-implementation and citizen suits. In 2020, the EPA issued the final Part A revision to its CCR rule. Among other things, the final Part A rule requires unlined CCR surface impoundments to stop receiving CCR and non-CCR wastestreams and to initiate closure or retrofit by no later than April 11, 2021. TVA ceased sending CCR and non-CCR wastestreams to, and initiated closure of, unlined CCR surface impoundments by the specified deadline. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Coal Combustion Residuals — Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities for a discussion of the impact on TVA's operations, including the cost and timing estimates of related projects.

      In addition to the requirements of the EPA's CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. In August 2015, TDEC issued an order that (1) established a process for TDEC to oversee TVA's implementation of the EPA's CCR rule and to ensure coordination and compliance with Tennessee laws and regulations that govern the management of CCR and (2) required TVA to investigate and assess CCR contamination risks at seven of TVA's eight coal-fired plants in Tennessee and to remediate any unacceptable risks.  The TDEC order does not allege that TVA is violating any CCR regulatory requirements nor does it assess TVA penalties.  The TDEC order sets out an iterative process through which TVA and TDEC will identify and evaluate any CCR contamination risks and, if necessary, respond to such risks. TVA submitted to TDEC an environmental assessment report (“EAR”) for Allen in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an EAR for Cumberland in the third quarter of 2022. At TDEC's request, to address a potential data gap, TVA is conducting additional investigation work at Allen around the West Ash Disposal Area and will submit a revised EAR upon completion of that work. TVA is currently conducting environmental investigations for the remaining five sites in accordance with TDEC-approved Environmental Investigation Plans and will submit EARs to TDEC upon completion of the related investigations. Upon TVA's submittal of each EAR, TDEC will review the document and provide comments, and TVA will make revisions until TDEC approves a final EAR for each site. After the EARs are approved, TVA will submit Corrective Action/Risk Assessment Plans that will identify the unacceptable risks and TVA's proposed remediation. It is too early to accurately predict the scope of any remedial activities that may arise as a result of these pending investigations, and as such cost estimates for any required remedies are not possible to predict at this time.
In October 2019, TDEC released amendments to its regulations which govern solid waste disposal facilities, including TVA's active CCR facilities covered by a solid waste disposal permit and those which closed pursuant to a TDEC-approved closure plan. Such facilities are generally subject to a 30-year post-closure care period during which the owner or operator must undertake certain activities, including monitoring and maintaining the facility. The amendments, among other things, add an additional 50-year period after the end of the post-closure care period, require TVA to submit recommendations as to what activities must be performed during this 50-year period to protect human health and the environment, and require TVA to submit revised closure plans every 10 years.
    Groundwater Contamination. The EPA, environmental groups, and state regulatory agencies are increasing their attention on alleged groundwater contamination associated with CCR management activities. As a result, TVA may have to change how it manages CCR at some of its plants, potentially resulting in higher costs. See Part II, Item 7, Management's 

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Initiatives and Challenges — Coal Combustion Residuals — Coal Combustion Residuals Facilities and — Allen Groundwater Investigation and Note 13 — Asset Retirement Obligations.
Environmental Investments
From 1970 to 2022, TVA spent approximately $6.8 billion on controls to reduce emissions from its coal-fired power plants. In addition, TVA has reduced emissions by idling or retiring coal-fired units and relying more on cleaner energy resources including natural gas and nuclear generation.
TVA currently anticipates spending significant amounts on environmental projects in the future, including investments in new clean energy generation including renewables to reduce TVA's overall environmental footprint.  TVA environmental project expenditures could also result from coal-fired plant decommissioning and from effective ash management modernization. Based on TVA's decisions regarding certain coal-fired units, the amount and timing of expenditures could change.  See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above and Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures below.
    SO2 Emissions and NOx Emissions.  To reduce SO2 emissions, TVA operates scrubbers on 18 of its coal-fired units and switched to lower-sulfur coal at certain coal-fired units. To reduce NOx emissions, TVA operates SCRs on 18 coal-fired units, operates low-NOx burners or low-NOx combustion systems on 21 units, optimized combustion on all 25 units, and operates NOx control equipment year round when units are operating (except during start-up, shutdown, and maintenance periods). TVA has also retired 34 of 59 coal-fired units. Except for seven units at Shawnee, the remaining coal-fired units in the TVA fleet have scrubbers and SCRs. See Power Supply and Load Management Resources — Coal-Fired above.
    Particulate Emissions. To reduce particulate emissions of air pollutants, TVA has equipped all of its coal-fired units with scrubbers, mechanical collectors, electrostatic precipitators, and/or bag houses.
    Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Various federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of Commerce, may issue regulations establishing more stringent air and waste requirements, as well as GHG accounting requirements, and these requirements could result in significant changes in the structure of the U.S. power industry, especially in the eastern half of the country. There could be additional material costs if further reductions of GHGs, including CO2, are mandated by legislative, executive, regulatory, or judicial actions and if more stringent emission reduction requirements for conventional pollutants are established. These costs cannot reasonably be predicted at this time because of the uncertainty of these actions. 
Estimated Required Environmental Expenditures

Human Capital Management
People Strategy and TVA's Values
In 2022, TVA employees kept TVA's mission in focus and continued to create a culture that lives up to TVA's values - Safety, Integrity, Inclusion, and Service - all as pandemic headwinds persisted and as a competition for talent ensued. TVA employees collectively came together to address business needs and enable strong performance while serving the 10 million people of the Tennessee Valley.
As part of its People Advantage strategic priority, TVA strives to create a work environment that supports and responds 

to the changing needs of the workforce. People Advantage is one of TVA's five strategic priorities and a multi-year commitment to evolve TVA's culture. The recent pandemic provided TVA the opportunity to demonstrate the importance of employee health, well-being, and retention by establishing action plans to address vaccine mandates and executive orders. TVA continues to strive to effectively demonstrate the value of its human capital and putting its people first by sustaining and evolving these programs. 
The focus on People Advantage, along with the other four strategic priorities of Operational Excellence, Financial Strength, Powerful Partnerships, and Igniting Innovation, allows TVA to fulfill its daily mission of service to the people of the Tennessee Valley. 
TVA's People Advantage priority is anchored on three specific pillars: (1) Inclusion with Diversity ("IwD"), (2) Talent, and (3) Engagement. To help shape an inclusive work environment that values all voices, TVA has intensified its efforts over the past few years to integrate diversity and inclusion into its culture and make its efforts and progress sustainable and a part of TVA's daily operations. Similarly, TVA has promoted a people-focused organization that amplifies and harnesses the energy, power, and creativity of an experienced and talented workforce - one that continues to bring about the best from its people - manifesting itself as a "destination for difference makers" for highly-skilled candidates. TVA is working to cultivate a positive employee experience to heighten workforce engagement. This work is focused on equipping leaders to champion engagement across the enterprise through the understanding and leveraging of employee surveys, workplace flexibility opportunities, and health, safety, and well-being programs.
Management illustrates its commitment to human capital by including a safety metric in its incentive compensation metrics that tracks serious injury incident rate and applies to all eligible participants in TVA’s annual program. Compensation derived from this program is based on TVA performance and individual achievements. As a result, success in measures like safety and similar principles grounded in human capital matters helps TVA meet and exceed its goals in workforce engagement. TVA’s transparency in this area was further illustrated by the inaugural release of its Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility ("DEIA") report and appointment of its first-ever Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer to help elevate the importance and visibility of inclusion and diversity both internally and externally. The DEIA report plays a critical role in TVA's ability to achieve its strategic priorities and to meet the objectives laid out by its People Advantage priorities discussed above, which are anchored in the pillars of IwD, Talent, and Engagement. The DEIA report builds upon TVA's transparency efforts by providing valuable insights into DEIA promotion in the workplace and DEIA promotion across the region and communities served. DEIA promotion in the workplace includes the establishment of TVA's first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, IwD Council, Inclusion as a core value, and a dashboard for People Advantage metrics and for the facilitation of Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") and union partnerships. DEIA promotion across the TVA region and communities served includes Home Uplift, School Uplift, the Community Care Fund, TVA's Supplier Diversity, and Diversity Alliance programs, among others.
Ethics
Ethics and integrity are highly valued at TVA. Since its establishment in 1933, a commitment to ethics has been a part of TVA's DNA. TVA's Ethics & Compliance office aims to help employees make the right decisions for the right reasons and offers guidance when the right decisions may not be clear. The office is focused on educating and creating awareness while also assisting employees with ethical decision-making inside and outside of the TVA workplace. Further, TVA requires all employees and certain contractors to take its annual ethics training and attest to its Code of Conduct, which sets forth standards for adhering to TVA's core values and conducting its affairs with openness, honesty, and integrity every day. In 2022, TVA contracted with Ethisphere® to take a deep dive review of TVA's corporate ethics and compliance program. After this review, TVA became the first federal agency to receive the Compliance Leader VerificationTM certification. 
TVA Board Governance and Oversight
The TVA Board’s People and Governance Committee ("Committee") assists the TVA Board in fulfilling its responsibilities under the TVA Act by overseeing policies and strategies that affect a wide array of people-related programs inclusive of leadership development, culture, engagement, labor relations, safety, communications, compensation, performance incentives, benefits, and well-being. Specifically, the Committee advises the TVA Board in areas of overall Board governance, CEO goals, performance, compensation, and succession planning. Emergent people issues are discussed by this Committee, or in TVA Board briefings, as appropriate. The TVA Board's Audit, Finance, Risk, and Cybersecurity Committee oversees TVA's compliance and ethics programs.
Inclusion with Diversity
In 2020, TVA added Inclusion as one of its core values and adopted IwD as an enterprise-wide transformational strategic element. Since then, IwD has become increasingly integrated into TVA’s daily operations. To accelerate the impact of IwD within TVA and the communities it serves, TVA is working to shape an inclusive work environment that values all voices, recognizes and sustains diversity as an imperative, and leverages the public power model to advance IwD in all TVA communities.

In 2022, TVA's initiatives and accomplishments in promoting diversity and inclusion included the following: 
•Appointed TVA’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer;
•Published TVA’s inaugural DEIA Report;
•Affirmed a shift in performance goals for management and specialist employees for a second year from an "awareness" of inclusion to an action-oriented "demonstration of behaviors" of inclusion;
•Established Inclusion Councils, tasked with developing IwD strategies and plans within each of TVA’s six
strategic business units that align with IwD enterprise strategies and plans;
•Provided the business case for IwD to leaders, highlighting the proven business value of IwD;
•Released a “People Dashboard” to increase transparency into TVA’s progress and performance;
•Initiated an independent assessment to identify people policies, processes, programs, and behaviors that
could be improved to further drive inclusion and equity across TVA;
•Sustained TVA’s inclusion score, which measures sense of belonging, at median of 72;
•Created leadership forums for safe and open conversations about diversity and inclusion, including the
importance of leader commitment and ownership; and
•Maintained CEO accountability for reinforcement of IwD as an enterprise priority through assessment of the
CEO’s individual performance in 2022.
TVA continues to advance IwD in the communities it serves and is enhancing its economic development program support for women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses. TVA has established a Supplier Diversity Stakeholder Advisory Council. One of the priorities of the council is the Supplier Diversity Mentoring Program, which is designed to support and position diverse suppliers seeking to do business with TVA. Specific skills enhancements include: inventory management, technology integration, accounting practices, program implementation, and continuous improvement. In addition, TVA has strengthened and focused IwD in the communities TVA serves, as part of advancing the public power model at TVA. This was accomplished through support of TVA’s regional model, community engagement, and focused partnerships with deliberate outreach to LPCs and community-based organizations.
Employee Resource Groups. TVA is powered by its people and strengthened by its diversity. TVA supports eight ERGs to help strengthen an inclusive culture and make life better for the people it serves:
•ABLED Events — allows TVA employees to bring unique perspectives and gifts together as a united team to celebrate commonalities and differences through "Awareness Benefitting Leaders & Employees about disAbilities" in the workplace.
•ACTion — celebrates and honors the many Asian cultures represented within TVA, from Japan to India, and to the Philippines and beyond. It regularly highlights social events and supports career-enriching workshops.
•African American Voices — provides an avenue for African American and others interested in fellowship and smart career connections within TVA. It promotes mentoring and development opportunities, as well as group workshop events on such topics as personal branding, personal finance, and networking and negotiation skills. 
•New Employee Network — makes life easier for new employees entering a large company. It provides organizational information and cross-functional connections not only on the front-end to new employees but throughout an employee’s tenure at the company.
•Spectrum — highlights the open, accepting, and safe work environment TVA provides for all employees and focuses increasing visibility on educational and social opportunities on LGBTQ+ issues by offering employees a variety of community and professional networking opportunities within the Tennessee Valley.
•TVA & Amigos — provides an avenue for TVA's Hispanic employees and those interested in Latin culture to be involved in professional, educational, and service-oriented events.
•TVA Veterans Association — allows employees unique camaraderie opportunities as they support a wide array of local and national ceremonies and events and is one of the oldest and most active resource groups at TVA, with all branches of the military represented.
•Women Empowered — supports women at all stages of their careers and advocates for the equal rights of all 

female employees across TVA. This extends externally as TVA supports inclusion, networking, and developmental opportunities for girls and young women in local communities.
Together, TVA and its employees collectively champion personal and professional growth through a network of professional, social, and volunteer opportunities made available by each ERG and TVA’s diverse mix of employees. 
Talent
To bring out the best from its people, TVA utilizes a set of business functions that operate together to address the enterprise’s workforce needs around human capital talent selection, organization, development, engagement, and performance.
Attracting and Retaining Talent. TVA is enriched by the diversity of a talented, highly skilled workforce made up of people from all backgrounds. To achieve this, TVA endeavors to ensure that all qualified candidates receive fair consideration for open jobs at TVA and that all employees are encouraged, engaged, and empowered to contribute their talents and time while bringing their authentic selves to work each day. Recruiting efforts also support the strategic element of IwD to build a culture that lives up to TVA's values, as TVA actively recruits employees of all races, colors, sexual orientations, ethnicities, gender identities, abilities, religions, and ages. TVA continues to improve employment opportunities for underrepresented populations within TVA’s workforce, to partner with colleges and universities for internships and recent graduates, and to maintain its status as a top industry employer for military veterans. 
While TVA’s voluntary attrition rate reflects a slight year-over-year rise, it aligns with TVA’s historical rates over the past several years and further aligns with TVA’s projection for 2023 at 2.4 percent. In addition, the TVA voluntary attrition rate in 2021 and 2022 fell well below the national, utility, and government benchmarks. The stability that results from retaining talent is an area of strength that is critical to TVA’s success. TVA believes this is largely attributable to its People Advantage focus, which includes competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits programs, inclusion and well-being programs, flexible workplace practices, and an environment that promotes the retention of its complex and valuable workforce.
Competitive Total Rewards. TVA’s total rewards package is a significant factor in attracting and retaining top talent. TVA’s competitive benefits portfolio supports the values and needs of its employees. TVA provides market-based and competitive compensation which includes an annual incentive plan designed to reward accomplishments against established annual business and individual goals.  All eligible employees participate in TVA's annual incentive plan, including TVA's represented employee population.
Additionally, in support of its cultural commitment to IwD, TVA periodically reviews compensation practices to promote fairness and equity. TVA has engaged third party vendors to conduct independent pay equity analyses and continues to monitor its pay practices and to provide its leaders with tools to assist in making equitable pay decisions.
To support and care for the well-being of employees and their families, examples of comprehensive and competitive benefits currently offered by TVA include:

•medical, vision, dental, life, accident, and disability insurance | •flexible spending accounts•tuition reimbursement | •well-being incentives •employee assistance programs
•behavioral and medical telemedicine | •401(k) retirement | •family caregiving benefits 
•leave donation | •dependent scholarship program | •family building benefits 
•paid time-off | •flexible work schedules | •health savings account 

Development and Training. As TVA continues to adapt to the evolving demands of the industry, it is imperative that it cultivate a work environment that motivates people to do their best work by aligning employee development, skills, and capabilities with what TVA needs to succeed now and in the future. TVA provides multiple training and development opportunities at all employee levels. Those opportunities include:

•individual learning-ability | •team learning | •mentoring 
•career pathing, including rotational development | •professional, technical, and leadership career pathways | •over 6,600 on-line learning courses

TVA also invests in the development of its employees through tuition reimbursement for academic programs aligned with TVA’s business and workforce development needs. In 2022, employees and contractors engaged in over 738,200 hours of training.
Leadership Development and Succession Planning. TVA encourages personal and professional development and has strategic leadership development programs designed to prepare employees to step into leadership positions and to accept the 

additional responsibilities, expectations, and challenges faced by each level of leadership. TVA also has advanced leadership programs designed to further prepare leaders for executive level positions, which require an extensive interview and assessment process for selection. Through TVA’s talent review and succession planning program, 98 percent of director and executive level roles have at least one succession candidate identified, with 94 percent having at least one ready-now succession candidate.
Continuous focus on and support of leadership development is maintained through means such as talent discussions at least annually at every level of the organization, which include attention to developing a diverse leadership pipeline. TVA has established goals for female and people of color representation in leadership and plans to update these goals to continuously improve this representation. 
Engagement
Strong engagement levels impact all TVA strategic priorities. TVA's work in this key area is focused on enhancing the people experience by focusing on the whole person, maximizing engagement and organizational performance, equipping leaders to build an engaged workforce, and advancing the environment for active and ongoing communication between employees and leaders.
Employee Engagement Survey. TVA’s Employee Engagement Survey is a key tool for understanding and leveraging the employee voice. The survey is administered a minimum of twice annually to all employees and measures overall engagement and drivers of engagement. The survey results provide real-time insights and analytics and are compared to a normative database comprised of other relative external benchmarks to help identify strengths and opportunities for improvement. Results from the surveys are shared with employees and used by TVA leadership and business units to improve and monitor progress against People Advantage objectives. Two scores are used as key People Advantage metrics: Engagement, which measures the sense of commitment and involvement, and Inclusion, which measures the sense of belonging at work. 
Workplace Flexibility. As part of its People Advantage strategic priority, TVA strives to create a work environment that is welcoming, supportive, and responsive to the changing needs of the workforce. Recognizing the changing work environment, largely fostered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the strength in performance that was achieved by the workforce in 2021, TVA continued “Reimagining How We Work” with the objective to maximize flexibility and performance. As TVA transitions out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is exploring how to continue to work effectively and deliver on TVA’s mission of service while providing flexibility to a workforce that includes on-site, field, and hybrid workers.
Safety, Employee Health, and Well-being. Safety is one of TVA’s core values. TVA's safety program is based on the fundamentals of a safety management system, which includes management commitment, employee engagement, hazard recognition and control, worksite analysis, contractor safety management, training, review, and continuous improvement. TVA’s safety training aims to educate employees on the elements of the safety program and foster a culture of awareness. In 2022, TVA launched an active shooter training series and enhanced existing programs regarding heat stress and various chemical awareness courses. Employees’ tactical skills and knowledge are enhanced through participation in dynamic learning programs that teach employees how to work together safely. 
Employee engagement is critical to the success of the program. TVA's vital safety behaviors are employee-driven and developed with the collaboration of represented employees, union leadership, and management. As a federal agency, TVA is also required to complete regulatory compliance inspections of its facilities on an annual basis. 
In 2022, TVA Safety expanded efforts to recognize safety successes by recognizing contractors for the first time during the TVA Annual Safety Awards. TVA has also focused on engaging with industry leaders and developing internal safety talent through participation in Middle Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration Council, the American Society of Occupational Safety Professional Executive Forum, and Edison Electric Institute, and appointment to the Department of Labor’s Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health.
TVA has provided support for its employees throughout the pandemic to ensure the retention of valuable talent and to enhance well-being. This support includes implementing emergency back-up care support for child and adult dependents, establishing a mental health advocacy program, providing unlimited Employee Assistance Program sessions, enhancing paid leave, and providing tutoring resources, onsite vaccination clinics, and wellness incentives for vaccinations. TVA’s safety and well-being accomplishments in 2022 include a focus on psychological safety to enable a deeper understanding of how TVA’s response to failure directly impacts employees and their ability to learn and improve, being a recipient of the Meritorious Award for work associated with the Middle Tennessee Federal Field Health and Safety Council, and maintaining top quartile serious injury performance.
Partnerships with Unions. TVA has a long-standing policy of acknowledging and working with recognized representatives of its employees, and that policy is reflected in long-term agreements to recognize the unions (or their successors) that represent TVA employees. TVA’s labor construct is complex and unique. Primarily governed by the TVA Act, its labor population is different from private utility peers, with an influence that has the ability to reach national levels. Neither the federal labor relations laws covering most private sector employers, nor those covering most federal agencies, apply to TVA.

TVA’s labor strategy is critical to the achievement of its strategic priorities as it prepares the workforce for the future. Its employees and contractors are represented by seven collective bargaining agreements and a total of 17 labor unions. This reflects 58 percent of TVA’s workforce, or approximately 6,000 employees. TVA’s partnerships with these unions go back more than 80 years and form the backbone of TVA and its ability to serve the people of the Tennessee Valley.
Recent accomplishments to strengthen the relationship between TVA and its labor unions include integrating union partners in TVA’s comprehensive workforce optimization strategy, in alignment with operational and asset transition strategies that position TVA to meet strategic imperatives over the next decade; renewing the Collective Bargaining Agreement between TVA and the Engineering Association ("EA") through September 2024; establishing the Professionalism, Integrity, Excellence, Relationships, and Service team, which is a union-led partnership between the EA and TVA focused on enterprise issues that could be solved by leaders and employees; and collaborating with union partners in support of “We Work Everywhere to Serve” to provide structured flexibility to TVA’s leaders and represented employees in how employees work.
