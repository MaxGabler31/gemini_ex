ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
PacWest Bancorp, a Delaware corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the BHCA with our corporate headquarters located in Beverly Hills, California. Our principal business is to serve as the holding company for our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pacific Western Bank. References to "Pacific Western" or the "Bank" refer to Pacific Western Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to "we," "us," or the "Company" refer to PacWest Bancorp together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. When we refer to "PacWest" or to the "holding company," we are referring to PacWest Bancorp, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. 
The Bank is focused on relationship-based business banking to small, middle-market, and venture-backed businesses nationwide. The Bank offers a broad range of loan and lease and deposit products and services through 74 full-service branches located throughout the state of California, one branch located in Durham, North Carolina, and numerous loan production offices across the country through our Community Banking, National Lending and Venture Banking groups. Community Banking provides real estate loans, commercial loans, and comprehensive deposit and treasury management services to small and medium-sized businesses conducted primarily through our California-based branch offices. National Lending provides asset-based, equipment, real estate, and security cash flow loans and treasury management services to established middle-market businesses on a national basis. Venture Banking offers loans and a comprehensive suite of financial services focused on entrepreneurial businesses and their venture capital and private equity investors, with offices located in key innovation hubs across the United States. In addition, we provide investment advisory and asset management services to select clients through Square 1 Asset Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank and a SEC-registered investment adviser. 
PacWest Bancorp was established in October 1999 and has achieved strong market positions by developing and maintaining extensive local relationships in the communities we serve. By leveraging our business model, service-driven focus, and presence in attractive markets, as well as maintaining a highly efficient operating model and robust approach to risk management, we have achieved significant and profitable growth, both organically and through disciplined acquisitions. We have successfully completed 29 acquisitions since 2000 which have contributed to our growth and expanded our market presence throughout the United States.
As of December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $25.7 billion, total loans and leases, net of deferred fees, of $18.0 billion, total deposits of $18.9 billion, and stockholders’ equity of $4.8 billion. 
Our Business Strategy
We believe that stable, long-term growth and profitability are the result of building strong customer relationships while maintaining disciplined credit underwriting standards. We continue to focus on originating high-quality loans and leases and growing our low-cost deposit base through our relationship-based business lending. These principles enable us to maintain operational efficiency, increase profitability, increase core deposits, and grow loans and leases in a sound manner.
Our loan and lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, and commercial loans and leases. We pursue attractive growth opportunities to expand and enter new markets aligned with our business model and strategic plans. Additionally, we focus on cultivating strong relationships with private equity and venture capital firms nationwide, many of which are also our clients and/or may invest in our clients. 
Our reputation, expertise, and relationship-based business banking model enable us to deepen our relationships with our customers. We leverage our relationships with existing customers by cross-selling our products and services, including attracting deposits from and offering cash management solutions to our loan and lease customers. We price our deposit products with a view to maximizing our share of each customer's financial services business and prudently managing our cost of funds.
6

Focusing on operational efficiency is critical to our profitability and future growth. We carefully manage our cost structure and continuously refine and implement internal processes and systems to create further efficiencies and enhance our earnings. 
Our management team has extensive expertise and a successful track record in evaluating, executing and integrating attractive, franchise-enhancing acquisitions. We have successfully completed 29 acquisitions since 2000, including the CUB acquisition on October 20, 2017. We will continue to consider acquisitions that are consistent with our business strategy and financial model as opportunities arise.
Depository Products and Services
Deposits are our primary source of funds to support our interest-earning assets and provide a source of stable low-cost funds and deposit-related fee income. We offer traditional deposit products to businesses and other customers with a variety of rates and terms, including demand, money market, and time deposits. We also provide international banking services, multi-state deposit services, and asset management services. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits.
Our branch network allows us to gather deposits, expand our brand presence and service our customers’ banking and cash management needs. In addition, as the banking industry continues to experience broader customer acceptance of on-line and mobile banking tools for conducting basic banking functions we are able to serve our customers through a wide range of non-branch channels, including on-line, mobile, remote deposit, and telephone banking platforms, all of which allows us to expand our service area to attract new depositors without a commensurate increase in branch locations or branch traffic.
 At December 31, 2018, we had ATMs at 59 of our branches located in California. We are part of the MoneyPass network that enables our customers to withdraw cash surcharge-free and service charge-free at over 25,000 ATM locations across the country.  We provide access to customer accounts via a 24 hour seven-day-a-week, toll-free, automated telephone customer service and secure on-line banking services.
At December 31, 2018, our total deposits consisted of $16.3 billion in core deposits, $2.0 billion in time deposits and $0.5 billion in non-core non-maturity deposits. Core deposits represented 87% of total deposits at December 31, 2018, and were comprised of $7.9 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, $2.8 billion in interest-bearing checking accounts, $5.0 billion in money market accounts and $0.6 billion in savings accounts. Our deposit base is also diversified by client type. As of December 31, 2018, no individual depositor represented more than 1.0% of our total deposits, and our top ten depositors represented 7.5% of our total deposits.
We face strong competition in gathering deposits from nationwide, regional, and community banks, credit unions, money market funds, brokerage firms and other non-bank financial services companies that target the same customers as we do. We compete actively for deposits and emphasize solicitation of noninterest-bearing deposits. We seek to provide a higher level of personal service than our larger competitors, many of whom have more assets, capital and resources than we do and who may be able to conduct more intensive and broader based promotional efforts to reach potential customers. Our cost of funds fluctuates with market interest rates and may be affected by higher rates being offered by other financial institutions. In certain interest rate environments, additional significant competition for deposits may be expected to arise from corporate and government debt securities and money market mutual funds. Competition for deposits is also affected by the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another.
Client Investment Funds
In addition to deposit products, we also offer select clients non-depository cash investment options through S1AM, our registered investment adviser subsidiary, and third-party money market sweep products. S1AM provides customized investment advisory and asset management solutions. At December 31, 2018, total off-balance sheet client investment funds were $1.9 billion, of which $1.5 billion was managed by S1AM.

Lending Activities
Our lending activities include real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction and land loans, commercial loans and leases, and a small amount of consumer loans. Our commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans are secured by a variety of property types. Our commercial loans and leases are diverse and generally include various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, venture capital loans to support venture capital firms’ operations and the operations of entrepreneurial companies during the various phases of their life cycles, secured business loans originated through our Community Banking group, and loans to security alarm monitoring companies. Until December 2017, we actively originated cash flow loans used to finance business acquisitions and recapitalizations to various types of borrowers, with greater emphasis on borrowers operating in the healthcare and technology industries. In December 2017, we exited most cash flow lending business lines, and we agreed to sell $1.5 billion of cash flow loans (of which $481.1 million were held for sale at December 31, 2017 and were subsequently sold in the first quarter of 2018). At December 31, 2018, we held $92.5 million of cash flow loans from the lending businesses that we exited.
 We price loans to preserve our interest spread and maintain our net interest margin. Loan interest rates may be floating, fixed, or a combination thereof (“hybrid”) throughout the loan term. The rates on hybrid loans typically are fixed until a “reset” date when the rates then become floating. While we do not actively solicit direct consumer loans, we hold consumer loans, consisting primarily of purchased private student loans originated and serviced by third-party lenders. We also have an additional exposure to consumer loans as many of our lender finance and timeshare loans are secured by the receivables owed to our borrowers by individual consumers.
Some of our loans are participations in larger loans, and these participations may be considered a SNC. A SNC is any loan or commitment to extend credit aggregating $100 million or more at origination ($20 million or more prior to January 1, 2018), committed under a formal lending arrangement, and shared by three or more unaffiliated supervised institutions. The SNC program is governed by an inter-agency agreement among the FRB, the FDIC, and the OCC. These agencies review a selection of SNCs periodically, with such review conducted at the lead or agent bank, and deliver a credit risk rating to the participants holding the loans. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had SNC loans held for investment to 30 borrowers that totaled $840 million and to 55 borrowers that totaled $1.2 billion. 
Real Estate Mortgage Loans and Real Estate Construction and Land Loans
Our real estate lending activities focus primarily on loans to professional developers and real estate investors for the acquisition, construction, refinancing, renovation, and on-going operation of commercial real estate. We also provide commercial real estate loans to borrowers operating businesses at these sites (owner occupied commercial real estate loans), including loans to municipalities, schools and school districts, and non-profit borrowers as part of our tax-exempt lending business line.
 Our real estate secured loans include the following specific lending products:

• | Commercial real estate mortgage. Our commercial real estate mortgage loans generally are collateralized by first deeds of trust on specific commercial properties. The most prevalent types of properties securing our commercial real estate loans are office properties, hotels, retail properties, industrial properties, and various healthcare properties such as skilled nursing facilities and assisted living facilities. The properties are typically located in central business districts across the United States with a significant concentration of collateral properties located in California within our branch footprint. Our commercial real estate loans typically either have interest and principal payments due on an amortization schedule ranging from 25 to 30 years with a lump sum balloon payment due in one to ten years or may have an initial interest-only period followed by an amortization schedule with a lump sum balloon payment due in one to ten years. We also provide commercial real estate secured loans under the SBA's 7(a) Program and 504 Program. Compliant SBA 7(a) loans have an SBA guaranty for 75% of the principal balance. SBA 504 loans are 50% loan-to-value first deed of trust mortgage loans on owner occupied commercial real estate where a second deed of trust is also provided by a nonprofit certified development company. The SBA 7(a) and 504 mortgage loans repay on a twenty-five year amortization schedule.

8


• | Income producing and other residential real estate mortgage. Our income producing and other residential real estate mortgage loans generally are collateralized by first deeds of trust on specific multi-family and other residential properties. The most prevalent types of properties securing our income producing and other residential real estate loans are multi-family, condominium, pooled single-family rental properties, and individual single-family properties. We also purchase multi-family secured real estate mortgage loans from other banks due primarily to the favorable credit risk profile of multi-family loans. When we purchase multi-family loans from other banks, we re-underwrite the loans at time of purchase. Multi-family loans typically repay on a 30-year amortization schedule. We do not typically originate single-family mortgage loans, although we do purchase this type of loan from a third-party lender.


• | Real estate construction and land. Our real estate construction and land loans generally are collateralized by first deeds of trust on specific residential and commercial properties. The most prevalent types of properties securing our construction and land loans are multi-family, condominium, and hotel properties. Construction loans typically finance from 50% to 70% of the costs to construct residential and commercial properties. The terms are generally one to three years with short-term, performance-based extension options. We do not currently originate single-family construction loans, although we do purchase this type of loan from a third-party lender. 

Our real estate portfolio is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, the following:

• | increased competition in pricing and loan structure;


• | the economic conditions of the United States;


• | interest rate increases;


• | decreased real estate values in the markets where we lend;


• | the borrower's inability to repay our loan due to decreased cash flow or operating losses;


• | the borrower’s inability to refinance or payoff our loan upon maturity;


• | loss of our loan principal stemming from a collateral foreclosure; and


• | various environmental risks, including natural disasters.

In addition to the points above, real estate construction loans are also subject to project-specific risks including, but not limited to, the following: 

• | construction costs being more than anticipated;


• | construction taking longer than anticipated;


• | failure by developers and contractors to meet project specifications or timelines;


• | disagreement between contractors, subcontractors and developers;


• | demand for completed projects being less than anticipated; and


• | buyers of the completed projects not being able to secure permanent financing.

Real estate mortgage loans include loans secured by healthcare properties, primarily skilled nursing facilities. In addition to the points above, for a healthcare real estate loan, we evaluate facility clinical compliance and quality of care, assess the loan-to-value using per bed limitations based on market information, and analyze the payor mix and state and federal revenue sources.
Many of the risks outlined above result from market conditions and are not controllable by us. When considering the markets in which to pursue real estate loans, we consider the market conditions, our current loan portfolio concentrations by property type and by market, and our past experiences with the borrower, within the specific market, and with the property type.

When underwriting real estate loans, we seek to mitigate risk by using the following framework:

• | requiring borrowers to invest and maintain a meaningful cash equity interest in the properties securing our loans;


• | reviewing each loan request and renewal individually;


• | using a credit committee approval process for the approval of each loan request (or aggregated credit exposures) over a certain dollar amount;


• | adhering to written loan acceptance standards, including among other factors, maximum loan to acquisition or construction cost ratios, maximum loan to as-is or stabilized value ratios, and minimum operating cash flow requirements;


• | considering market rental rates relative to our underwritten or projected rental rates;


• | considering the experience of our borrowers and our borrowers’ abilities to operate and manage the properties securing our loans;


• | evaluating the supply of comparable real estate and new supply under construction in the collateral's market area;


• | obtaining independent third-party appraisals that are reviewed by our appraisal department;


• | obtaining environmental risk assessments; and


• | obtaining seismic studies where appropriate.

With respect to real estate construction loans, in addition to the foregoing, we attempt to mitigate project-specific risks by:

• | considering the experience of our borrowers and our borrowers’ abilities to manage the properties during construction and into the stabilization periods;


• | obtaining project completion guaranties from our borrowers;


• | including covenants in our construction loan agreements that require the borrowers to fund costs that exceed the initial construction budgets;


• | implementing a controlled disbursement process for loan proceeds in accordance with an agreed upon schedule, which usually results in the borrowers' equity being invested before loan advances commence and which ensures the costs to complete the projects are in balance with our remaining unfunded loan commitments;


• | conducting project site visits and using construction consultants who review the progress of the project; and


• | monitoring the construction costs compared to the budgeted costs and the remaining costs to complete.

SBA 7(a) and 504 program loans are subject to the risks outlined above and the risk that an SBA 7(a) guaranty may be invalid if SBA specific procedures are not followed. We seek to mitigate this risk by maintaining and adhering to additional policies specific to SBA loans which align with SBA requirements.
Commercial Loans and Leases 
 Our commercial loans and leases are diverse and generally include various asset-secured loans, equipment-secured loans and leases, venture capital loans to support venture capital firms’ operations and the operations of entrepreneurial companies during the various phases of their life cycles, secured business loans originated through our Community Banking group, and loans to security alarm monitoring companies.
Our commercial loans and leases include the following specific lending products:

• | Lender finance & timeshare. These are loans to companies used to purchase finance receivables or extend finance receivables to the underlying obligors and are secured primarily by the finance receivables owed to our borrowers. The borrowers include commercial lenders, consumer lenders, and timeshare operators. The primary sources of repayment are the operating incomes of the borrowers and the collection of the finance receivables securing the loans. The loans are typically revolving lines of credit with terms of one to three years with contractual borrowing availability as a percentage of eligible collateral.

10


• | Equipment finance. These are loans and leases used to purchase equipment essential to the operations of our borrower or lessee and are secured by the specific equipment financed. The primary source of repayment is the operating income of the borrower or lessee. The loan and lease terms are two to ten years and generally amortize to either a full repayment or residual balance or investment that is expected to be collected through a sale of the equipment to the lessee or a third party.


• | Other asset-based. These are loans used for working capital and are secured by trade accounts receivable and/or inventories. The primary sources of repayment are the operating incomes of the borrowers, the collection of the receivables securing the loans, and/or the sale of the inventories securing the loans. The loans are typically revolving lines of credit with terms of one to three years with contractual borrowing availability as a percentage of eligible collateral. In conjunction with our healthcare real estate loans, we may provide healthcare operators with asset-based loans secured by healthcare accounts receivable to support working capital needs. 


• | Premium finance. These are loans used to finance annual life insurance premiums and are fully secured by the corresponding cash surrender value of life insurance contracts and other liquid collateral with one year terms that, generally, renew annually. The primary sources of repayment are the cash flow of the borrowers and guarantors, repayment from our loans being refinanced by other lenders, or the application of cash surrender value proceeds to the loans. 


• | Venture capital. These are loans to venture-backed companies or loans directly to venture capital firms. Loans to venture-backed companies support the borrowers’ operations, including operating losses, working capital requirements, and fixed asset acquisitions. The borrowers are at various stages in their development (early, expansion, or late), and are, generally, reporting operating losses. The primary sources of repayment are future additional venture capital equity investments or the sale of the company or its assets. The loan terms are generally one to four years, and the loans are typically secured by a first priority, secured blanket lien on all corporate assets and/or a lien on intellectual property. This loan segment also includes equity fund loans which are loans made directly to venture capital firms, venture capital funds, and venture capital management companies to provide a bridge to the receipt of capital calls and to support the borrowers’ working capital needs, such as the cost of raising a new venture fund or leasehold improvements for new office space. The primary sources of repayment are receipt of capital calls, proceeds from sales of portfolio company investments, and management fees. The loan terms are generally one to four years, and the loans are typically secured by a first position lien on the assets of the business, an assignment of capital call rights and/or an assignment of management fees. 


• | Secured business. These are secured business loans originated through the Community Banking group. The primary source of repayment is the cash flow of the borrowers. The loans can be up to five years and are secured by a specific asset or assets of the borrower.


• | Security monitoring. These are loans to security monitoring companies used to support the operations of companies that provide business and residential security systems and the accompanying alarm monitoring services. Loans to security monitoring companies are secured primarily by the monitoring contracts between the borrowers and their customers. The primary sources of repayment are the operating incomes of the borrowers, proceeds from the sales of security monitoring contracts to other monitoring companies, and proceeds from the sale of the borrowers themselves. The loans are typically revolving lines of credit with terms of one to three years with contractual borrowing availability as a ratio of the total recurring monthly billing amount from eligible monitoring contracts (collateral). Loans to security monitoring borrowers are usually considered leveraged loans. According to regulatory guidance, leveraged loans are typically loans where the proceeds are used for buyouts or acquisitions and where the resulting total debt levels are four or more times the annual adjusted earnings of the borrower. 

11


• | Other lending. Loans aggregated into the category of “Other lending” are various commercial loan types including Community Banking group business loans secured by a blanket lien on the borrowers’ businesses, loans to homeowner associations, loans to municipalities and non-profit borrowers, and SBA 7(a) loans for small business expansion. The primary sources of repayments for the Community Banking group business loans, non-profit borrowers, and SBA 7(a) business expansion loans are the operations of the borrowers. The primary sources of repayment for loans to municipalities are tax collections from their tax jurisdictions. 


• | Cash flow. Until December 2017, we actively originated cash flow loans to finance business acquisitions and recapitalizations to various types of borrowers, with greater emphasis on borrowers operating in the healthcare and technology industries. In December 2017, we exited most cash flow lending business lines, and agreed to sell $1.5 billion of cash flow loans (of which $481.1 million were held for sale at December 31, 2017 and were subsequently sold in the first quarter of 2018). At December 31, 2018, we held $114.1 million of cash flow loans, including $92.5 million from the lending businesses that we exited in December 2017.

 Our portfolio of commercial loans and leases is subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the economic conditions of the United States;


• | interest rate increases;


• | deterioration of the value of the underlying collateral;


• | increased competition in pricing and loan structure;


• | the deterioration of a borrower’s or guarantor’s financial capabilities; and


• | various environmental risks, including natural disasters, which can negatively affect a borrower’s business.

 When underwriting commercial loans and leases, we seek to mitigate risk by using the following framework:

• | considering the prospects for the borrower's industry and competition;


• | considering our past experience with the borrower and with the collateral type;


• | considering our current loan and lease portfolio concentration by loan type and collateral type;


• | reviewing each loan request and renewal individually;


• | using our credit committee approval process for the approval of each loan request (or aggregate credit exposure) over a certain dollar amount; and 


• | adhering to written loan underwriting policies and procedures including, among other factors, loan structures and covenants.

 We actively manage real estate and commercial loans and seek to mitigate credit risk on most loans by using the following framework. 

• | monitoring the economic conditions in the regions or areas in which our borrowers are operating;


• | measuring operating performance of our borrower or collateral and comparing it to our underwriting expectations;


• | assessing compliance with financial and operating covenants as set forth in our loan agreements and considering the effects of incidences of noncompliance and taking corrective actions;


• | assigning a credit risk rating to each loan and ensuring the accuracy of our credit risk ratings by using an independent credit review function to assess the appropriateness of the credit risk ratings assigned to loans;


• | conducting loan portfolio review meetings where senior management and members of credit administration discuss the credit status and related action plans on loans with unfavorable credit risk ratings; and


• | subjecting loan modifications and loan renewal requests to underwriting and assessment standards similar to the underwriting and assessment standards applied before closing the loans.

Consumer Loans
Consumer loans are primarily purchased private student loans originated and serviced by third-parties that are not guaranteed by any program of the U.S. Government. These loans refinanced the outstanding student loan debt of borrowers who met certain underwriting criteria, with terms that fully amortize the debt over terms ranging from five to twenty years. Consumer loans may also include personal loans, auto loans, home equity lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, and other loans typically made by banks to individual borrowers.
Our consumer loan portfolio is subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the economic conditions of the United States and the levels of unemployment;


• | the amount of credit offered to consumers in the market;


• | interest rate increases;


• | consumer bankruptcy laws which allow consumers to discharge certain debts (excluding student loans);


• | compliance with consumer lending regulations;


• | additional regulations and oversight by the CFPB; and


• | the ability of the sub-servicers of the Bank’s student loans to service the loans in accordance with the terms of the loan purchase agreements.

We seek to mitigate the exposure to such risks through the direct approval of all internally originated consumer loans by reviewing each new loan request and each renewal individually and adhering to written credit policies. For all purchased student loans, we monitor the performance of the originator and the enforcement of our rights under the loan purchase agreement.

At December 31, 2018, there were eight individual real estate construction commitments greater than or equal to $100 million with the largest two commitments both being $150.0 million. At December 31, 2018, these eight individual commitments totaled $940.8 million and had outstanding balances that totaled $259.2 million. The projects financed by these commitments were a hotel, office building, five multi-family projects, and a residential condominium complex. For these specific commitments, the average commitment to budgeted projected cost ratio was 51.4%.
At December 31, 2018, our largest individual loan commitment was $155.0 million and we had six individual loan commitments each of $150.0 million. These commitments were for equity fund loans, lender finance loans, and commercial construction loans. At December 31, 2018, our ten largest individual loan commitments totaled $1.5 billion and had corresponding outstanding balances that totaled $732.7 million. These ten largest commitments ranged from $130.0 million to $155.0 million. These commitments were for equity fund loans, lender finance loans, commercial construction loans, other commercial real estate loans, and secured business loans. At December 31, 2017, our ten largest individual loan commitments totaled $908.9 million and had corresponding outstanding balances that totaled $516.2 million. These ten largest commitments ranged from $75.0 million to $110.0 million. These commitments were for residential construction loans, lender finance loans, commercial construction loans, other commercial real estate loans, hospitality loans, and income producing residential loans.
Current Developments
Colorado Market Expansion
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we established executive offices and expanded our loan production capabilities to include Community Banking in the Denver, Colorado area. In January 2019, we hired a Colorado Market President to lead this effort. In February 2019, we applied for a license in Colorado to accept deposits and plan to open a full-service branch in Denver. We intend to follow our existing Community Banking group model of making business and real estate loans to local borrowers funded by low-cost, locally-obtained deposits. 
Financing 
We depend on deposits and external financing sources to fund our operations. We employ a variety of financing arrangements, including term debt, subordinated debt, and equity. As a member of the FHLB, the Bank had secured financing capacity with the FHLB as of December 31, 2018 of $3.7 billion, collateralized by a blanket lien on $5.4 billion of qualifying loans. The Bank also had secured financing capacity with the FRBSF of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 collateralized by liens on $2.7 billion of qualifying loans.

Information Technology Systems
We devote significant financial and management resources to maintain stable, reliable, efficient and scalable information technology systems. Where possible, we utilize third-party software systems that are hosted and supported by nationally recognized vendors. We selectively employ proprietary software systems to support our specialty lending products. We work with our third-party vendors to monitor and maximize the efficiency of our use of their applications. We use integrated systems to originate and process loans and deposit accounts, which reduces processing time, automates numerous internal controls, improves customer experiences and reduces costs. Most customer records are maintained digitally. We also provide on-line, mobile, and telephone banking services to further improve the overall client experience. In 2018, we completed the migration of in-house and outsourced systems for managing customer accounts to an alternative platform to enhance the features and services available to our customers. 
We use an enterprise data warehouse system in order to aggregate, analyze, and report key metrics associated with our customers and products. Data is collected across multiple systems so that standard and ad hoc reports are available to assist with managing our business.
We maintain an information technology strategic plan. This plan outlines how specific solutions support our overall goals, analyzes infrastructure for capacity planning, details migration plans to replace aging hardware and software, provides baseline projections for allocating information technology staff, discusses information security trends and measures, considers future technologies, and provides details on information technology initiatives over the next several years.
Protecting our systems to ensure the safety of our customers’ information is critical to our business. We use multiple layers of protection to control access, detect unusual activity, and reduce risk, including conducting a variety of audits and vulnerability and penetration tests on our platforms, systems and applications, and maintain comprehensive incident response plans to minimize potential risk to operations, and reduce the risk that cyber-attacks would be successful. To protect our business operations against disasters, we have a backup off-site core processing system and comprehensive recovery plans.
Risk Oversight and Management 
We believe risk management is another core competency of our business. We have a comprehensive risk management process that measures, monitors, evaluates, and manages the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our oversight of this risk management process is conducted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its standing committees. The committees each report to the Board and the Board has overall oversight responsibility for risk management.
Our risk framework is structured to guide decisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations in our business. Our risk framework is based upon our business strategy, risk appetite, and financial plans approved by our Board. Our risk framework is supported by an enterprise risk management program. Our enterprise risk management program integrates all risk efforts under one common framework. This framework includes risk policies, procedures, measured and reported limits and targets, and reporting. Our Board approves our risk appetite statement, which sets forth the amount and type of risks we are willing to accept in pursuit of achieving our strategic, business, and financial objectives. Our risk appetite statement provides the context for our risk management tools, including, among others, risk policies, delegated authorities, limits, portfolio composition, underwriting standards, and operational processes.
Competition
The banking business is highly competitive. We compete nationwide with other commercial banks and financial services institutions for loans and leases, deposits, and employees. Some of these competitors are larger in total assets and capitalization, with more offices over a wider geographic area and offer a broader range of financial services than our operations. Our most direct competition for loans comes from larger regional and national banks, diversified finance companies, venture debt funds, and service-focused community banks that target the same customers as we do. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies. Those competitors include non-bank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, financial technology companies, and other financial and non-financial institutions.
16

Competition is based on a number of factors, including interest rates charged on loans and leases and paid on deposits, the scope and type of banking and financial services offered, convenience of our branch locations, customer service, technological changes, and regulatory constraints. Many of our competitors are large companies that have substantial capital, technological, and marketing resources. Some of our competitors have substantial market positions and have access to a lower cost of capital or a less expensive source of funds. Because of economies of scale, our larger, nationwide competitors may offer loan pricing that is more attractive than what we are willing to offer.
Economic factors, along with legislative and technological changes, will have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry. We work to anticipate and adapt to dynamic competitive conditions whether it is by developing and marketing innovative products and services, adopting or developing new technologies that differentiate our products and services, cross marketing, or providing highly personalized banking services. We strive to distinguish ourselves from other banks and financial services providers in our marketplace by providing an extremely high level of service to enhance customer loyalty and to attract and retain business. 
We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through the quality of service we provide to borrowers while maintaining competitive interest rates, loan fees and other loan terms. We emphasize personalized relationship banking services and the efficient decision-making of our lending business units. We compete effectively based on our in-depth knowledge of our borrowers' industries and their business needs based upon information received from our borrowers' key decision-makers, analysis by our experienced professionals, and interaction between these two groups; our breadth of loan product offerings and flexible and creative approach to structuring products that meet our borrowers' business and timing needs; and our dedication to superior client service. However, we can provide no assurance as to the effectiveness of these efforts on our future business or results of operations, as to our continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, and as to sufficiently improving our services and/or banking products in order to successfully compete in the marketplace. 
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 1,833 full time equivalent employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.

Supervision and Regulation 
General
The Company and Bank are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. Such regulation is intended to, among other things, protect the interests of customers, including depositors, and the federal deposit insurance fund, as well as to minimize risk to the banking system as a whole. These regulations are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of our stockholders or other creditors. Described below are elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to our Company or the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described. Changes in applicable law or regulations, and in their application by regulatory agencies, cannot be predicted, and they may have a material effect on the business, operations, and results of our Company or the Bank. The current U.S. political environment adds additional uncertainty to the implementation, scope, and timing of regulatory reforms, including those related to the Dodd-Frank Act.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
As a bank holding company, PacWest is registered with and subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the FRB under the BHCA, and we are required to file with the FRB periodic reports of our operations and additional information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries as the FRB may require.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank including committing resources to support the Bank even at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to do so. Similarly, under the cross‑guarantee provisions of the FDIA, the FDIC can hold any FDIC‑insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC‑insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to such a commonly controlled institution. 
Pursuant to the BHCA, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB before we acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or the ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5 percent of such bank. Pursuant to the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. In reviewing certain merger or acquisition transactions, the federal regulators will consider the assessment of the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, our performance record under the CRA, our compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws, and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities.
Under the BHCA, we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiaries and such other activities that the FRB deems to be so closely related to banking as “to be a proper incident thereto.” We are also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the FRB determines that the activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. The FRB’s approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can be acquired. 
The federal regulatory agencies also have general authority to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Further, as discussed below under “-Capital Requirements,” we are required to maintain minimum ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital to total risk‑weighted assets, and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted quarterly average assets as defined in such regulations. The level of our capital ratios may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters - Dividends” and Note 20. Dividend Availability and Regulatory Matters of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
18

The Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd‑Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory landscape in the United States, including the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body, the FSOC. The FSOC oversees and coordinates the efforts of the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the FRB, SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the FDIC) in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act and the FRB’s implementing regulations impose increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on financial institutions as their size and scope of activities increases. 
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”) was enacted. While the EGRRCPA reduced the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on bank holding companies of our size, including in respect to stress testing, the Dodd-Frank Act nonetheless subjected us to additional significant regulatory requirements. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and our having in excess of $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company and the Bank are subject to the examination and supervision of the CFPB.
Transactions with Affiliates
Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are regulated under federal banking law. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, a bank may enter into “covered transactions” with its affiliates if the aggregate amount of the covered transactions to any single affiliate does not exceed 10 percent of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus or 20 percent of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus for covered transaction with all affiliates. Covered transactions include, among other things, extension of credit, the investment in securities, the purchase of assets, the acceptance of collateral or the issuance of a guaranty. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization.
Dividends and Share Repurchases
The ability of the Company to pay dividends on or to repurchase its common stock, and the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company, may be restricted due to several factors including: (a) the DGCL (in the case of the Company) and applicable California law (in the case of the Bank), (b) covenants contained in our subordinated debentures and borrowing agreements, and (c) the regulatory authority of the FRB, the DBO and the FDIC. 
Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase shares of our common stock is subject to the restrictions set forth in the DGCL. The DGCL provides that a corporation, unless otherwise restricted by its certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends (or repurchase shares) out of its surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or for the preceding fiscal year, as long as the amount of capital of the corporation is not less than the aggregate amount of the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Surplus is defined as the excess of a corporation’s net assets (i.e., its total assets minus its total liabilities) over the capital associated with issuances of its common stock. Moreover, the DGCL permits a board of directors to reduce its capital and transfer such amount to its surplus. In determining the amount of surplus of a Delaware corporation, the assets of the corporation, including stock of subsidiaries owned by the corporation, must be valued at their fair market value as determined by the board of directors, regardless of their historical book value.
Our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase shares of our common stock may be limited by certain covenants contained in the indentures governing trust preferred securities issued by us or entities that we have acquired, and the debentures underlying the trust preferred securities. Generally the indentures provide that if an Event of Default (as defined in the indentures) has occurred and is continuing, or if we are in default with respect to any obligations under our guarantee agreement which covers payments of the obligations on the trust preferred securities, or if we give notice of any intention to defer payments of interest on the debentures underlying the trust preferred securities, then we may not, among other restrictions, declare or pay any dividends with respect to our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock.
19

In addition, notification to the FRB is required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend to our stockholders during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve‑month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. Under such circumstances, we may not pay a dividend should the FRB object until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, prior approval of the FRB is required prior to our repurchasing shares of our common stock. 
In connection with the decision regarding dividends and share repurchase programs, our Board will take into account general business conditions, our financial results, projected cash flows, capital requirements, contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and such other factors as deemed relevant. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends on a quarterly basis or otherwise or to repurchase shares of our common stock. The declaration of dividends by the Company is subject to the discretion of our Board. 
PacWest’s primary source of liquidity is the receipt of cash dividends from the Bank. Various statutes and regulations limit the availability of cash dividends from the Bank. Dividends paid by the Bank are regulated by the DBO and FDIC under their general supervisory authority as it relates to a bank’s capital requirements. The Bank may declare a dividend without the approval of the DBO and FDIC as long as the total dividends declared in a calendar year do not exceed either the retained earnings or the total of net earnings for three previous fiscal years less any dividend paid during such period. Dividends paid by the Bank during the previous three fiscal years exceeded the Bank's earnings during that same period by $28.5 million. Since the Bank had a retained deficit of $643.9 million at December 31, 2018, for the foreseeable future, any further cash dividends from the Bank to the Company will continue to require DBO and FDIC approval. 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity - Holding Company Liquidity” and Note 20. Dividend Availability and Regulatory Matters of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of other factors affecting the availability of dividends and limitations on the ability to declare dividends.
Capital Requirements
We are subject to the comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations known as Basel III. Basel III generally implemented the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards. Basel III became effective for the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015, subject to phase‑in periods for certain of its components and other provisions.
Basel III, among other things, (i) implemented increased capital levels for the Company and the Bank, (ii) introduced a new capital measure called CET1 and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk‑weighted assets, (iii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iv) mandated that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (v) expanded the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under Basel III, for most banking organizations the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non‑cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to Basel III specific requirements.
Pursuant to Basel III, the minimum capital ratios are as follows:

• | 4.5% CET1 to risk‑weighted assets;


• | 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk‑weighted assets;


• | 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk‑weighted assets; and


• | 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on regulatory financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).

20

Basel III also introduced a new “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk‑weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk‑weighted assets, Tier 1 to risk‑weighted assets or total capital to risk‑weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). As of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer is fully phased-in and the Company and the Bank are required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk‑weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk‑weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) total capital to risk‑weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
Basel III provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non‑consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.
Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 commenced on January 1, 2015 and was phased‑in beginning at 40% in 2015, 60% in 2016, and 80% for 2017 and 2018.
Basel III provides a standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk‑weighting categories from the previous four Basel I‑derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk‑sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 
The Company has outstanding subordinated debentures issued to trusts, which, in turn, issued trust preferred securities. The carrying amount of subordinated debentures totaled $453.8 million at December 31, 2018. Under Basel III, none of the Company’s trust preferred securities are included in Tier 1 capital, however $440.2 million of such trust preferred securities was included in Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2018. We believe that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters - Capital” for further information on regulatory capital requirements, capital ratios, and deferred tax asset limits as of December 31, 2018 for the Company and the Bank.
Stress Testing
Though the Company and Bank are no longer required to prepare annual stress tests pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to prepare an annual stress test of our capital, consolidated earnings and losses under adverse economic and market conditions. Our stress test results are considered by the FRB and FDIC in evaluating our capital adequacy and could have a
negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases.
Safety and Soundness Standards
As required by the FDIA, guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and quality, and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines which set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the FDIA. 
21

Deposit Insurance
The Bank is a state‑chartered, “non‑member” bank regulated by the DBO and the FDIC. The Bank accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The applicable limit for FDIC insurance for most types of accounts is $250,000.
Under the FDIC's risk-based deposit premium assessment system, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements that measure the risk each institution poses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The calculated assessment rate is applied to average consolidated assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period to determine the dollar amount of the quarterly assessment. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if, for example, criticized loans and leases and/or other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases. 
During the first quarter of 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing a 4.5 basis points surcharge on the quarterly FDIC insurance assessments of insured depository institutions with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The Bank became subject to the FDIC surcharge on July 1, 2016. The surcharge continued through September 30, 2018, when the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reached 1.36% of insured deposits, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $15.9 million of FDIC assessment expense. 
Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
Incentive Compensation
In 2010, federal banking regulators issued final joint agency guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. This guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive plans administered by the Bank. The guidance notes that incentive compensation programs must (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward, (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including oversight by the Board. The FRB reviews, as part of its regular examination process, the Company’s incentive compensation programs. 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure of incentive based compensation arrangements to regulators. The agencies proposed initial regulations in April 2011 and proposed revised regulations during the second quarter of 2016 that would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities (and additional specific requirements for entities with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion). The general qualitative requirements include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping. 
In August 2015, the SEC adopted final rules implementing the pay ratio provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act by requiring companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer to the median compensation of its employees. Under SEC guidance issued in September 2017, companies such as the Company are able to use widely-recognized tests to determine who counts as an employee under the rule, use existing internal records such as payroll and tax information and describe the ratio as an estimate. For a registrant with a fiscal year ending on December 31, such as the Company, the pay ratio was first required as part of its executive compensation disclosure in proxy statements or Form 10-Ks filed in 2018.
22

Consumer Regulation
We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection regulations may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The Bank is subject to direct oversight and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB has broad supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
USA PATRIOT Act and Anti-Money Laundering
The PATRIOT Act, designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The PATRIOT Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires the Company and the Bank to establish and implement policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti‑money laundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. The PATRIOT Act and its underlying regulations permit information sharing for counter‑terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering a bank holding company acquisition and/or a bank merger act application. 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) drafts regulations implementing the PATRIOT ACT and other anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act legislation. In May 2017, a FinCEN rule became effective which requires financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.
We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to continue to comply with the PATRIOT Act and other anti‑money laundering initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions.
23

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated nationals and others. These rules are based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC‑administered sanctions targeting designated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment‑related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank.
Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA")
The CRA generally requires the Bank to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products, make donations in, and provide services designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires the Bank to maintain comprehensive records of its CRA activities to demonstrate how we are meeting the credit needs of our communities. These documents are subject to periodic examination by the FDIC. During these examinations, the FDIC rates such institutions’ compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the FDIC to take into account the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of all of the communities served, including low‑and moderate‑income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Outstanding” as of its most recent examination. In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company, when applying to acquire a bank, savings association, or a bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA record of each depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application.
In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators recommending changes to the CRA’s regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the CRA regulations.
Customer Information Privacy and Cybersecurity
The FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, non‑public customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements.
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing Internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.

The Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of non-public personal information about consumers to non‑affiliated third parties. The GLBA requires disclosures to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such non-public personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the Bank’s policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions that are distributed regularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank.
State regulators have been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. In June 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “California Privacy Act”), which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Act, which covers businesses that obtain or access personal information on California resident consumers, grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. We expect this trend of state-level activity to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which we operate. For a further discussion of risks related to privacy and cybersecurity, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" included in this Form 10-K.
Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries
S1AM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is subject to its rules and regulations. Following the completion of various studies on investment advisers and broker-dealers required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has, among other things, recommended to Congress that it consider various means to enhance the SEC’s examination authority over investment advisers, which may have an impact on S1AM that we cannot currently assess.
