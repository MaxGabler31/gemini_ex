 Item 1. Business
  
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company” refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are at 212 S. Central, St. Louis, Missouri, 63105, and its telephone number is (314) 512-8650.
  
 The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990’s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land. Over approximately the last 25 years, the Company’s business focus and emphasis changed substantially as it has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts almost exclusively on the disposition of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt.
  
 The Company’s remaining land inventory consists of 6 single family lots, an approximate 7 acre parcel and some other minor parcels of real estate consisting of easements in Citrus County, Florida, which are owned through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sugarmill Woods, Inc. (“Sugarmill Woods”). In addition, Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. (“PGIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 60 acres, but these parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale.
  
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no employees, and all services provided to the Company are through contract services.
