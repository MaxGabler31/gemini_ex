Overview
Stitch Fix is transforming the way people find what they love. 
Stitch Fix was inspired by the vision of a client-first, client-centric new way of retail. What people buy and wear matters. When we serve our clients well, we help them discover and define their styles, we find jeans that fit and flatter their bodies, we reduce their anxiety and stress when getting ready in the morning, we give them confidence in job interviews and on first dates, and we give them time back in their lives to invest in themselves or spend with their families. Most of all, we are fortunate to play a small part in our clients looking, feeling, and ultimately being their best selves.
Stitch Fix operates in the United States and United Kingdom. Since our founding in 2011, we have helped millions of men, women, and kids discover and buy what they love through personalized shipments of apparel, shoes, and accessories. Currently, clients can engage with us in one of two ways that, combined, form an ecosystem of personalized experiences across styling, shopping, and inspiration: (1) by receiving a personalized shipment of items informed by our algorithms and sent by a Stitch Fix stylist (a “Fix”); or (2) by purchasing directly from our website or mobile app based on a personalized assortment of outfit and item recommendations (“Freestyle”). Clients can choose to schedule automatic shipments or order a Fix on demand after they fill out a style profile on our website or mobile app. After receiving a Fix, our clients purchase the items they want to keep and return the other items, if any. Freestyle utilizes our algorithms to recommend a personalized assortment of outfit and item recommendations that will update throughout the day and will continue to evolve as we learn more about the client.
Stitch Fix was founded with a focus on Women’s apparel. In our first few years, we were able to gain a deep understanding of our clients and merchandise and build the capability to listen to our clients, respond to feedback, and deliver the experience of personalization. We have since extended those capabilities into Men’s, Kids, Petite, Maternity, and Plus apparel, as well as shoes and accessories. 
We are successful when we are able to help clients find what they love again and again, creating long-term, trusted relationships. Our clients share personal information with us, including detailed style, size, fit, and price preferences, as well as unique inputs, such as how often they dress for certain occasions or which parts of their bodies they like to flaunt or cover up. Our clients are motivated to share these personal details with us and provide us with ongoing feedback because they recognize that doing so will result in more personalized and successful experiences. This feedback also creates a valuable network effect by helping us to better serve other clients. As of July 30, 2022, we had approximately 3,795,000 active clients. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Financial and Operating Metrics” for information on how we define and calculate active clients.
The very human experience that we deliver is powered by data science. Our data science capabilities consist of our rich data set and our proprietary algorithms, which fuel our business by enhancing the client experience and driving business model efficiencies. The vast majority of our client data is provided directly and explicitly by the client, rather than inferred, scraped, or obtained from other sources. We also gather extensive merchandise data, such as inseam, pocket shape, silhouette, and fit. This large and growing data set provides the foundation for proprietary algorithms that we use throughout our business, including those that predict purchase behavior, forecast demand, optimize inventory, and enable us to design new apparel. We believe our data science capabilities give us a significant competitive advantage, and as our data set grows, our algorithms become more powerful.
With a Fix, we leverage our data science through a custom-built, web-based styling application that provides recommendations to our stylists from our broad selection of merchandise. Our stylists then send the most relevant items from our merchandise to a client in their Fix. Our stylists provide a personal touch, offer styling advice and context to each item selected, and help us develop long-term relationships with our clients.
We offer merchandise across multiple price points and styles from established and emerging brands, as well as our own private labels, which we call Exclusive Brands. Many of our brand partners also design and supply items exclusively for our clients.
Industry Overview
Technology is Driving Transformation Across Industries
Technological innovation has profoundly impacted how consumers discover and purchase products, forcing businesses to adapt to engage effectively with consumers. We believe that new business models that embrace these changes and truly focus on the consumer will be the winners in this changing environment.
The Apparel, Shoes, and Accessories Market is Massive, but Many Retailers have Failed to Adapt to Changing Consumer Behavior
The apparel, shoes, and accessories market is large, but we believe many brick-and-mortar retailers have failed to adapt to evolving consumer preferences. Historically, brick-and-mortar retailers have been the primary source of apparel, shoes, and accessories sales. Over time, brick-and-mortar retail has changed and the era of salespersons who know each customer on a personal level has passed. We believe many of today’s consumers view the traditional retail experience as impersonal, time-consuming, and inconvenient. This has led to financial difficulties, bankruptcies, and store closures for many major department stores, specialty retailers, and retail chains.
eCommerce is Growing, but has Further Depersonalized the Shopping Experience
The internet has created new opportunities for consumers to shop for apparel. eCommerce continues to take market share from brick-and-mortar retail. The first wave of eCommerce companies prioritized low price and fast delivery. This transaction-focused model is well suited for commoditized products and when consumers already know what they want. However, we believe eCommerce companies often fall short when consumers do not know what they want and price and delivery speed are not the primary decision drivers. There is an overwhelming selection of apparel, shoes, and accessories available to consumers online, and standard search bars and filters are poor tools when it comes to finding items that fit one’s style, figure, and occasion. eCommerce companies also lack the critical personal touchpoints necessary to help consumers find what they love, further depersonalizing the shopping experience.
Personalization is the Next Wave
To be relevant today, retailers must find a way to connect with consumers on a personal level and fit conveniently into their lifestyles. Personalization in retail can be difficult and nuanced, as consumers consider many factors that can be difficult to articulate, including style, size, fit, feel, and occasion. We believe that consumers seek personalized retail experiences, which we power through a combination of data science and human judgment.
Competition
The retail apparel industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include eCommerce companies that sell apparel, shoes, and accessories; local, national, and global department stores; specialty retailers; discount chains; independent retail stores; and the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors. Additionally, we experience competition for consumer discretionary spending from other product and experiential categories.
We compete primarily on the basis of client experience, brand, product selection, quality, convenience, and price. We believe that we are able to compete effectively because we offer clients a personalized and fun shopping experience that our competitors are unable to match. See Part I, Item1A “Risk Factors—Our industry is highly competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating results could be adversely affected” for more information.
Our Service
We help millions of clients discover and buy what they love through personalized apparel, shoes, and accessories.
Our Data Science Advantage
Our data science capabilities fuel our business. These capabilities consist of our rich and growing set of detailed client and merchandise data and our proprietary algorithms. We use data science throughout our business, including to style our clients, offer personalized direct buy options, predict purchase behavior, forecast demand, optimize inventory, and design new apparel.
Our data set is particularly powerful because:
•the vast majority of our client data is provided directly and explicitly by the client, rather than inferred, scraped, or obtained from other sources;
•our clients are motivated to provide us with relevant personal data, both at initial signup and over time as they use our service, because they trust it will improve their shopping experience; and
•our merchandise data tracks dimensions that enable us to predict purchase behavior and deliver a more personalized experience.
On average, clients that complete our style profile provide us with over 100 meaningful data points, including detailed style, size, fit, and price preferences, as well as unique inputs such as how often they dress for certain occasions or which parts of their bodies the clients like to flaunt or cover up. Over time, through their feedback on Fixes they receive and Freestyle orders, clients share additional information about their preferences as well as detailed data about both the merchandise they keep and return. Historically, over 80% of our shipments have resulted in direct client feedback. This feedback loop drives important network effects, as our client-provided data informs not only our personalization capabilities for the specific client, but also helps us better serve other clients. In addition, Style Shuffle, an interactive mobile and web-based feature in which participants rate Stitch Fix merchandise and outfits, provides additional data to strengthen our understanding of client tastes and style preferences.
We believe our proprietary merchandise data set is differentiated from other retailers. We encode each of our SKUs with numerous information attributes to help our algorithms make better recommendations for our clients. The information we store for each SKU includes:
•basic data, such as brand, size, color, pattern, silhouette, and material;
•item measurements, such as length, width, diameter of sleeve opening, and distance from collar to first button;
•nuanced descriptors, such as how appropriate the piece is for a client that prefers preppy clothing or whether it is appropriate for a formal event; and
•client feedback, such as how the item fit a 5’7” client or how popular the piece is with young mothers.
Our algorithms use our data set to match merchandise to each of our clients. For every combination of client and merchandise, we compute the probability the clients will keep that item based on their and other clients’ preferences and purchase history as well as the attributes and past performance of the merchandise. 
Pairing Data Science and Human Judgment
The pairing of data science and human judgment drives a better client experience and a more powerful business model. Our advanced data science capabilities harness the power of our data for our stylists and clients by generating predictive recommendations to streamline the curation process, and in the case of Freestyle, generate highly personalized items and outfit recommendations in near real-time. For clients who prefer the assistance of a stylist, these stylists add a critical layer of contextual, human decision making that augments and improves our algorithms’ selections and creates the ultimate personalization experience. 
Our Differentiated Value Proposition
Our Value Proposition to Clients
Our clients love our service for many reasons. We help clients find apparel, shoes, and accessories that they love in a way that is convenient and fun. We save our clients time by presenting them with a personalized shopping experience and expert styling advice they can trust, whether through Freestyle or a Fix. We believe our personalization capability removes the frustration of endlessly scrolling through hundreds of items that clients experience on other eCommerce platforms.
Clients also value the quality and diversity of our merchandise as we deliver the familiar brands they know, offer items they can’t find anywhere else, and expand their fashion palette by exposing them to new brands and styles they might not have tried. We proudly serve women, men, and kids across ages, sizes, tastes, geographies, and price preferences.
Our Value Proposition to Brand Partners
We believe that we are a preferred channel for our brand partners. By introducing our clients to brands they may not have shopped for, we help our brand partners reach clients they may not have otherwise reached. Further, we provide our brand partners with insights based on client feedback that help our brand partners improve and evolve their merchandise to better meet consumer demand.
Our Strengths
Since we were founded in 2011, we have shipped millions of orders to our clients. We have achieved this success due to our following key strengths:
•our rich client and merchandise data;
•our expert data science team and proprietary and predictive algorithms; and
•our team of expert stylists.
Our Strategy
We aim to transform the way people find what they love. We plan to achieve this goal by continuing to:
•expand our relationships with existing clients;
•acquire new clients; and
•expand our addressable market.
How it Works
Clients can engage with us in two ways that, when combined, form an ecosystem of personalized experiences across styling, shopping, and inspiration. The first is the “Fix,” a personalized shipment of items informed by algorithms and sent by a Stitch Fix Stylist. The second is “Freestyle,” an online assortment of apparel, shoes, and accessories personalized to each client from which the client can purchase.
A Fix is a Stitch Fix-branded box containing a personalized assortment of apparel, shoes, and accessories informed by our algorithms and sent by Stitch Fix stylists and delivered to the clients to try on in the comfort of their own homes. They can keep some, all, or none of the items in the Fix and easily return any items in a prepaid-postage bag provided in the Fix. In each Fix, a stylist sends a client items from a broad range of merchandise recommended for the client by our algorithms. These algorithmic recommendations are based on the clients’ personal style profile, their own order behavior, the aggregate historical behavior of our client base, and the aggregate historical data we have collected on each item of merchandise we have available.
