Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
We are primarily engaged in acquiring and exploring mineral properties plus the development of mineral resources for mining with the intent of applying green innovation plus renewable energy and technology to traditional mining methods.
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2005, under the name “Nava Resources, Inc.” for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration activities. We were authorized to issue 400,000,000 shares of common stock, having a par value of $0.001 per share. On January 4, 2007, we obtained written consent from our shareholders to amend our Articles of Incorporation to change the par value of our common stock from $0.001 to $0.00001 per share, which change was effected on February 28, 2007. Effective July 30, 2013, we changed our name from “Nava Resources, Inc.” to “Blox Inc.”.

Description of Property
 
Mansounia Property, Guinea, West Africa
 
On August 6, 2014, the Company announced that it had entered into a Deed of Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated July 24, 2014 (the “Assumption Agreement”) with Joseph Boampong Memorial Institute Ltd. (“JBMIL”) and Equus Mining Ltd. (“EML”), Burey Gold Guinee sarl (“BGGs”) and Burey Gold Limited (“BGL”) and, collectively with EML and BGGs, (the “Vendors”), pursuant to which we agreed to assume JBMIL’s right to acquire a 78% beneficial interest in the Mansounia Concession (the “Mansounia Property”) from the Vendors, which right was exercised.
 
In consideration for the acquisition of the interest in the Mansounia Property, we paid $100,000 to BGL and $40,000 to EML and on July 31, 2014, issued BGL and EML an aggregate of 6,514,350 shares of common stock of our company (the “First Tranche Shares”), at a deemed price of $0.1765 per share, for an aggregate deemed value of $1,150,000. The First Tranche Shares were issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively. For accounting purposes, we recorded the cash payment of $150,000 plus $781,722 as the fair value of the First Tranche Shares in mineral interest. The fair value of the First Tranche Shares was based on the closing price of our shares on the OTCQB on July 24, 2014.
 
Within 14-days of commercial gold production being publicly declared from ore mined from the Mansounia Property, we will issue BGL and EML a second tranche of shares of our common stock (the “Second Tranche Shares”). The number of Second Tranche Shares to be issued shall be calculated by dividing $1,150,000 by the volume weighted average share price of our common stock over a 20-day period preceding the issuance date. The Second Tranche Shares shall be issued to BGL and EML in the proportions of 71.43% and 28.57%, respectively.
 
The Mansounia Gold Project lies in the southwest margin of the Siguiri Basin, in the Kouroussa Prefecture, Kankan Region, in Guinea, West Africa and covers a surface area of 145 square kilometres. The Mansounia Property is located approximately 60 kilometres west, by road, from the country’s third largest city, Kankan.
 
An exploration permit for the Mansounia Property was granted by the Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie on August 20, 2013. On December 17, 2017, an exploration permit extension was granted for a period of 12-months. The purpose of the extension was to provide time to complete the required feasibility study and environmental impact assessment to, National standards, that will be submitted to Ministre des Mines et de la Géologie and the La Ministre de l’Environnement, des Eaux et Forêts. Work is continuing on the feasibility study, the environmental impact assessment has been completed and we are in discussions with appropriate consultants to commence the community development plan and other remaining documentation. In July 2017, we announced the completion of field activities associated with a detailed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), which concludes a significant stage toward obtaining a Mining License for the Mansounia Gold Project in Guinea.
 
It is our intention to obtain a Mining License, which would give us the exclusive right to mine and dispose of minerals for 15-years, with a possible five-year extension. The Company submitted an application to Ministere des Mines for Mining License on December 7, 2018. On April 30, 2019, the exploration permit expired. On June 13, 2019, the Company made a presentation of a feasibility study to the National Commission as part of the process of obtaining the Mining License. The Company is moving on the next step of fulfilling the government’s recommendations on the feasibility study.
 
The ESIA document is used to communicate and discuss details of the project to all stakeholders, including government departments, environmental and other regulators, local communities as well as current and prospective shareholders. Apart from assessing the project’s environmental impact, the document also covers risk mitigation and potential benefits to local residents. The ESIA is the beginning of an ongoing process of involvement on all social and environmental fronts.
 
We engaged the internationally credentialed SAMEC (Security Africa Mining and Environmental Consulting) based in Conakry, to undertake the field-associated aspects of the ESIA program.
 
Based on the highly encouraging results obtained from historical soils geochemical programs and in-line with recent desktop and field studies undertaken by Spiers Geological Consultants (SGC 2016), a number of key target areas were identified for follow-up field activities. Our understanding of the deposit and surrounding areas continues to grow with each field season, and, to date, robust geological and structural context for the area/s has been developed using modelling software. The model was based on the pre-existing regional geochemical soil and rock chip sampling and drill-hole data from the Mansounia Property area.
 
West African consulting group, Scott-Taylor Ltd., was retained to undertake a thorough site visit as part of the process of further examining the economic potential of the Mansounia Property. Scott-Taylor Ltd. undertook a field visit to the Mansounia Property to focus on areas where significant outcrops exist, in addition to the verification of collar locations for selected previously drilled RC and Diamond holes.

The deep weathering and extensive lateritic cover have resulted in limited outcrop of Birimian lithologies within the project area. Reconnaissance mapping located outcrops of weathered brecciated granitoid, volcano sedimentary and metasedimentary lithologies. A number of outcrops with extensive quartz veining were identified, particularly within the brecciated granitoid and were sampled. Previous structural analysis identified a number of target areas for further exploration. In total, 15 samples were collected for assays during the field visit. Four samples returned gold grades from 0.49g/t to 3.04g/t are shown below.
 

Sample ID | Eastings | Northing | RL | Au (ppm) 1 | Au (ppm) 2
----------+----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------
Man002 | 415153 | 1141509 | 424 | 1.03 | 0.92 
Man003 | 415155 | 1141509 | 424 | 3.08 | 3.00 
Man007 | 415172 | 1141545 | 441 | 0.49 | 0.48 
Man012 | 415103 | 1141596 | 419 | 1.04 | 1.02 

 
These outcrop sampling assays were very encouraging and warranted further exploration to unlock the full potential of the Mansounia license area. As a result, an auger drilling program was designed and implemented with the assistance of Sahara Natural Resources. The new drilling target was defined after an extensive database compilation and exploration targeting exercise undertaken by Sahara Natural Resources on the historical data held by Blox in the region. Sahara is the largest exploration services group in West Africa with 200 geoscientists operating between Burkina Faso, Ghana, Cote D’Ivoire, Mali, Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea.
 
On July 6, 2018, the Company announced that a new drilling target had been defined by a 2.5km long Gold in Soil anomaly, defined by Sahara, at the Mansounia Gold Project. This area formed part of a thorough auger drilling and regolith mapping program designed to aid in the delineation of potential mineralization 5km south-east of the current existing resource. Field activities also included trenching and pitting across the area of anomalous soil and outcrop samples. Some extensional auger drilling to the south west of the existing resource was also conducted. As Blox is currently moving towards a mining license at the Mansounia Gold Project, the auger drilling was also intended to sterilise a portion of the concession for feasibility work.
 
On October 26, 2018, Blox announced that 2500-meters of auger drilling had been completed. The results identified five new gold targets, including doubling the previous gold-in-soil strike from 2.5km to 5km (identified as Target C in Figure 1 below). In addition, the existing Mansounia resource was extended by up to 1km. Results from across the northern and eastern portions of the concession returned highly anomalous results of up to 1526ppb gold.
 
The Mansounia South target has never had modern drilling completed. The 5km anomaly remains untested and open to the north and south. Blox will continue to explore the strike extensions with auger drilling to refine targets to enable resource drilling to follow up. Extensional soil and auger drilling completed to the south west of the existing 1.29-million ounce resource identified highly anomalous gold contiguous with current drilling. The targets A, B, C, D and E in Figure 1 have never been drilled. Target A is an extension to the current resource and is open to the south. Targets B, C, D and E are open to the north and south. Additional auger drilling will be completed in the hope of further extending these targets.

In total, 184 auger drill samples were taken from the planned 400-hole program. The laterite cap was in excess of 10m deep in most drill locations, instead of the 5m cover anticipated. As a result, it was not possible to complete all 400 planned holes before the onset of the wet season made further drilling impossible. Despite the slightly truncated program, positive drill results were returned from every line drilled. Blox will consider extensional resource drilling at targets A and B below following the closure of the West African wet season.
 
Management is excited about the new drill targets identified and the extensions of the drill ready targets unveiled by the auger drilling. Anomalies were revealed in every drill line commenced, which is a very positive sign. These results have given Blox confidence to move forward with its plans to raise capital to complete the current auger program and then plan high quality resource extensional drilling. The Company is also well advanced towards the submission of its Mining License application for the Mansounia Gold Project.
 
Pramkese, Osenase and Asamankese, Ghana, West Africa
 
On June 22, 2013, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Waratah Investments Limited (“Waratah”) whereby we agreed to purchase all of Waratah’s right, title, and interest in the Quivira Gold (“Quivira”) shares, of which Waratah holds 100% of the outstanding shares. As consideration for the Quivira shares, we agreed to issue to Waratah 60,000,000 shares of common stock and 60,000,000 warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share at $0.05 for a period of five years from the closing date. Quivira, a subsidiary of Waratah, owns and operates gold and diamond mining properties in Ghana.
 
The closing of the agreement was subject to the completion of a private placement financing of up to US$1,500,000, which private placement was completed in April 2018. We issued 30,000,000 units (the “Units”) at a price of US$0.05 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of US$1,500,000. US$1,100,000 of the proceeds were advanced as non-interest bearing loans since 2014 and were utilized to cover general and administrative expenses, as well as to carry out exploration work on our mineral properties. The remaining balance of US$400,000 was received by April 2018. Each Unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one additional common share at a price of $0.05 per share for a term of five years from the date of issuance.
 
Closing the Agreement is also conditional upon receiving legal opinions of Ghana counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Ghana, including corporate and title opinions; the Company receiving legal opinions of Australian counsel confirming various matters relating to the laws of Australia, including corporate and title opinions; completion of certain ongoing transactions by Quivira relating to the transfer of title to certain assets and to an assignment of debt; and preparation of U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements for Quivira.
 
Field work on the three Birim region concessions has been ongoing to maintain compliance while the Company’s prime focus is on the Mansounia Gold Project.
 
Our directors conducted their first visit to Ghana in August 2015, when they visited the Birim Region where the three Ghanaian concessions are located. The objective was to carry out a geological reconnaissance over the areas to identify potentially favourable lithologies. The directors inspected the existing field programs in Ghana and oversaw the planning and implementation of programs for the near future.
 
Ashanti Sankofa Inc.
 
In April 2018, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Ashanti Sankofa Inc., a TSX Venture Exchange listed company trading under the symbol “ASI” (“Ashanti”). Pursuant to the terms of the Strategic Alliance Agreement both parties have agreed to grant to the other party a right of first refusal to enter into a joint venture on any of their respective properties and/or projects and that any future acquisition of natural resource properties that may be acquired by either party that contains, but is not limited to, gold, precious metals, technology metals or diamonds (“Natural Resource Properties”), the acquiring party will grant to the other party a right of first refusal to participate in a joint venture on such Natural Resource Property, which shall be at the sole discretion of the acquiring party.
 
As part of our strategic alliance with Ashanti, we agreed to collaborate to explore and develop natural resource properties in West Africa, to undertake joint research projects and to consider joint commercial exploitation of any new property or project that may be acquired resulting from their joint research.

The strategic alliance with Ashanti will allow us to make our respective technical expertise in the field of exploration, exploitation and management of natural resources available to the other party.
 
In connection with the strategic alliance with Ashanti, we acquired by way of a private placement transaction, a total of 4,333,333 units in the capital stock of Ashanti for a total cost of CAD$130,000, with each unit consisting of one common share (the “Share”) and one transferable share purchase warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable for a term of two-years at a price of CAD$0.05 per share. 
 
Research and Development Activities
 
In addition to activities associated with the Mansounia Project, we have been involved with research and development studies relating to the other key pillars of the business, namely: technology, energy and expansion in Africa. Management is keen to develop new businesses in these key areas as they form part of our overall mandate. Diversifying into new (non-mining) markets, such as energy and technology, and expanding our presence in Africa offers a range of potential benefits. It is the opinion of management that establishing new revenue streams in several arenas will not only benefit our company as a whole but will also help insulate it from fluctuations in the price of precious metals.
 
We are currently working closely with strategic partners to develop our own, in-house tenement management software system to provide semi-automated, accurate, timely and compliant reporting on our four mining concessions in West Africa. As part of the Quivira Gold acquisition that also included Strategic Marketing Australia and the bespoke ERP software system, Abacus, we also have the right to acquire a 49% interest in Post One, an electronic document transfer system. Although Post One is still in the research and development stage, management believes that it has the potential to fill a gap in the manner in which professionals exchange sensitive and notarised documents and could create a potential future income stream for the Company.
 
Since inception, we have been committed to greening the mining process through the utilization of new, clean and sustainable technologies. Our aim is to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from any future mining operations, where possible and efficacious, to produce ‘green gold’ and market it as such. Initially, this can be partially achieved with the use of alternative energy sources at the mine site and camp. Guinea is the watershed of West Africa and we plan to work with experts to explore the option of investing in hydro-electric power for our Mansounia Property, to initially replace part, and ultimately all, of the conventional diesel power generation or coal-fired grid power that will be utilised in our future operations.
 
We also have a strong commitment to wealth creation, prosperity and education for locals within the catchment areas of our concessions both in Guinea and Ghana. Part of our mandate includes:
 

● | providing education and training to allow locals to gain employment on our future mine sites; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | offering English language and mathematics courses; 
● | providing additional infrastructure such as housing, roads and energy where possible, in accordance with our sustainability goals; and 
● | implementing the United Nations’ 17 goals for Sustainable Development and Growth (UN17 SDG) across all our projects for the benefit of locals and as examples of how green, responsible mining can be carried out.

Competitive Conditions
 
The mineral exploration and development business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other companies exploring for minerals and potentially developing minerals resources into mines. Our Mansounia Gold Project in Guinea is an advanced exploration / predevelopment project, while our Ghana projects are very early stage exploration. As a junior mineral exploration and development company, Blox competes with many companies like ourselves for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for industry human resources such as professional geologists, and service providers.

Government Approvals and Recommendations
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations in West Africa, which govern prospecting, development, exploitation, production, export, taxes, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We intend to secure all necessary permits for the Mansounia Property.
 
Our activities are also subject to various federal and state/provincial laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business with a view to safeguarding public health and the environment and operating in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We will generally be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, rescoping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining operations are completed. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Changes to current laws and regulations in West Africa could in the future require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.
 
Guinea’s National Transition Council (CTN) amended its mining code in April 2013, in an effort to improve its investment record. The amendments brought profit taxes down to 30 percent, and cut the tax on bauxite to 0.15 percent of the international market price for aluminum. However, the new version still grants the government a free 15-percent stake in mining projects, as well as the option of purchasing an additional 20 percent stake. The clause is designed to encourage companies to process raw materials inside the sovereign’s borders, rather than just shipping the ore out. The state’s stake in the projects is said to shrink as the portion of value added inside the country’s borders increases.
 
Under the new mining code, an industrial exploitation or operating permit will be granted for 15 years. It can be renewed for five-year periods, provided the holder of the title complies with its obligations. Upon non-commencement of work within a year of the issuance of an exploitation permit for industrial operations, the previous monthly fine of GNF 5m has been revised to GNF10m, imposed for the first three months, with a monthly increase of 10 percent of the penalty amount thereafter.
 
Mining convention: The granting of a mining concession and an exploitation permit must be accompanied by the mining convention. The maximum duration of a mining convention is 25 years, renewable for one or several periods of 10 years. Mining conventions are subject to an executive order and will be signed by the Minister of Mines, following the advice of the National Mining Committee and the authorization of the Council of Ministers. Mining conventions will then be submitted for the legal opinion of the Supreme Court and ratified by Parliament.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Although we currently have no costs to comply with environmental laws concerning our mineral property, we will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all work undertaken which causes sufficient surface disturbance to necessitate reclamation work.  Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible.  Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits.  Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to a natural state after completion of exploration activities.  Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused, i.e. refilling trenches after sampling or cleaning up fuel spills.  At this time, we do not require any reclamation or remediation other than minor clean up and removal of supplies because of minimal disturbance to the ground.  The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program we will undertake.  Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially economic deposit is discovered.
Employees
 
We currently have no employees. Our officers and directors provide consulting services to us on a part time basis. We intend to retain the services of geologists, prospectors and consultants on a contract basis to conduct the exploration programs on our mineral claims and to assist with regulatory compliance and preparation of financial statements.
