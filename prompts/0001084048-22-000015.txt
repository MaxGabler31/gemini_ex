Item 1.    Business
Overview
Ziff Davis, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Ziff Davis”, the “Company”, “our”, “us” or “we”), is a leading provider of internet information and services. Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, entertainment, and health and wellness markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and businesses including cybersecurity, privacy and marketing technology. 
Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees. Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses generate revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees. 
In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets. 
Our consolidated revenues are currently generated primarily from two basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business is driven primarily by subscription revenues, with relatively stable and predictable margins from quarter to quarter. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the variability of our revenues. 
In March 2022, Ziff Davis issued its first annual Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Report. Included in the report are the findings from our first GreenHouse Gas inventory, which calculates our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Our ESG efforts focus on five critical pillars: diversity, equity and inclusion; data security and data privacy; environmental sustainability; community engagement; and governance, transparency and accountability. The report highlights the policies, programs and practices Ziff Davis has in place to tackle critical challenges and the tangible results we have already achieved across our business, within our industry, and in our communities. Included in the report are details about several new programs including our Global Mentorship Program, ReStart Returnship Program, and Internal Mobility Program, among others.
Ziff Davis was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure. Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary J2 Global Ventures, LLC. Prior to the spin-off of Consensus Cloud Solutions, Inc. (“Consensus”), our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses were operated by our former wholly owned subsidiary J2 Cloud Services, LLC (formerly J2 Cloud Services, Inc.), which was founded in 1995, and subsidiaries of J2 Cloud Services, LLC. On October 7, 2021 (the “Distribution Date”), the Company completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) of its cloud fax business into Consensus, an independent publicly traded company, and the Company transferred J2 Cloud Services, LLC to Consensus who in turn transferred non-fax assets and liabilities back to Ziff Davis such that Consensus was left with the cloud fax business. In connection with the Separation we changed our name to Ziff Davis, Inc. (“Ziff Davis”) from J2 Global, Inc. (for certain events prior to October 7, 2021, the Company may be referred to as J2 Global) and began trading under the stock symbol “ZD”. The Separation was achieved through the Company’s distribution of 80.1% of the shares of Consensus common stock to holders of Company common stock as of the close of business on October 1, 2021, the record date for the distribution. Before the Separation, we reported our results as Digital Media and Cloud Services. In connection with the Separation, we now refer to these segments as Digital Media and Cybersecurity and Martech, each of which is further described below.
Digital Media
Our Digital Media business operates a portfolio of web properties and apps which includes IGN, RetailMeNot, Mashable, PCMag, Humble Bundle, Speedtest, Offers, Black Friday, MedPageToday, Everyday Health, BabyCenter and What to Expect, among others.

We believe competitive factors relating to attracting and retaining users include the ability to provide premium and exclusive content and the reach, effectiveness, and efficiency of our marketing services to attract consumers, advertisers, healthcare professionals and publishers. We continue to seek opportunities to acquire additional web properties, both within and outside of the technology, shopping, entertainment, and health and wellness verticals, with the goal of monetizing their audiences and content through application of our proprietary technologies and insight.

Competition
Competition in the digital media space is fierce and continues to intensify. 
-6-


Our digital media business competes with (i) diversified internet and digital media companies like IAC/InterActiveCorp, Future PLC, Red Ventures, Internet Brands, (ii) vertical-specific digital media companies like GoodRx, TechTarget, Vox, Centerfield, Doximity, CarGurus and Fandom and (iii) other large sellers of advertising including Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitch and others. We believe that the primary competitive factors determining our success in the market for our digital media include the reputation of brands as trusted sources of objective information and our ability to attract internet users and advertisers to our web properties and our expertise in multiple methods of monetization. Some of these companies may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
For more information regarding the competition that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cybersecurity and Martech
Consumers and businesses of all sizes are increasingly subscribing to cloud-based services to meet their communication, messaging, security, privacy, customer marketing and other needs. Our Cybersecurity and Martech services represent a model for delivering and consuming, real time business technology services, resources and solutions over the internet. Their goal is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security. Our VIPRE security and Inspired eLearning cybersecurity solutions protect our customers from cyber threats with endpoint and email security, threat intelligence and security awareness training. IPVanish provides virtual private networks that encrypt our customers’ data and activity on the internet. Livedrive enables our customers to securely back up their data and dispose of tape or other physical systems. SEOMoz, Kickbox, Campaigner, iContact, and SMTP provide our customers with search engine optimization tools and enhanced email marketing and delivery solutions. eVoice and Line2 provide our customers a virtual phone system with various available enhancements. We believe these services represent more efficient and less expensive solutions than many existing alternatives, and provide increased security, privacy, flexibility and mobility.
We generate substantially all of our Cybersecurity and Martech revenues from “fixed” subscription revenues for basic customer subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, “variable” usage revenues generated from actual usage by our subscribers. 
We market our Cybersecurity and Martech offerings to a broad spectrum of prospective business customers including sole proprietors, small to medium-sized businesses, enterprises and government organizations. We also market our Cybersecurity and Martech offerings to consumers. Our marketing efforts include enhancing brand awareness; utilizing online advertising, search engines and affiliate programs; selling through both a telesales and direct sales force; and working with resellers and other channel partners. We continuously seek to extend the number of distribution channels through which we acquire paying customers and improve the cost and volume of customers obtained through our current channels.
Our Cybersecurity and Martech businesses operate as the VIPRE Security Group and the Moz Group, respectively.

Moz Pro, Moz Local and Stat Analytics offer search engine optimization services that are used to help understand and improve traffic, rankings and visibility in search results. 
Competition
Our Cybersecurity and Martech business faces competition from, among others, email marketing solution providers, marketing automation services, cyber security software and service vendors, and virtual private networks. Our online cybersecurity solutions compete against publicly traded and privately-held providers of cybersecurity solutions and related software, such as NortonLifeLock, Kape Technologies, KnowBe4 and Malwarebytes. Our marketing technology solutions compete directly with various providers of search engine optimization technology and communication platforms that provide email and voice-related services to small- and medium-sized businesses, including companies like SEMRush, MailChimp, The Campaign Monitor group, Constant Contact and Dialpad. Our Cybersecurity and Martech business also competes against diversified and acquisitive vertical market software providers like Constellation Software. Some of these companies may have greater financial and other resources than we do. 
We believe that the primary competitive factors determining our success in the market for our Cybersecurity and Martech include financial strength and stability; pricing; reputation for reliability and security of service; intellectual property ownership; effectiveness of customer support; sign-up, service and software ease-of-use; service scalability; customer messaging and branding; geographic coverage; scope of services; currency and payment method acceptance; and local language sales, messaging and support. 
For more information regarding the competition that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We regard the protection of our intellectual property rights as important to our success. We aggressively protect these rights by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress and trade secrets. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
Through a combination of internal technology development and acquisitions, we have built a portfolio of numerous U.S. and foreign patents. We intend to continue to invest in patents, to aggressively protect our patent assets from unauthorized use and to generate patent licensing revenues from authorized users.
We have generated royalties from licensing certain of our patents and have enforced certain patents against companies using our patented technology without our permission.
We seek patents for inventions that may contribute to our business or technology sector. In addition, we have multiple pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, covering components of our technology and in some cases technologies beyond those that we currently offer. Unless and until patents are issued on the pending applications, no patent rights can be enforced. 
-8-


We have obtained patent licenses for certain technologies where such licenses are necessary or advantageous.
We own and use a number of trademarks in connection with our services, including word and/or logo trademarks for IGN, Everyday Health, BabyCenter, Humble Bundle, PCMag, Mashable, Ookla, Speedtest, and RetailMeNot, among others. Many of these trademarks are registered worldwide, and numerous trademark applications are pending around the world. We hold numerous internet domain names, including “everydayhealth.com”, “retailmenot.com”, “pcmag.com”, “ign.com”, “speedtest.net”, “offers.com”, “humblebundle.com”, “mashable.com”, and “babycenter.com”, among others. We have filed to protect our rights to our brands in certain alternative top-level domains such as “.org”, “.net”, “.biz”, “.info” and “.us”, among others.
Like other technology-based businesses, we face the risk that we will be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and the risk that we will be found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others. For more information regarding these risks, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business over the internet and, in some cases, using services of third-party telecommunications and internet service providers. These include, among others, laws and regulations addressing privacy, data storage, retention and security, freedom of expression, content, taxation, numbers, advertising and intellectual property. With respect to most of our business, we are not a regulated telecommunications provider in the U.S. For information about the risks we face with respect to governmental regulation, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Risk Factors.
Seasonality
Revenues associated with our Digital Media operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations, becoming most active during the fourth quarter holiday period due to increased retail activity. Our Cybersecurity and Martech revenues are impacted by the number of effective business days in a given period. We traditionally experience lower than average Cybersecurity and Martech usage and customer sign-ups in the fourth quarter. 
Research and Development
The markets for our services are evolving rapidly, requiring ongoing expenditures for research and development and timely introduction of new services and service enhancements. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enhance our current services, to respond effectively to technological changes, attract and retain engineering talent, sell additional services to our existing customer base and introduce new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers.
We devote significant resources to develop new services and service enhancements. Our research, development and engineering expenditures were $78.9 million, $57.1 million and $44.7 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For more information regarding the technological risks that we face, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,900 employees, nearly evenly split between U.S. and non-U.S based employees. Our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our highly qualified workforce is very important to our continued success. Approximately 70 of the editorial employees in our Digital Media business have elected to join a union. We chose to voluntarily recognize the union and have negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the union. None of our other employees are represented by collective bargaining.

Acquisition Strategy Impact on Human Capital
Since 2012, we have deployed more than $2.8 billion on more than 80 acquisitions across the globe in a variety of verticals within the internet and software categories. Welcoming and integrating new groups of employees - each group with its own unique culture, organizational norms, and expectations - is a strength of ours. We have developed processes to reduce the human capital risk associated with our acquisition strategy, and we believe that our ability to effectively integrate new employees and businesses is a core competency for Ziff Davis. 
Our Culture
Culture at Ziff Davis operates on two levels. While we have a strong enterprise-wide culture that focuses on our core values – leadership, collaboration, efficiency, innovation, and purpose – we also have a strong network of micro-cultures that operate within many of our businesses and drive their success. Integrating those micro-cultures and values is important; we work hard to foster an environment of collaboration and embrace the power of small groups working together.
An important dimension of the enterprise culture at Ziff Davis stems from our belief that profitability and corporate responsibility go hand in hand. We believe that “Doing is Greater than Talking,” which has been a rallying cry to employees, galvanizing them to take action to create social value and impact. 
With their work and many contributions, our employees play a crucial role in supporting Ziff Davis’s “Five Pillars of Purpose,” which today include:
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion - Reinforce our diverse workforce, reflect our diverse audiences, and extend upon our inclusive culture.
Data - Protect our data and customer data, ensure our product security, and respect the data privacy rights of our users.
Environmental Sustainability - Reduce our environmental footprint and continue helping customers and users reduce their footprint.
Community - Support our employees worldwide and positively impact the communities around us.
Governance - Represent shareholders’ best interests with our rigorous and transparent corporate governance structure.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our digital media audiences and Cybersecurity and Martech services users are diverse – gender, race, ethnicity, age, orientation, geography, education, background, interests, and more. We believe that for our business to succeed over the long term, Ziff Davis must have an inclusive corporate culture that embraces diversity and promotes equity across our enterprise.
We are taking steps to promote that culture. To date, we have:
•created Ziff Davis Council, a diverse group of employees that develops recommendations for recruiting, mentorship, and advancement; 
•supported five Employee Resource Groups to increase opportunities for networking, learning, and development, with more groups to come;
•promoted training and education through our Racism in America speaker series and through expanded mandatory training that includes Managing Bias and Diversity & Inclusion; and 
•introduced DEI targets into our executive compensation program beginning in 2021.
We believe that transparency and accountability are important parts of managing human capital risk. To that end, in 2021 we published our second Annual Diversity Report, available on our website, which details our workforce race representation, gender representation, and details how those differ between our overall workforce and our senior employees, as well as introducing commitments to DEI initiatives within our current and future workforce. We are proud of our progress to date – and we recognize we have much more to do.
-10-


Hiring
We reinforce our culture and our values by seeking out diverse candidates, and looking for candidates that fit well with our organizational priorities. We have had success in this area; 37 percent of all recent new hires have been people of color, and 57 percent of recent new hires in the U.S. have been women. We are working to proactively attract more diverse talent; we have doubled our referral bonus paid to employees when we hire a person of color they recommend, and we are partnering with Jopwell and the Professional Diversity Network to advertise our open roles to employees aligning with a multitude of identity groups. 
Employee Compensation & Benefits
Compensation is an important consideration for all of our employees and we strive to pay competitive compensation packages that reflect the success of the business and the individual contributions of each colleague. We are committed to fair pay practices; roles are periodically benchmarked to help inform where adjustments may be needed.
We care for our employees by providing benefits we believe are effective at attracting and retaining the talent critical for our success and, more importantly, assist in their day to day well-being. Those benefits include comprehensive health insurance coverage and covering 83% of health insurance premiums for covered U.S. employees, an employee stock purchase program, flexible time off, free access to telemedicine, up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave for birth parents, family planning support, 16 hours annually of fully paid Volunteer Time Off, partnering with Benevity to support volunteer event opportunities globally, and a program encouraging personal paths to wellness called “Wellness Your Way.”
Wellbeing
Creating a culture where all colleagues feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our colleagues. In 2020, we introduced a mental health education program which continued with quarterly events throughout 2021. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our colleagues’ health and wellness needs, which we believe is essential to attract and retain employees of the highest caliber, and we offer a competitive benefits package focused on fostering work/life integration.
