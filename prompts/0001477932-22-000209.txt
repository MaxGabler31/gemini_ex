Products
 
SUPR (Superior Utilization of Processing Resources) Product
 
Cytta’s proprietary, secure video compression technology offers, what we believe is, superior streaming in HD/4K/8K as compared to common open standard codec/algorithms. SUPR is an entirely unique, ground-up design that is a patented software codec/algorithm for video compression, which operates differently from MPEG-based codec/algorithms (H.264, H.265, VP9). SUPR performs exceptionally well in bandwidth-challenged environments where other video compression solutions cannot operate or do so poorly. 
 
SUPR delivers video streaming for airborne ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) applications including environments where video streams are transmitted beyond line-of-sight. By utilizing a SUPR-enabled encoder onboard an aircraft, video can be securely streamed in high-definition to a SUPR-enabled decoder. Compared to MPEG-based video compression solutions, SUPR offers the following technological advantages:
 

· | Clear and superior imagery in lower bandwidths 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lossless video stream 
· | Lower video latency 
· | Proprietary video stream 
· | Fewer instances of blocking artifacts and pixilation issues as compared to MPEG-based codec/algorithms (H.264, H.265, VP9) and alternatives
· | Processor operates more efficiently (SUPR utilizes only 2% of calculations per pixel vs. MPEG-based codec/algorithms (H.264, H.265, VP9) 
· | Computer runs cooler during compression due to less processor-intense operation 

IGAN (Incident Global Area Network) Product
 
The IGAN (Incident Global Area Network) ICS (Incident Command System) system is designed to deliver communications composed of multiple streams of voice and video delivered with low latency and viewable by multiple parties over one unified secure communication system. IGAN seamlessly streams all relevant video and audio into a single web (or mobile app) interface. It is designed to work as a common interface for daily operations or can scale up to support hundreds of participants from separate organizations during an emergency. IGAN connects people-to-people, people-to-groups, and facilitates conferences independent of device or location. IGAN offers a distributed and easily customized solution for integrating disparate communications systems in multiple locations into a seamless and rapidly re-configurable solution.

IGAN’s distributed platform architecture allows individual communications systems to be located anywhere that a network connection can be established, and the interconnection of these systems can be controlled from any location or multiple locations. The robust platform is fully redundant such that if a site is lost, a backup is immediately established. IGAN is an IP-software multi-channel / multi-access communications and tactical conferencing solution for professional and mission critical applications. The solution is highly scalable to multiple users, and supports multiple channels and conferences. 
 
IGAN is a secure, advanced ICS (Incident Command System) offering low latency, multidirectional communications, integrating multiple video and voice devices including video cameras, smartphones, tablets, computers, bodycams and 2-way radios. IGAN is a tool for video collaboration when requiring the integration of video feeds from sUAS (Small Unmanned Aerial Systems) unmanned drone operations and any other video source. IGAN is designed to upload a video feed in real-time. It then allows remote participants to not only see low latency remote aerial video, but to guide flight and other source video instruction such as video zoom on a target or areas of inspection.
 
The IGAN ICS system resides in Cytta’s secure cloud or can be privately hosted on a customer’s server. The IGAN hosting architecture is offered two ways: 
 

· | Cytta Cloud; where we manage (but do not store) daily operations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Customer Hosted; where we provide clients with a stand-alone server fully integrated with IGAN software, or we can install on an existing server within the client’s network. IGAN can also be installed in a mobile command vehicle making it a completely mobile solution for remote incident communications.

 
IGAN operating through Cytta’s secure cloud offers secure FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 and is CJIS (criminal justice information services) compliant. 
 
IGAN offers the following technical advantages:
 

· | Creates a unified communications system for sharing video and voice using advanced compression and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | No client application program is required. Utilizes a web browser to join an IGAN session. 
· | Multiple device flexibility in that any video device, 2-way radio, etc. can be added 
· | Offers secure FIPS 140-2 and CJIS compliance 

CYTTA PRODUCT LINES
 
The video compression and streaming product lines are comprised of three main types of products, each aimed at the different phases of selling to and supporting the customer.
Custom Software Development 
 
Custom software development is a type of professional service product. Using software development and product management staff, solutions are created that are either based on a packaged system (and therefore are extensions of an existing product), or are new workflow systems that are intended to work stand alone or possibly in conjunction with other packaged products. Custom software is also developed to add future support to a customer’s system that is not being addressed via standard product upgrades or follow-on product development. Recent examples include adding specific configuration files to a customer’s SUPR software hardware product. Our custom software solutions are compatible with packaged systems, which is accomplished through the use of the common underlying software platform.
Software Maintenance Plans (SMPs) 
 
Our products follow industry norms for high-end software systems. SMPs (Software Maintenance Plans) are comprised of service promises and software upgrades such as the following:
 

· | Phone, e-mail and back-office technical support
--+------------------------------------------------
· | Onsite troubleshooting 
· | Software maintenance releases 
· | Software upgrades

Integrated Portable Hardware/Software Systems
 
Our combined products are designed and built to create complete and integrated systems that are marketed to provide complete portable solutions to client requirements. Our integrated hardware/software products bring advantages to HD, 4K and 4K+ wireless live video streaming and a centralized video/audio interaction system to a variety of industries. 
Competition
 
Current and new competitors may be able to develop and introduce better or more desirable products in advance of us or at a lower cost. In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have longer and/or more established operating histories, greater industry experience, greater name recognition, established customer bases, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. To be competitive, we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change, evolving standards and regulations, and our competitors’ innovations by continually working to improve the design of our products, enhancing our products, as well as improving and increasing our marketing and distribution channels. Increased competition could result in a decrease in the desirability of our products, a decrease in the use of our products by customers, loss of market share and brand recognition, and a reduction in the projected revenues from our products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Competitive pressures faced by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Intellectual Property
 
The original SUPR compression codec/algorithm and related industry knowhow and experience was acquired from Michael Collins, our current Chief Technology Officer, in 2013. Our current SUPR software codec/algorithm video compression technology is wholly owned by Cytta and is sold and licensed to customers, in all product configurations free of any encumbrances or limitations (other than normal software security requirements).
Research and Development
 
To maintain our level of continuous innovation, the Company conducts numerous internal Research and Development projects. Additionally, the unique needs and applications of our customers require that we conduct research and development and engineering in order to provide them with the needed solutions and products.
Employees
 
We currently employ seven (7) independent contractors in the United States to conduct our operations. The Company contracts with various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs, including accounting, investor relations, business development, permitting, and other corporate functions, and may increase staff further as we expand activities and bring new projects to market.
