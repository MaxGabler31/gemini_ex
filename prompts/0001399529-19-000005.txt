ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Dicerna™ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Dicerna”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative, subcutaneously delivered ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) interference (“RNAi”)-based therapeutics using our GalXC™ RNAi platform for the treatment of diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Within these therapeutic areas, we believe our GalXC RNAi platform will allow us to build a broad pipeline of therapeutics designed to have attractive pharmaceutical properties, including a subcutaneous route of administration, infrequent dosing (e.g., dosing that is monthly or quarterly, and potentially even less frequent), high therapeutic index, and target a single gene. Our key development programs include DCR‑PHXC for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria (“PH”), currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial with expected initiation of registration studies in the first quarter of 2019; DCR‑HBVS for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”), currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial; and an undisclosed product candidate against a serious rare liver disease, currently in Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) or Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) enabling studies. Dicerna intends to discover, develop, and commercialize novel therapeutics either on its own or in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners. Dicerna has strategic collaborations with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “Alexion”), and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (“BI”).
All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. Our approach is to design proprietary double-stranded RNA molecules that have the potential to engage the enzyme Dicer and initiate an RNAi process to silence a specific target gene. Our GalXC RNAi platform utilizes a proprietary structure of double-stranded RNA molecules configured for subcutaneous delivery to the liver. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can destroy hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene.
Strategy
We are committed to delivering transformative therapies based on our GalXC RNAi platform to patients with diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. We have qualified dozens of disease-associated genes with clinical indications, in which we believe an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients by providing additional therapeutic opportunities.
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Create new programs in indication areas with high unmet medical need. We intend to continue to use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform to create new, high value pharmaceutical programs. Our areas of primary focus are: (1) rare inherited diseases involving genes in the liver; (2) other therapeutic areas involving the expression of therapeutic gene targets in the liver such as viral infectious diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases; and (3) further leveraging our successes with the GalXC platform to explore non-hepatic therapeutic gene targets.


• | Validate our product candidates and our platform in clinical proof-of-concept studies. On September 5, 2018, we declared attainment of clinical proof-of-concept for DCR‑PHXC (which is in development for all forms of PH) and intend to demonstrate proof-of-concept for our other development programs starting in 2019. Based on precedents in the RNAi field, we are optimistic that our preclinical studies, which showed the significant knockdown of target mRNA activity lasting for up to three months after the last dose and disease biomarker activity, potentially may translate into beneficial clinical results for multiple programs.


• | Retain significant portions of the commercial rights for certain rare disease programs. We seek to retain, subject to the evaluation of potential licensing opportunities as they may arise, a full or substantial ownership stake and to invest internally in diseases with focused patient populations, such as certain rare diseases. These certain rare diseases represent opportunities that carry a relatively higher probability of success, with genetically and molecularly defined disease markets, high unmet need, a limited number of centers of excellence to facilitate reaching these patients, and the potential for more rapid clinical development programs.


• | Enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical companies either for our GalXC RNAi technology platform or specific indications or therapeutic areas. For more complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and larger patient populations, we plan to pursue collaborations that can provide the enhanced scale, resources, and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects, such as our existing collaborative research and license agreements.

5

We may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies across multiple programs or specific indication areas, either before or after clinical proof-of-concept, depending on the attractiveness of the opportunities. These collaborations have the potential to provide us with further validation of our technology platform, funding to advance our proprietary product candidates, or access to development, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities.

• | Expand the reach of GalXC to therapeutic targets beyond the liver. Our research suggests that GalXC compounds developed to target hepatocytes in the liver are broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infectious diseases. Our recent collaboration with Lilly provides both the opportunity to leverage our proprietary GalXC platform in order to generate new medicines for cardiometabolic diseases, and to target additional cell types to establish a presence in new therapeutic areas, including neurodegeneration and pain.


• | Continue to invest in and extend our RNAi technology platform and intellectual property. We plan to continue to invest in expanding and improving our GalXC RNAi platform technology. We have a robust and growing patent portfolio that we believe covers our core technologies and our proprietary GalXC RNAi platform and other RNAi technologies. As of March 4, 2019, our worldwide patent estate, not including the patents and patent applications that we have licensed from third parties, included over 55 issued patents or allowed patent applications and at least 80 pending patent applications supporting commercial development of our RNAi molecules and delivery technologies.


• | Leverage the experience and the expertise of our executive management team. To execute on our strategy, we have assembled an executive management team that has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, various members of our management team and our board of directors have contributed to the progress of the RNAi field through their substantial involvement in companies such as Cephalon Inc., Genta Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer Inc., Sanofi S.A. (“Sanofi”), Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sirna”), and other companies. Our co-founder and chief executive officer, Douglas M. Fambrough III, Ph.D., was a lead venture capital investor and board member of Sirna, an early RNAi company acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) in 2006 for $1.1 billion.

Our GalXC RNAi Technology Platform
The RNAi Therapeutic Modality
All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the mRNA of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. Our GalXC RNAi platform utilizes a proprietary structure of double-stranded RNA molecules configured for subcutaneous delivery to the liver. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can destroy hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene.
RNAi therapeutics represent a novel advance in drug development. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has only developed small molecules or antibodies to inhibit the activity of disease-causing proteins. While this approach is effective for many diseases, many proteins cannot be inhibited by either small molecules or antibodies. Some proteins lack the binding pockets small molecules require for interaction. Other proteins are solely intracellular and therefore inaccessible to antibody-based therapeutics, which are limited to cell surface and extracellular proteins. The unique advantage of RNAi is that, instead of targeting proteins, RNAi silences the genes themselves via the targeted destruction of the mRNAs made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein directly, the RNAi approach is to prevent its creation in the first place.
We believe our approach to RNAi drug development provides the following qualities and has advantages compared to other therapeutic modalities:

• | Our GalXC RNAi platform enables subcutaneous dosing for delivery to the liver. The GalXC RNAi platform is designed to enable convenient subcutaneous delivery for our emerging pipeline of liver-targeted RNAi investigational therapies. The GalXC RNAi platform does not involve lipid nanoparticles (“LNPs”) or other formulation components that facilitate drug delivery, which simplifies the platform and eliminates any requirement for functional excipients. Instead, our GalXC molecules are stabilized by chemical modifications and utilize a four base sequence known as a tetraloop, where each base is conjugated to a simple sugar, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (“GalNAc”), that is specifically recognized by a receptor on the surface of hepatocyte liver cells. With the GalXC RNAi platform, a full human dose may be administered via a single subcutaneous injection. After injection, the GalXC molecules enter the bloodstream and are exposed to the liver hepatocytes expressing the GalNAc receptor. After binding to the receptor, the GalXC molecules are internalized by the hepatocyte, ultimately enabling the GalXC molecules to access the RNAi machinery inside the hepatocyte.


• | Our GalXC molecules have a long duration of action. We believe our GalXC RNAi platform allows us to build a broad pipeline of therapeutics designed to have attractive pharmaceutical properties, including infrequent dosing (e.g., dosing

5

that is on a monthly, quarterly, or an even less frequent basis) due to a long duration of action and higher potency of target gene silencing.

• | Therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver. Our research suggests that GalXC compounds developed to target hepatocytes in the liver are broadly applicable across multiple therapeutic areas, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infectious diseases. Through our recent collaboration with Lilly, we intend to develop a new, non-hepatocyte platform, leveraging our proprietary GalXC platform, in order to generate new medicines for cardiometabolic diseases, and to target additional cell types to establish a presence in new fields, including neurodegeneration and pain.

Optimization of our GalXC molecules
For therapeutic use in humans, our GalXC molecules are optimized both with respect to base sequence and chemical modifications to increase stability and mask them from mechanisms that recognize foreign RNAs, in order to avoid inducing immune system stimulation. Our optimization process begins with an analysis of the target gene sequence using our proprietary GalXC prediction algorithm, which we developed based on the results of testing thousands of sequences for RNAi activity. We select the sequences with the highest predicted RNAi activity and apply patterns of chemical modification, including a GalNAc-linked tetraloop stem-loop structure, which designs in enhanced stability and hepatocyte delivery specificity and engineers out immunostimulatory activity. Our GalXC molecules routinely achieve high potencies, with EC50 values in the liver (i.e., the amount of material required to silence a target gene by 50 percent) typically in the 0.1 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram bodyweight (mg/kg) range in in vivo studies in mice. We have routinely generated GalXC molecules of this potency within 30 days of doing the initial algorithmic gene sequence analysis, which allows us to explore a large number of potential target genes when selecting our programs.
Development Focus
In choosing which development programs to internally advance, we apply the scientific, clinical, and commercial criteria listed below that we believe allow us to best leverage our GalXC RNAi platform and maximize value. We believe that our current development programs meet most or all of these criteria:

• | Strength of therapeutic hypothesis. Our current and future product candidate gene targets are a well understood part of the disease process where a therapeutic intervention is likely to have substantial benefit for the patient.


• | Readily-identified patient population. We seek disease indications where patients can be readily identified by the presence of characteristic genetic mutations or other readily-accessible disease features. In the case of genetic diseases, these are heritable genetic mutations that can be identified with available genetic tests.


• | Predictivity of biomarkers for early efficacy assessment. We seek disease indications where there is a clear relationship between the disease status and an associated biomarker that we can readily measure. This approach will allow us to determine in early stages of clinical development whether our GalXC molecules are likely to have the expected biological and clinical effects in patients.


• | High unmet medical need. We seek to provide patients with significant benefit and alleviation of disease. The indications we choose to approach have high unmet medical need, which is intended to enable us to better access patients and qualify for pricing and reimbursement that justify our development efforts.


• | Rapid development path to approval. To reach commercialization expeditiously and to help ensure our ability to finance development of our product candidates, we have identified indications with the potential for rapid development through marketing approval. We believe that some of our product candidates have the potential to obtain breakthrough therapy designation as well as accelerated review process from the United States (“U.S.”) Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).

We are focusing our efforts on three priority therapeutic programs that currently have a CTA filed, IND filed, or are in enabling studies in preparation to submit additional regulatory applications that will be necessary to initiate clinical trials. We are also focusing our efforts on a series of potential programs in the clinical candidate selection stage, or for which a provisional clinical candidate has been selected that may be elevated into IND/CTA enabling studies in the future, either on our own or in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies. 
Our three priority programs are: DCR‑PHXC for the treatment of PH; DCR‑HBVS for the treatment of chronic HBV infection; and a program for an undisclosed rare disease. Our potential programs include additional rare disease programs, a program for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and multiple programs in various therapeutic areas involving liver function.

DCR‑PHXC for PH
We are developing DCR‑PHXC for the treatment of all types of PH. PH is a family of rare inborn errors of metabolism in which the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate, which in turn causes damage to the kidneys and to other tissues in the body. DCR‑PHXC is currently being investigated in a Phase 1 clinical trial called PHYOX. In non-clinical models of PH, DCR‑PHXC reduces oxalate production to near-normal levels, improving the disease condition.
PH encompasses three genetically distinct, autosomal-recessive, inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by the over-production of oxalate, a highly insoluble metabolic end-product that is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. Patients with PH are predisposed to the development of multiple and recurrent urinary tract (urolithiasis) and kidney (nephrolithiasis) stones. Calculi formation is accompanied by nephrocalcinosis in some patients with PH (PH1 and some patients with PH2). This deposition of calcium oxalate in the renal parenchyma produces tubular toxicity and renal damage that is compounded by the effects of renal calculi related obstruction and frequent superimposed infections. Based on evaluation of genome sequence databases, there may be as many as 16,000 people with PH in the U.S. and major European countries.
PH1, PH2, and PH type 3 (“PH3”), are each characterized by a specific enzyme deficiency. PH1 is characterized by a deficiency of the liver peroxisomal enzyme alanine: glyoxylate-aminotransferase. Patients with PH1 represent approximately 80% of all patients currently diagnosed with PH. PH2 and PH3 are caused by dysfunction of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, respectively. Most patients are diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood. At present, no therapies are approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of patients with PH. A number of supportive therapies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of the effects of the disease. Current medical management before renal failure develops is underpinned by hyperhydration with fluid intake recommendations of at least 3 liters per day per square meter of body-surface area (5 L/day for a 70-kg adult). These regimens can be problematic in infants and toddlers, necessitating placement of a gastrostomy tube to ensure adequate night time fluid administration. Affected patients are at considerable risk of serious complications during periods of increased fluid loss (fever, diarrhea/vomiting, and urinary tract infections) or when oral hydration is compromised (following surgical procedures). Oral potassium citrate administration is used to inhibit crystallization and alkalinize the urine. In PH1, an approximately 30% or greater reduction in urinary oxalate excretion may be achieved with oral vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) administration at doses from 5 to 20 mg/kg in a small proportion of affected patients (10-20% of all PH1 patients).
For patients with more advanced disease, dialysis may be used in an attempt to remove endogenously over-produced oxalate. In contrast to 3 times weekly hemodialysis regimens more typically used in other types of renal failure, patients with PH may require hemodialysis 6 or 7 days per week. Given the limitations of dialysis and the inability to impact oxalate over-production substantially in most patients with PH1, most centers now consider liver transplantation approaches earlier in the disease course to minimize the risk of irreversible tissue damage. Current treatments include renal transplantation or, in PH1, combined liver and kidney transplantation. As with organ transplantation in other disease, these procedures are associated with significant medical risk and a requirement for long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs that are also associated with significant side effects.
We believe that there is a strong rationale for focusing our RNAi technology on the development of product candidates for the treatment of PH. DCR-PHXC, the Company’s lead GalXC product candidate, was associated with normalization or near-normalization of urinary oxalate levels in a majority of adult patients with PH1 and PH2 following single-dose administration. As of a data cut on October 1, 2018, investigators reported that a single 3.0-mg/kg dose of DCR‑PHXC brought urinary oxalate levels into the normal range (defined as 24-hour excretion <0.460 mmol) at one or more post-dose time points in three out of four PH participants dosed at this level, including a mean maximal reduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate of 65% for the cohort, and a single 1.5-mg/kg dose led to near-normalization (defined as 24-hour excretion ≥0.460 to <0.600 mmol) in three out of four PH1 participants dosed at this level, which led to a mean maximal reduction in urinary oxalate of 50% in the five PH patients dosed at that level, including one PH2 patient. In addition, DCR-PHXC, as of the October 1, 2018 data cut, was safe and well-tolerated in this ongoing study based on data from 12 adult participants with PH1 (n=11) and PH2 (n=1) and 25 adult HVs.
LDHA reduction has a near-linear correlation with oxalate reduction and offers a minimal metabolic intervention. These benefits of LDHA inhibition may translate into consistent therapeutic activity even in the event of a missed dose. There are numerous case reports of LDHA deficiency naturally occurring in humans, with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver.
DCR‑HBVS for HBV
We have declared a GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate, DCR‑HBVS, are conducting formal non-clinical development studies, and have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial. We received CTA approval from the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority in November 2018 and ethics approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee in December 2018 for a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic HBV. The Phase 1 study was initiated in December 2018 and the first participants were dosed on January 24, 2019. We anticipate human POC data to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we filed for regulatory clearance in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand in December 2018.

Current therapies for HBV rarely lead to a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen (“HBsAg”) and sustained HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) suppression in patient plasma or blood. DCR‑HBVS targets HBV messenger RNA and leads to greater than 99% reduction in circulated HBsAg in mouse models of HBV infection. Based on preclinical studies, and only if we receive appropriate regulatory approval to begin human clinical trials, we hope to determine the potential of DCR‑HBVS to reduce HBsAg expression and HBV DNA in HBV patients in a subcutaneous dosing paradigm.
According to the Hepatitis B Foundation, the World Health Organization estimates that globally, HBV is reported to be the most common serious liver infection with over 250 million patients chronically infected. Annual mortality directly linked to chronic HBV infection is estimated to be approximately 780,000 people with an estimated 650,000 of these deaths caused by cirrhosis and liver cancer as a result of chronic hepatitis B, and a further 130,000 of these deaths from complications associated with acute disease. Chronic HBV is characterized by the presence of the HBsAg for six months or more.
Nucleoside analogs and pegylated interferon regimens have been utilized to suppress the virus; however, while the regimens can offer long-term viral suppression if taken continuously, they do not provide a cure. The vast majority of treated patients do not achieve an immunological cure of chronic HBV infection under treatment with these agents. The chance of achieving a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBsAg and sustained HBV DNA suppression may be possible with the introduction of novel drugs designed to reduce intrahepatic and serum HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA.
An undisclosed rare disease involving the liver
We are developing a GalXC-based therapeutic targeting a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. For competitive reasons, we have not yet publicly disclosed the target gene or disease. We have selected this target gene and disease based on criteria that include having a strong therapeutic hypothesis, a readily-identifiable patient population, the availability of a potentially predictive biomarker, high unmet medical need, favorable competitive positioning and what we believe is a rapid projected path to approval. The disease is a genetic disorder where mutations in the disease gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein. The protein causes progressive liver damage and fibrosis, in some cases leading to cirrhosis and liver failure, and we believe that silencing of the disease gene will prevent production of the abnormal protein and thereby slow or stop progression of the liver fibrosis. Greater than 100,000 people in the U.S. are believed to be homozygous for the mutation that causes the liver disease, and at least 10% of those people, and potentially a significantly higher fraction, are believed to have liver-associated disease as a consequence. We intend to submit regulatory filings in the second quarter of 2019.
Additional pipeline programs
We have developed a robust portfolio of additional targets and diseases that we plan to pursue either on our own or in collaboration with partners. We have applied our GalXC technology to multiple gene targets across our disease focus areas of rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Pursuant to our strategy, we have established and continue to seek collaborations with larger, experienced pharmaceutical companies to advance our programs in the areas of chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases, as well as select rare diseases that do not fit our criteria for a priority development program. The chronic liver and cardiovascular disease areas represent large and diverse patient populations, requiring complex clinical development and commercialization paths that we believe can be more effectively pursued in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies. For our additional rare diseases, we are continuing to assess their potential for clinical success and market opportunity while optimizing our GalXC molecules. For our additional pipeline programs, we may utilize more advanced versions of our GalXC technology that further improve pharmaceutical properties of the GalXC molecules, including enhancing the duration of action and potency. We have further optimized our GalXC technology platform, enabling the development of next generation GalXC molecules. Improvements to our GalXC compound include modification of the tetraloop end of the molecule, which can be applied to any target gene, resulting in a substantially longer duration of action and higher potency of target gene silencing in animal models across multiple targets. Modification of the tetraloop only impacts the passenger strand and does not impact the guide strand. These modifications are unique to our GalXC molecules and, we believe, provide a competitive advantage for us.
Other development programs
We also have developed a wholly-owned clinical candidate, DCR-BCAT, targeting the β-catenin oncogene. DCR-BCAT is based on an extended version of our earlier generation non-GalXC RNAi technology and is delivered by our LNP tumor delivery system, EnCoreTM. We plan to out-license the DCR-BCAT opportunity, given our focus on our GalXC platform-based programs.

The table below sets forth the state of development of our various GalXC RNAi platform product candidates as of March 4, 2019:
Status of Dicerna Programs

• | Primary Hyperoxaluria. We are developing DCR‑PHXC for the treatment of all types of PH. Our Phase 1 clinical trial called PHYOX™ has completed dosing. PHYOX is a Phase 1 single ascending-dose study of DCR‑PHXC in healthy volunteers (“HVs”) and study participants with PH. The study is divided into two groups:


• | Group A is a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single center study which enrolled 25 HVs.


• | Group B is an open-label, multi-center study enrolling up to 18 participants with PH type 1 (“PH1”) or PH type 2 (“PH2”). The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single of DCR‑PHXC in both groups. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of single doses of DCR‑PHXC on biochemical markers, and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of single doses of DCR‑PHXC in HVs and study participants with PH.

In May 2018, we dosed the first PH study participant with DCR‑PHXC in the Group B portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial and received notice from the U.S. FDA granting Orphan Drug Designation to DCR‑PHXC for treatment of PH. In August 2018, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) designated DCR‑PHXC as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PH in the European Union (“EU”). Currently, we are in the process of submitting requests for additional regulatory clearances necessary to commence clinical trials for our Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in 2019. Key regulatory interactions with the FDA and EMA in anticipation of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are also underway.
We completed the Group A portion of the study in HVs and started the Group B portion of the study. Group B consists of participants with PH1 dosed at 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0-mg/kg, and participants with PH2 at a dose level of 1.5 and 3.0-mg/kg. As of January 17, 2019, we had dosed all 18 participants (15 PH1 participants and three PH2 participants). We reported interim results from the PHYOX trial on September 5, 2018 and presented updated results as of October 1, 2018 at Kidney Week in San Diego on October 25, 2018.
As of November 2018, three serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have occurred in two participants (one subject experienced two discreet SAEs) in the PHYOX trial; none of these SAEs are related to the study intervention. There have been no clinically significant changes in electrocardiography, vital signs, laboratory, or hematology values. The investigators have observed in a total of 32 participants dosed (Group A and B together) mild-to-moderate injection site reactions in nine participants (28%), all of which were transient and resolved without intervention within 24 to 72 hours.
As of a data cut on October 1, 2018, investigators reported that a single 3.0-mg/kg dose of DCR‑PHXC brought urinary oxalate levels into the normal range (defined as 24-hour excretion <0.460 mmol) at one or more post-dose time points in three out of four PH participants dosed at this level, including a mean maximal reduction in 24-hour urinary oxalate of 65% for the cohort, and a single 1.5-mg/kg dose led to near-normalization (defined as 24-hour excretion ≥0.460 to <0.600 
9

mmol) in three out of four PH1 participants dosed at this level, and led to a mean maximal reduction in urinary oxalate of 50% in the five PH patients dosed at that level, including one PH2 patient.
Additionally, we intend to initiate a multi-dose study, which we hope will serve as a registration trial, in the first quarter of 2019, pending regulatory feedback.

• | Chronic Hepatitis B Virus infection. We have declared a GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate for the treatment of chronic HBV, DCR‑HBVS, and have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial. We received CTA approval from the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority in November 2018 and ethics approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee in December 2018 for a Phase 1 clinical trial in HVs and patients with chronic HBV. The Phase 1 study was initiated in December 2018 and the first participant was dosed on January 24, 2019. We anticipate human POC data to be available in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, we filed for regulatory clearance in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand in December 2018.

Current therapies for HBV rarely lead to a long-term immunological cure as measured by the clearance of HBsAg and sustained HBV DNA suppression in patient plasma or blood. DCR‑HBVS targets HBV mRNA and leads to greater than 99% reduction in circulated HBsAg in mouse models of HBV infection. DCR‑HBVS is comprised of a single GalXC molecule that targets HBV mRNAs within the HBsAg gene sequence region. In preclinical studies with a standard mouse model of HBV infection, we have found that targeting this region leads to superior HBsAg suppression, both in magnitude and duration of suppression, compared to targeting within the X gene sequence region. We believe that this difference in suppression derives from the role of the X gene product in indirectly regulating viral gene transcription such that the lack of X gene product leads to higher levels of viral gene transcription. Based on our preclinical studies, we hope to determine the potential of DCR‑HBVS to reduce HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in the blood of HBV patients in a commercially attractive subcutaneous dosing paradigm.

• | An undisclosed rare disease involving the liver. We are developing a GalXC-based therapeutic, targeting a liver-expressed gene involved in a serious rare disease. For competitive reasons, we have not yet publicly disclosed the target gene or disease. The disease is a genetic disorder where mutations in the disease gene lead to the production of an abnormal protein. The protein causes progressive liver damage and fibrosis, in some cases leading to cirrhosis and liver failure, and we believe that silencing of the disease gene will prevent production of the abnormal protein and thereby slow or stop progression of the liver fibrosis. We intend to submit regulatory filings in the second quarter of 2019.


• | Additional pipeline programs. We have developed a robust portfolio of additional targets and diseases that we plan to pursue either on our own or in collaboration with partners. We have applied our GalXC technology to multiple gene targets across our disease focus areas of rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.

Pursuant to our strategy, we are seeking collaborations with larger and/or more experienced pharmaceutical companies to advance our programs in the areas of chronic liver diseases and cardiovascular diseases, as well as select rare diseases that do not fit our criteria for a priority development program. The chronic liver and cardiovascular disease areas represent large and diverse patient populations, requiring complex clinical development and commercialization paths that we believe can be more effectively pursued in collaboration with larger pharmaceutical companies. Certain rare diseases require complex clinical development and commercialization paths aligned with existing treatment paradigms that we believe can be more effectively pursued in collaboration with companies possessing certain rare disease expertise.
For our additional rare disease opportunities, we are continuing to assess their potential for clinical success and market opportunity while optimizing our GalXC molecules. For our additional pipeline programs, we may utilize more advanced versions of our GalXC technology that further improve pharmaceutical properties of the GalXC molecules, including enhancing the duration of action and potency. We have further optimized our GalXC technology platform, enabling the development of next generation GalXC molecules. Improvements to our GalXC compound include modification of the tetraloop end of the molecule, which can be applied to any target gene, resulting in a substantially longer duration of action and higher potency of target gene silencing in animal models across multiple targets. Modification of the tetraloop only impacts the sense strand and does not impact the antisense strand. These modifications are unique to our GalXC molecules and, we believe, provide a competitive advantage for the Company.
Partner Development Programs
Lilly Collaboration
On October 25, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly (the “Lilly Collaboration Agreement”). The Lilly Collaboration Agreement is for the discovery, development, and commercialization of potential new medicines in the areas of cardiometabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and pain. Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Lilly will seek to use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform to progress new drug targets toward clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we will collaborate with Lilly to extend the GalXC RNAi platform technology to non-liver (i.e., non-hepatocyte) tissues, including neural tissues.
10

The Lilly Collaboration Agreement provides that we will work exclusively with Lilly in the neurodegeneration and pain fields with the exception of mutually agreed upon orphan indications. Additionally, we will work exclusively with Lilly on select targets in the cardiometabolic field. Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we will provide Lilly with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to support the companies’ activities and to enable Lilly to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement contemplates in excess of 10 targets.
Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, Lilly paid us a non-refundable, non-creditable upfront payment of $100.0 million, and made a concurrent stated $100.0 million equity investment in Dicerna at a premium pursuant to a share issuance agreement between the parties (the “Lilly Share Issuance Agreement”). Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we are also eligible to potentially receive up to approximately $350.0 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, in addition to a $5.0 million payment due for each of the non-hepatocyte targets when a product achieves proof of principle in an animal model. In addition, the Lilly Collaboration Agreement also provides that Lilly will pay us mid-single to low-double digit royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. Through December 31, 2018, no revenue has been recognized associated with the Lilly Collaboration Agreement.
Alexion Collaboration
On October 22, 2018, we and Alexion entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement (the “Alexion Collaboration Agreement”) for the joint discovery and development of RNAi therapies for complement-mediated diseases. Under the terms of the Alexion Collaboration Agreement, we will collaborate with Alexion on the discovery and development of subcutaneously delivered GalXC candidates, currently in preclinical development, for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases with potential global commercialization by Alexion. We will lead the joint discovery and research efforts through the preclinical stage, and Alexion will lead development efforts beginning with Phase 1 studies. We will be responsible for manufacturing of the GalXC candidates through the completion of Phase 1, the costs of which will be paid by Alexion. Alexion will be solely responsible for the manufacturing of any product candidate subsequent to the completion of Phase 1. 
The Alexion Collaboration Agreement also provides Alexion with exclusive worldwide licenses as well as development and commercial rights for two of our preclinical, subcutaneously delivered GalXC RNAi candidates and an exclusive option for the discovery and development of GalXC RNAi candidates against two additional complement pathway targets.
Under the terms of the Alexion Collaboration Agreement, Alexion paid us a non-refundable, non-reimbursable, and non-creditable upfront payment of $22.0 million, with Alexion Pharmaceuticals making a concurrent stated $15.0 million equity investment in Dicerna at a premium pursuant to a share issuance agreement between the parties (the “Alexion Share Issuance Agreement”). The Alexion Collaboration Agreement also provides for potential additional payments to us of up to $600.0 million from proceeds from target option exercises and development and sales milestones, as defined in the agreement, which is comprised of option exercise fees of up to $20.0 million, representing $10.0 million for each of the candidates selected; development milestones of up to $105.0 million for each product; and aggregate sales milestones of up to $160.0 million. Under the agreement, Alexion will also pay us mid-single to low-double digit royalties on potential product sales on a country-by-country, product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of market or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. Through December 31, 2018, we recognized $0.1 million in revenue associated with the Alexion Collaboration Agreement.
BI Collaboration
On October 27, 2017, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with BI (the “BI Agreement”), pursuant to which we and BI agreed to jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of chronic liver diseases, with an initial focus on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) using our GalXC platform. NASH is caused by the buildup of fat in the liver, potentially leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH has an especially high prevalence among obese and diabetic patients and is an area of high unmet medical need. The BI Agreement is for the development of product candidates against an initial undisclosed target gene and includes an option for BI to add the development of product candidates that target a second gene (the “Additional Target”). We are working exclusively with BI to develop the product candidates against the undisclosed target gene. We are responsible for the discovery and initial profiling of the product candidates, including primary preclinical studies, synthesis, and delivery. BI is responsible for evaluating and selecting the product candidates for further development. If BI selects one or more product candidates, it will be responsible for further preclinical development, clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization of those products. Pursuant to the BI Agreement, we granted BI a worldwide license in connection with the research and development of the product candidates and have transferred to BI certain intellectual property rights of the product candidates selected by BI for clinical development and commercialization. We also may provide assistance to BI in order to help BI further develop selected product candidates.
11

Under the terms of the BI Agreement, BI agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million for the first target. During the term of the research program, we will be reimbursed by BI up to an agreed-upon limit for the cost of materials and third-party expenses that have been included in the preclinical studies. We are eligible to receive up to $191.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the initial target. We are also eligible to receive royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, tiered from high single digits up to low double-digits. 
In October 2018, BI exercised its option under the BI Agreement to add the development of product candidates targeting an Additional Target to the development activities governed by the BI Agreement. On December 31, 2018, we entered into an Additional Target Agreement (the “ATA”) with BI. The ATA requires the parties to agree on a research work plan and budget for the Additional Target. The ATA also amends the BI Agreement to provide BI with the option to add the development of product candidates targeting a further additional undisclosed gene target for a three-year period, and to provide for the delivery of a replacement product candidate by us to BI in the event that a product candidate under the BI Agreement or the ATA fails at certain stages of preclinical or clinical development.
Under the terms of the ATA, in accordance with the terms of the BI Agreement, and upon agreement of a research work plan and budget, BI agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $5.0 million to exercise its initial option for development related to the Additional Target. Under the terms of the ATA, during the term of the research program, BI will reimburse us for certain expenses. We are eligible to receive up to $170.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the Additional Target. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, in the mid-single digits. Other than as set forth in the ATA, development of the Additional Target will be subject to the terms of the BI Agreement. Under the ATA, if BI elects to exercise the second option, the parties would agree to a research work plan and budget for the additional gene and negotiate development and commercialization milestones and royalty payments to Dicerna. BI would make another option fee payment to us of $5.0 million. Through December 31, 2018, we recognized $7.1 million in revenue associated with the BI Agreement.
License Agreements
In December 2014, we licensed all of our non-U.S. intellectual property rights to a non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary. In December 2015, we licensed our U.S. intellectual property rights to the same non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary. In December 2016, the same non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiary distributed the U.S. intellectual property rights back to us. In 2017, we amended a licensing agreement with the non-U.S. subsidiary to exclude from the scope and operation of that agreement the intellectual property licensed to BI pursuant to the BI Agreement. As such, effective October 27, 2017 certain rights associated with the BI Agreement reverted to us.
Intellectual Property
We are seeking multifaceted and multi-layered protection for our intellectual property that includes licenses, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, subcontractors, and other third parties and generally seek to control access to our documentation and proprietary information.
Patents and proprietary rights
We own U.S. patents and a number of pending patent applications with claims to methods and compositions of matter that cover various aspects of our RNAi technology and our discovery technologies, including our proprietary GalXC technology. These U.S. patents include: U.S. 8,349,809 (issued in January 2013, with a projected expiration date of January 2030); U.S. 8,513,207 (issued in August 2013, with a projected expiration date of May 2030); and U.S. 8,927,705 (issued in January 2015, with a projected expiration date of July 2030). We also own numerous patents and patent applications covering specific RNAi sequences that drive activity against 12 high value disease targets, including targets for our key programs. We have issued or pending claims to RNAi molecules, pharmaceutical compositions/formulations, methods of use, including in vitro and in vivo methods of reducing target gene expression, methods of treatment, methods of inhibiting cell growth, and methods of synthesis.
Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain patent coverage in various jurisdictions around the world with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest non-provisional priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed and the patent in question has not been invalidated by a court with proper jurisdiction. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened. We are obtaining worldwide patent protection for at least novel molecules, composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the “know-
12

how” regarding a novel invention or the trade secrets that may be inherent in a given process or method rather than pursue patent protection. For each patent application that is filed we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular technology.
We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights, other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our collaborators against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors who receive confidential information from us, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights, and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the U.S. and other territories worldwide.
See Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for a more detailed discussion of the risks to our intellectual property.
Competition
To our knowledge, there are no other companies developing GalXC molecules for therapeutic use. We believe that our scientific knowledge and expertise in RNAi-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Our competition can be grouped into three broad categories:

• | Other companies working to develop RNAi therapeutic products;


• | Companies developing technology known as antisense, which, similar to the RNAi therapy we use, attempts to silence specific genes; and


• | Commercialized products and product candidates, as well as development programs that treat the same diseases for which we are also developing treatments.

Our success will be based, in part, upon our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that offer competitive advantages such as improved safety, more convenient dosing, and higher efficacy competing products for the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are superior to the products we may develop. 
Summarized below is information on perceived competition for our most advanced product candidates.
Primary Hyperoxaluria
Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat primary hyperoxaluria. The current standard of care for treating PH1 is a dual-organ transplant, specifically a kidney and liver transplant in patients with PH1, which is often difficult to perform due to lack of donors and the threat of organ rejection. Other treatments include pyridoxine regimens and intensive dialysis, as well as treatments 
13

generally used in kidney stone disorders such as high-volume fluid intake and oral citrate. These other treatments do not halt disease progression. 
We believe that the following product candidates, if approved, could compete with DCR-PHXC:

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Lumasiran(formerly ALN-GO1) | RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase | Phase 3
Oxthera AB | Oxabact | Bacteria intended to interact with the intestinal epithelial cells and promote secretion of oxalate from the body | Phase 3
Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Reloxaliase(formerly ALLN-177) | RNAi enzyme to reduce oxalate levels | Phase 2

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of PH, such as Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.
Hepatitis B Virus
Nucleoside analogs and pegylated interferon regimens have been utilized in order to suppress the hepatitis B virus in patients with chronic HBV infection. However, while these regimens can offer long-term viral suppression, they do not provide a cure, and they usually require lifelong therapy. A finite treatment option with the chance of achieving a long-term immunological cure, as measured by the clearance of HBsAg and sustained HBV DNA suppression, may be possible with the introduction of novel drugs designed to reduce intrahepatic and serum HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA.
We believe that the following product candidates, if approved, could compete with DCR-HBVS:    
Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Partner: Vir Biotechnology | ALN-HBV02 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1/2 
Arbutus Biopharma | ARB-1467 | RNAi lipid nanoparticle formulation | Phase 2 
Arbutus Biopharma | AB-729 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Preclinical
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Partner: Janssen | ARO-HBV | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Partner: GlaxoSmithKline | IONIS-HBVRx | RNA-targeted antisense technology | Phase 2 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Partner: GlaxoSmithKline | IONIS-HBV-LRx | Antisense oligonucleotide-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2 
F. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd | RG6004 | Antisense oligonucleotide-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of HBV.
If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we undertake clinical trials, they may compete with therapies that are either in development or currently marketed by our competitors. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe sufficient unmet medical need exists to warrant the continuing advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Sales and Marketing
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and, where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of funds, our ability to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products, compliance with laws governing our sales and marketing activities, and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties.
14

Manufacturing and Supply
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. For each product candidate, we currently contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for certain drug materials, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. 
Presently, some of the drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities are supplied by a single source supplier and we are in the process of identifying secondary suppliers. We believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist; however, there is a risk that, if supplies are interrupted, it would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control, and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, record-keeping, advertising, distribution, sampling, pricing, sales and marketing, safety, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and the extensive laws and regulations that apply to drug products and product candidates in the U.S. are subject to change.
U.S. government regulation
NDA approval processes
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may result in a delay of approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;


• | withdrawal of an approval;


• | imposition of a clinical hold;


• | issuance of warning or untitled letters;


• | product recalls;


• | product seizures;


• | refusals of government contracts;


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally includes the following:

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable laws and regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated


• | performance and inspection of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials and clinical data according to FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;

15


• | submission of an NDA to the FDA and the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for filing;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the major investigational sites to ensure data integrity and assess compliance with GCP requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or non-clinical testing stage. non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the non-clinical studies, manufacturing, and quality information, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA regulations and GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and the informed consent form before a clinical trial commences at that institution, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to be publicly posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 – The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and elimination. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


• | Phase 2 – Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3 – Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of an NDA. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a 
16

Special Protocol Assessment, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations and GCP.
The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in certain circumstances. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may condition approval on the completion of post approval studies. Such studies may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. If the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug, the FDA may also condition approval on the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”). The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
Expedited review and approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, breakthrough, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. A sponsor can request application of these programs either alone or in combination with each other, depending on the circumstances. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. None of the expedited approval programs change the NDA approval standard applied to a product.
New drugs are eligible for Fast Track status if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track status entitles such a drug to expedited review and frequent contact with the FDA review division. Unlike other expedited review programs, Fast Track designation allows the FDA to accept for review individual sections of the NDA on a rolling basis. The FDA may also grant a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months from filing of an NDA, rather than the standard review of ten months from filing under current Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
17

Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA typically requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval conduct post-approval clinical trials. As an additional condition of approval, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of all promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The FDA may expedite the approval of a designated breakthrough therapy, which is a drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA must take the appropriate steps to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), was signed into law. The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative and breakthrough therapies. The Cures Act amends the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH and to authorize the FDA to increase spending on innovation projects. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. The Cures Act also includes a provision that requires certain manufacturers or distributors of an investigational drug to make their policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs publicly available. Because the Cures Act was enacted relatively recently and the FDA may take several years to develop these policies, it is difficult to know the full extent of how the Cures Act will affect our business.
Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (i.e., an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant) submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right 
18

of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to product candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications including a full NDA to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA prior to us.
On August 8, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) was enacted. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA’s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act, including the FDARA amendment, its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.
Pediatric exclusivity, pediatric use and rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain product candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
FDARA amended the FDCA to provide that a drug, for which an application has been submitted or approved pursuant to section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the FDCA, will not be considered ineligible for approval or misbranded because the labeling of such drug omits a pediatric indication or other pediatric labeling information when the omitted pediatric information is protected by patent or marketing exclusivity. FDARA further permits FDA to require specific labeling for such products related to the omitted pediatric indication and information to, among other things, make clear that the omission of the information is related to the exclusivity. We do not know if or how such changes to the pediatric exclusivity provisions might affect our business.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
19

Section 529 of the FDCA is intended to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Although there are existing incentive programs to encourage the development and study of drugs for rare diseases, pediatric populations, and unmet medical needs, section 529 provides an additional incentive for rare pediatric diseases, which may be used alone or in combination with other incentive programs. “Rare pediatric disease” is defined as a disease that:

• | “primarily affects individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents,” which is interpreted as meaning that greater than 50% of the affected population in the U.S. is aged 0 through 18 years; and


• | is “a rare disease or condition” as defined in the FDCA, which includes diseases and conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and diseases and conditions that affect a larger number of persons and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. can be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.

Under section 529, the sponsor of a human drug application for a rare pediatric disease drug product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used (or sold) to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product. The rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers program was re-authorized by Congress in the Cures Act, extending the program through 2020. The FDA has issued draft Guidance for Industry for Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers.
Post-approval requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 trials (post-approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and efficacy may be imposed as a condition of approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in REMS or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling changes, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;


• | submission of periodic reports;


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;


• | drug sampling, stability and distribution requirements;


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and


• | complying with statutory and regulatory requirements for promotion and advertising.

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved product candidates are required to register their establishments and provide product listing information to the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
Regulation outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries, and approval of the regulators of such countries or supranational areas, such as the European Union (“EU”), before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
20

Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for certain medicines, including those produced by biotechnology or those intended to treat HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Through the decentralized procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EU can be simultaneously authorized in several EU member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each member state must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Sponsors of orphan drugs in the EU can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period, marketing authorization applications for “similar” medicinal products will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. In the EU, a “similar medicinal product” is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered and paid for by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, the current U.S. administration has indicated support for possible new measures to regulate drug pricing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could significantly limit our net revenue and financial results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry by, for example, expanding coverage for the uninsured and seeking to contain overall healthcare costs. Regarding pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products such as expanding and increasing industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and making changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Recently, the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress have expressed a desire to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which has contributed to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the ACA and also underscores the potential for additional health care reform going forward. For example, the newly enacted federal 
21

income tax law includes a provision effective January 1, 2019, repealing the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Congress may consider other legislation that would alter other aspects of the ACA. In addition, at least one U.S. District Court has ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional, and while the ruling was stayed pending appellate review, it is uncertain whether the ruling will be affirmed, and if affirmed, whether all or some of the ACA would then survive. 
There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current U.S. administration, the U.S. Congress, and the courts may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act that made several healthcare reforms. For example, the law changes the discounts manufacturers are required to apply to their drugs under the Coverage Gap Discount Program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price starting in 2019. In addition, the law increases civil and criminal penalties for fraud and abuse laws, including, for example, criminal fines for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute increase from $25,000 to $100,000 and corresponding prison sentences also increase from no more than five years to no more than ten years.
 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, in September 2017, the California State Assembly approved SB17 which requires pharmaceutical companies to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before any scheduled increases in the prices of their products if they exceed 16% over a two-year period, and further requiring pharmaceutical companies to explain the reasons for such increases. Effective in 2016, Vermont passed a law requiring certain manufacturer identified by the state to justify their price increases.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls and/or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Fraud and Laws
In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include 
22

anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) (discussed below).
Additionally, on January 31, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) proposed an amendment to one of the existing Anti-Kickback safe harbors (42 C.F.R. 1001.952(h)) which would prohibit certain pharmaceutical manufacturers from offering rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid managed care programs. The proposed amendment would remove protection for "discounts" from Anti-Kickback enforcement action, and would include criminal and civil penalties for knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward the referral of business reimbursable under federal health care programs. At the same time, HHS also proposed to create a new safe harbor to protect point-of-sale discounts that drug manufacturers provide directly to patients, and adds another safe harbor to protect certain administrative fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs. If this proposal is adopted, in whole or in part, it could affect the pricing and reimbursement for any products for which we receive approval in the future.
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, more general personal privacy laws have also been enacted by various States, such as Massachusetts, by other countries where we do business, such as member countries of the European Union, that require adoption of policies and procedures to protect, properly store, and to obtain permission to use in our business and clinical research. Failure to comply could result in penalties and interruption of our business should a violation occur.
23

We expect our product candidates, once approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, our product candidates may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in certain government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
Environment
Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 78 full-time employees, of whom 49 are engaged in research and development and 29 in administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Geographically, 66 of our employees are located in Massachusetts, nine in Colorado, one in New Jersey, one in New York, and one in North Carolina.
