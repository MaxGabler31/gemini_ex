ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 We are engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs that treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of the hormone cortisol. Elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol are implicated in a broad range of diseases. Since our founding in 1998, we have developed mifepristone, a compound that modulates the effects of cortisol by acting as a competitive antagonist at the glucocorticoid receptor (“GR”). We have discovered three structurally distinct series of proprietary, selective cortisol modulators, all of which share mifepristone’s affinity for GR but, unlike mifepristone, do not bind to the progesterone receptor (“PR”) and so do not cause effects associated with antagonism of progesterone activity. Pre-clinical and clinical development of compounds from these series are in progress.

In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Korlym® (mifepristone) 300 mg tablets as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery.  We first made Korlym available to patients commercially in April 2012.
 We are conducting clinical trials of three compounds from our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, including:  (i) a Phase 2 trial of relacorilant (the recently-approved generic name for CORT125134) to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome; (ii) a Phase 1/2 trial of relacorilant combined with Celgene Corporation’s drug Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) to treat patients with a variety of solid tumors; (iii) a Phase 1/2 trial of CORT125281 combined with Pfizer Inc.’s androgen receptor antagonist Xtandi® (enzalutamide) to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”); and (iv) a Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects to assess the safety and tolerability of CORT118335, which we plan to develop for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatotic hepatitis (“NASH”) and antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
 The Role of Cortisol in Disease
 Cortisol is a steroid hormone that plays a significant role in the way the body reacts to stressful conditions. It influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. In healthy people, cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm that is essential to health, peaking upon awakening and decreasing during the day.  Cortisol is essential for survival. Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity – known as hypercortisolism – may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems. Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol may reduce a patient’s immune response to oncogenesis, shield certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and facilitate the growth of others. 
 The challenge in treating hypercortisolism is that destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. An effective medication must modulate cortisol’s effects without suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting the body’s normal cortisol rhythm. The action of cortisol can effectively be modulated by the use of compounds that compete with cortisol as it attempts to bind to GR. Mifepristone, the active ingredient in Korlym, is a competitive GR antagonist, as are Corcept’s proprietary compounds.
 Because mifepristone works by reducing the binding of excess cortisol to GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol’s necessary, normal functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to PR thereby terminating pregnancy and causing other side effects, including irregular vaginal bleeding (a manageable but debilitating side-effect suffered by a significant portion of women who take Korlym). Our selective cortisol modulators block GR as potently as mifepristone does, but have no affinity for PR and so do not cause PR-related side effects.
 Cushing’s Syndrome
 Background. Cushing’s syndrome is the clinical manifestation of hypercortisolism.  It most often affects adults aged 20 to 50. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients and about 20,000 patients with Cushing’s syndrome in the United States, approximately half of whom are cured by surgery.  
 Symptoms vary, but most people with Cushing’s syndrome have one or more of the following symptoms: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated. The preferred treatment for Cushing’s syndrome patients is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can result in a range of complications and has varying rates of success. In approximately half of the patients, surgery is not successful because the tumor cannot be located or removed completely.

Korlym to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We have received orphan drug designation and marketing exclusivity from the FDA for Korlym for the treatment of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Orphan drugs receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval, as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs, marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the FDA in the drug development process.
 We sell Korlym in the United States, using experienced sales representatives who target the endocrinologists and other specialists caring for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. We also reach patients directly through web-based initiatives and interactions with patient groups. Because many people who suffer from Cushing’s syndrome are undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate physicians and patients about diagnosis of this syndrome and the role cortisol modulators can play in treating the disease. In addition, we have a field-based force of medical science liaisons. 
 We use one specialty pharmacy and one specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support. Our policy is that no patient with Cushing’s syndrome will be denied access to Korlym for financial reasons.  To help us achieve that goal, we fund our own patient support programs and donate money to independent charitable foundations that help patients cover the cost of their Cushing’s syndrome care, whether or not they are taking Korlym.
 Relacorilant (CORT125134) to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome.  We are conducting a Phase 2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, relacorilant, to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome. The trial is open label and will enroll approximately 30 patients at sites in the United States and Europe.  Relacorilant shares Korlym’s affinity for GR. Data from its Phase 1 trial showed that relacorilant prevents the effects of the steroid prednisone, a commonly-used synthetic GR agonist, on serum osteocalcin, white blood cell counts, glucose metabolism and expression of the FKBP5 gene – a marker of GR activation. Modulating the effect of prednisone is a strong surrogate for modulation of cortisol – the essential quality of an effective treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Unlike Korlym, relacorilant has no affinity for PR and so does not cause the effects associated with PR affinity, including endometrial thickening and irregular vaginal bleeding.
 Interim results from the first 17 patients to complete the trial showed statistically significant, dose-dependent improvements in glucose tolerance and serum osteocalcin (a marker of bone growth that is suppressed in Cushing’s syndrome, which causes osteoporosis).  Forty-two percent of the patients with uncontrolled hypertension exhibited a five millimeter or greater reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure.  As expected, patients experienced no progesterone-related side effects.  There were no discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events and no serious adverse events.
 FKBP5 Gene Expression.  We have developed a CLIA-validated assay to measure FKBP5 gene expression that we believe will enable physicians to more easily identify new patients with hypercortisolism and better treat patients already in their care. 
 Oncology
 There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that cortisol’s activity allows certain solid-tumor cancers to resist treatment. In some cancers, cortisol activity promotes tumor growth. In other cancers, cortisol stimulates genes that retard cellular apoptosis.  Cortisol also suppresses the body's immune response, which is often useful, as it lessens the frequency of autoimmune diseases. However, activating, not suppressing, the immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. Adding a cortisol modulator to a treatment regimen may help the patient’s immune system combat the disease.  Many tumor types express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them triple-negative breast, ovarian, castration-resistant prostate, cervical, and pancreatic cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma.
 Relacorilant to Treat Patients with Solid-Tumors.  We are conducting a Phase 1/2 open label trial of Abraxane in combination with relacorilant to treat solid tumors. As we identify indications of clinical activity in a particular tumor-type, we will further test the combination’s efficacy and safety in expansion cohorts of approximately 20 patients.  We began enrolling the first expansion cohort in December 2017, treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.  We continue to explore opening cohorts in patients with other solid-tumors, including metastatic triple-negative breast and ovarian cancer. We may also initiate new trials evaluating relacorilant in combination with other cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, to treat solid tumors.

Korlym to Treat Patients with Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (“TNBC”).  In December 2016, we announced the results of our Phase 1/2 trial of Korlym in combination with eribulin (Eisai Inc.’s drug, Halaven®) to treat patients with metastatic TNBC.  The trial studied 21 patients with GR-positive tumors, one with GR-negative tumors and one with tumors whose GR status was not known. As determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”), efficacy results were as follows: four patients exhibited a partial response, defined as a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size; eight had stable disease; and 11 had progressive disease. Six patients achieved progression-free survival (“PFS”) longer than the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for PFS (15 weeks) in patients receiving Halaven® monotherapy in a comparable population (Aogi et al., Annals of Oncology 23: 1441-1448, 2012). Median PFS in the trial was 11.1 weeks – compared to 7.2 weeks in the Halaven monotherapy study reported by Aogi.
 We believe the addition of Korlym to chemotherapy warrants further study. University of Chicago investigators are leading a 64-patient double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase 2 trial of Korlym combined with Abraxane to treat patients with TNBC. Celgene is funding the trial.  University of Chicago investigators are also conducting a 74-patient, open label trial of Korlym combined with Merck’s drug Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced HER2-negative and triple-negative breast cancer.  Merck is funding the trial.  We are providing Korlym to both trials.
 Cortisol Modulators to Treat Patients with CRPC.  Because androgens stimulate prostate tumor growth, androgen deprivation is a common treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.  Tumors eventually escape androgen deprivation therapy through the proliferation of cells for which cortisol’s stimulation of GR is the primary growth factor.  Combining a cortisol modulator with an androgen modulator such as Xtandi may block this escape route.
 We have begun dosing patients in an open label Phase 1/2 trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator CORT125281 combined with Xtandi in patients with metastatic CRPC at sites in the United States and Europe.  
 University of Chicago investigators are leading an 84-patient, controlled, multicenter Phase 2 trial of Korlym combined with Xtandi to treat patients with metastatic CRPC.  The Department of Defense and the Prostate Cancer Foundation are funding the trial. Pfizer is providing Xtandi. We are providing Korlym.  
 We have exclusively licensed patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of cortisol modulators combined with anticancer agents to treat TNBC and with androgen deprivation agents to treat CRPC.
 Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and NASH
 In animal models, our proprietary selective cortisol modulator CORT118335 potently prevents and reverses the weight gain caused by Eli Lilly and Company’s antipsychotic medication Zyprexa® (olanzapine).  These findings replicate data from placebo-controlled clinical trials we conducted, in which the mifepristone (the active ingredient in Korlym) significantly reduced the weight gain and other adverse metabolic effects in healthy subjects administered Zyprexa® or Johnson & Johnson’s antipsychotic medication Risperdal® (risperidone).  We published the results of these trials in the journals Advances in Therapy, Gross et al (2009) and Obesity, Gross et al (2010).
 CORT118335 also prevents and reverses non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver fibrosis in animal models.  We conducted these pre-clinical studies in response to reports suggesting that cortisol modulation with Korlym may have played a role in reversing fatty liver disease in patients with Cushing’s syndrome.  Fatty liver disease is a precursor to NASH.
 We are conducting a Phase 1 trial of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CORT118335.  We plan to advance it to Phase 2 as a potential treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight gain and NASH.

Development of Our Other Selective Cortisol Modulators
 Our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators, which includes relacorilant, CORT125281 and CORT118335, consists of more than 500 compounds in three structurally distinct families.  All of these compounds potently block GR but not the progesterone, estrogen or androgen receptors. Many of these compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal or in vitro models of cortisol modulation. We plan to continue identifying new compounds and advancing the most promising of them towards the clinic.  
 The United States Patent & Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has issued us nine composition of matter patents covering our selective cortisol modulators and 22 method of use patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat a wide range of serious disorders.  We have exclusively licensed three U.S. method of use patents from Stanford University and five method of use patents from the University of Chicago. We also own an extensive portfolio of patents in countries around the world.  We have applied, and will continue to apply, for U.S. and foreign patents covering the composition and method of use of our product candidates.  See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
 Studies by Independent Investigators
 For many years we have advanced our understanding of cortisol modulation by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the utility of mifepristone or our proprietary selective cortisol modulators in a wide range of disorders, including central serous retinopathy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcoholism, cocaine addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, muscular dystrophy, Cushing’s syndrome, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, and a wide range of solid tumors, including triple-negative breast, prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma.
Clinical Trial Agreements 
 Some of our clinical trials are conducted through the use of clinical research organizations (“CROs”). Our Phase 2 trial of relacorilant for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome is being conducted under an agreement with Chiltern International Limited (“Chiltern”).  Novella Clinical LLC (“Novella”) is helping us conduct our Phase 1/2 trial of CORT125281 to treat patients with CRPC.  Our agreements with Chiltern and Novella may be terminated by us on 60 days’ written notice or sooner if the parties mutually agree.
Research and Development Spending
 We incurred $40.4 million, $23.8 million and $15.4 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which accounted for 38%, 34% and 29%, respectively, of our total operating expenses in those years. 
Manufacturing Korlym
 We do not have manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. In March 2014, we entered into a long-term agreement with one contract manufacturer – Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (“PCAS”), to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for Korlym, pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase from PCAS a minimum percentage of our mifepristone requirements.   The initial term of the agreement is five years, with an automatic extension of one year, unless either party gives 12-months prior written notice of termination. We have the right to terminate the agreement if PCAS is unable to manufacture mifepristone for nine consecutive months. 
 We have one tablet manufacturer for Korlym – Alcami Corporation (“Alcami,” formerly known as AAI Pharma Services Corp., or AAI). In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Alcami for the manufacture and packaging of Korlym tablets. The initial term of this agreement is three years, with consecutive automatic extensions of two years, unless either party gives written termination notice (in the case of Alcami, 18 months prior to the end of the applicable term; in our case, 12 months prior to the end of the applicable term). We have the right to terminate the agreement if (i) Alcami is unable to manufacture our product for four consecutive months or (ii) our product is withdrawn from the market. We have no minimum purchase obligations under this agreement.

Orphan Drug Designation
 We have received Orphan Drug designation for Korlym for the treatment of endogenous Cushing syndrome in the United States.   Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the Orphan Drug Act, including seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the specific drug for the orphan indication, if it receives the first regulatory approval for that indication, with limited exceptions.  A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Orphan Drug designation for one medication does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same Orphan indication. It also does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process for a drug.
 Our marketing exclusivity period for Korlym to treat patients with Cushing’s syndrome ends on February 17, 2019, after which time a competitor that has received FDA approval for a generic equivalent of Korlym may market its drug to patients with Cushing’s syndrome, provided doing so would not infringe any of our applicable patents.  We have two patents listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, that we believe would be infringed by a generic competitor for Korlym.  We have additional applications for patents we believe would qualify for the Orange Book under examination by the USPTO.
 Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”)
 The FDCA establishes an approval process for generic versions of approved drugs (“Innovator Drugs”) through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug with the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to the Innovator Drug. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical and clinical data establishing safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the Innovator Drug. 
 In seeking approval, ANDA applicants must certify to the FDA that any Orange Book patents relating to the Innovator Drug are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic product.  This is known as a “Paragraph IV certification.”  If the owner of the Innovator Drug responds to receipt of a paragraph IV certification by suing the ANDA applicant for patent infringement, the FDA may not approve the ANDA application until the earlier of 30 months or when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the ANDA applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. Owners of Innovator Drugs regularly challenge paragraph IV certifications and trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve.
 In February 2018, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) had submitted an ANDA seeking FDA approval for a generic version of Korlym.  Teva’s Paragraph IV certification stated that our listed Orange Book patents will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed product, are invalid and/or are unenforceable.  We plan to vigorously defend our extensive intellectual property rights in Korlym.
 Competition for Korlym
 Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other medications, including “off-label” uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication. Korlym also competes with Novartis’ drug, Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection, which the FDA approved in December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work. (Cushing’s disease is a subset of Cushing’s syndrome that afflicts approximately 70 percent of patients with Cushing’s syndrome.)
 In the future, Korlym may experience competition from generic versions and from new compounds. For example, Strongbridge Biopharma plc is developing levoketoconazole, a chiral form of ketoconazole. Novartis is 
 6


developing osilodrostat, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor.  Both compounds are in Phase 3 testing in the United States and European Union.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and to rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 Mifepristone. The composition of matter patent covering mifepristone has expired. The only other FDA-approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy. The FDA has imposed significant restrictions on this use of mifepristone. To protect our market for Korlym we rely on (1) the exclusive marketing rights conferred as a benefit of orphan drug designation and marketing exclusivity in the United States, (2) the restrictions imposed by the FDA on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy, (3) the different patient populations, administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat Cushing’s syndrome and (4) our method of use patents described below.
 Oncology. We have exclusive license agreements with the University of Chicago to patents covering the use of all cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (in combination with anti-cancer agents) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (in combination with androgen deprivation agents). See “Business – License Agreements.”
 Other Method of Use Patents. We own U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment, the prevention and treatment of stress disorders, improving the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy, the treatment of delirium, the treatment of catatonia, the treatment of psychosis with Interferon-Alpha therapy, inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with Down’s Syndrome, the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication, the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, the treatment of migraine headaches, the treatment of neurological damage in premature infants, and the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We own a method of use patent for optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum in patients suffering from any disorder, including Cushing’s syndrome, amenable to treatment with mifepristone. We also own a method of use patent covering the use of mifepristone to diagnose and treat ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome.  The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2020 to 2036.
 In addition, we have 22 U.S. method-of-use applications covering our selective cortisol modulators.
 We estimate that the expiration dates of the patents that could issue from these applications and their foreign counterparts range from 2029 to 2037. 
 Composition of Matter Patents Covering Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators. We have nine U.S. composition of matter patents containing claims relating to three structurally distinct series of next-generation cortisol modulators. Four of these patents have issued in Europe, with an additional U.S. application pending. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2026 to 2033.
 We have also filed, where we deemed appropriate, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
 We believe that our patents are valid and that we do not infringe any third-party’s patents or other proprietary rights, and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third-parties other than Stanford University and the University of Chicago.

License Agreements
 We have exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents from Stanford University for the use of cortisol modulators, including mifepristone, in the treatment of psychotic depression, cocaine-induced psychosis and early dementia, including early Alzheimer’s disease. We are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to Stanford University on sales of products commercialized under these patents. Milestone payments are creditable against future royalties. Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2018 and 2019 or upon notification by us to Stanford. 
 We have also exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago three issued U.S. patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and a second patent family consisting of an issued U.S. patent and applications in Europe having claims directed to the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. Our license will end upon expiration of the related patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. 
 Government Regulation
 Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing; submission of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug’s intended use; and approval by the FDA. The process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense.
 Preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an IND, which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans. If it is anticipated that the clinical trial will be conducted in Europe, a Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) must be submitted and approved by the appropriate European regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the study. Typically, human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
  
• | Phase 1. The product candidate is administered to a small number of healthy subjects to provide preliminary information as to its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics and sometimes to provide preliminary information as to its activity and/or efficacy. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered to patients afflicted with the target disease to determine its preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and to provide more evidence of safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to a larger group of patients afflicted with the target disease to establish its risk/benefit ratio and to demonstrate with substantial evidence its efficacy and safety.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA and the institutional review boards associated with clinical trial sites closely monitor the progress of clinical trials conducted in the United States and may reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate a trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to unacceptable risks. The FDA may also require that additional trials be conducted.
 After Phase 3 trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Applications (“NDA”). The FDA reviews an NDA upon submission and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. If the FDA accepts an NDA for filing, it may grant marketing approval (i.e., permit commercial sales), request additional information or deny the application. Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to examine the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User 
 8


Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, and six months for priority review if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant benefit compared to marketed drugs. FDA approvals may not be granted on a timely basis or at all.
 If the FDA approves an NDA, physicians may prescribe the subject drug to patients in the United States. The FDA may withdraw a product’s marketing approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. The drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA, which could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or removal of the product from the market.  In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of such studies.
 Facilities involved in the manufacture of drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities where applicable and must comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”). Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including suspension of manufacturing or a product recall.
 The FDA imposes complex regulations on entities, such as Corcept, that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals.  These include standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA has broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Failure to abide by its regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal penalties.
 In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a drug developer may conduct other preclinical and clinical trials investigating use of the approved compound to treat additional indications. Data supporting the use of a drug for new indications must be approved by the FDA before the drug can be marketed for these indications.
 Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
 We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States. If we do so, we (or our potential future partners) will have to complete an approval process similar to the U.S. approval process before we can distribute our product candidates in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional preclinical and clinical trials. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States. The prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which they will be covered by government health care programs and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Although this trend has not had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues, these third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws 
 We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physicians’ sunshine laws and regulations.  
 9


The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 In addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The PPACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must report such payments to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
