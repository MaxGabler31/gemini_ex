Item 1. Business.
Overview
 ASV Holdings, Inc. (formerly A.S.V., LLC) (referred to herein as “ASV,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” and/or “us”) designs and manufactures a broad range of high-quality compact track loader (“CTL”) and skid steer loader (“SSL”) equipment, marketed through a distribution network in North America, Australia and New Zealand under the ASV brand. We also serve as a private label original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) for several manufacturers.  Our products are used principally in the construction, agricultural and forestry industries. As a full-service manufacturer, we provide pre- and post-sale dealer support, after-sale technical support and replacement parts supplied from our dedicated logistics center. We also supply a limited version of our assembled undercarriage sets to Caterpillar for one configuration of Caterpillar’s multi-terrain CTL machines marketed under the CAT brand under a supply contract with Caterpillar.
Background
 A.S.V., Inc. was founded in 1983 and launched its first CTL machine in 1990.  It launched as a publicly-traded company on Nasdaq in 1994 and operated as a public company until it was acquired by Terex Corporation (“Terex”) on March 3, 2008.  On December 19, 2014, Manitex International, Inc. (“Manitex”) purchased 51% of ASV from Terex pursuant to a joint venture arrangement with Terex (the “Joint Venture”).  On December 23, 2014, A.S.V., Inc. was converted to a Minnesota limited liability company and its name was changed to A.S.V., LLC.  On May 11, 2017, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”), we converted from a Minnesota limited liability company into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from A.S.V., LLC to ASV Holdings, Inc., which we refer to herein as the “LLC Conversion”.
Business Outlook 
 A number of economic indicators that we believe are relevant to our industry and products trended favorably in 2018, although housing starts slowed significantly over the last two quarters raising concerns over the effect of higher interest rates and higher prices. A primary driver of demand for CTL and SSL products is the United States housing market, where the level of new housing starts continues to be below pre-2007 levels. Since 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, new housing starts have incrementally increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 million units in December 2018 from approximately 0.5 million in October 2009.  The preliminary December 2018 rate of 1.1 million was 10.9% below the December 2017 rate.
 Construction spending in the United States experienced growth in 2018. The U.S. Census Bureau reported on March 4, 2019, that total construction spending during December 2018 was estimated at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.3 trillion, 1.6% above the December 2017 estimate. For full year 2018 construction spending was 4.1% above 2017.
 The rental sector is another important market for construction equipment and is recording positive growth that is expected to continue.  The five-year forecast from the ARA Rental Market Monitor, updated in February 2019, predicted equipment rental revenue in North America is expected to grow by 5.0% in 2019 to reach $43.5 billion, 4.5% in 2020, 4.7% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022.  This is a sector of the economy that we are actively targeting with our products. 
 Outside North America, our largest market is Australia.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics in March 2019, reported GDP growth of 2.3% in 2018, which however, reflected a slowing to 0.2% in the December 2018 quarter.   The lower rate of growth in the final quarter was influenced by soft household spending and a decline in dwelling investment.
 The economies of the markets to which we sell our products have for the past few years operated with interest rates at historically low levels. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures which in turn affects sales of our products that serve these activities. Interest rate changes also affect the ability of dealers to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. In the United States, during 2017 and 2018, the Federal Reserve continued increasing interest rates from their historically low levels.  In 2018, the Federal Reserve has increased its benchmark rate four times, in March, June, September and December.  The rate is now at a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.  Increases in interest rates could negatively impact our sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.
 Factors Affecting Revenues and Gross Profit
 We derive most of our revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors and our two largest customers accounted for 28% and 32% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The demand for our products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which we compete, residential housing starts, general construction activity and upon dealer and end-user replacement or repair cycles. Adverse economic conditions may cause dealers or end-users to forego or postpone

new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery. In addition to the United States, we sell to dealers in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. All of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies may have a negative impact on sales volume and sales prices to dealers outside of the United States.
 Factors that affect gross profit include product mix, production levels and cost of raw materials. Margins tend to increase when sales are skewed towards larger, tracked machines and replacement parts. As a consequence, gross profit margins can vary from period to period. Replacement parts generally command higher margins than product sales.

 Backlog
 The Company’s backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $30.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively, and is based upon the value of received orders. 
 Competition
 In all markets, we compete on the basis of product performance, customer service, quality and price. From time to time, the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region. Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit. 
Raw Materials and Component Products
 
The Company’s operating philosophy is to design, source, integrate, quantitatively assess, assemble, ship and integrate product from parts and systems available from third parties and our key suppliers include Kubota, Perkins, Cummins and Deutz. Consequently, we purchase a majority of our components as partially and fully finished assemblies, rather than raw materials for conversion. However, steel is a major component of the chassis, cabs and wheel rims of our product and as such availability and pricing from our suppliers is subject to the global steel market. Extreme movements in the cost and availability of steel and other materials and components may affect our financial performance.  The prices we pay for raw materials used in our products
 may be impacted by tariffs.  On March 8, 2018, the Trump administration signed an order that imposed a tariff of 25% on steel (Section 232 Tariff) that went into effect on March 23, 2018, and in September 2018 a further 10% on many other products imported from China (Section 301 Tariff).  An additional 15% increase to the Section 301 Tariff proposed to be effective March 1, 2019, has currently been indefinitely delayed.  As a result of these tariffs, if we are unable to obtain raw materials, including steel, at historical prices or unable to pass any material prices on to dealers, our margins could be adversely affected and it could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Changes in input costs had a significant effect on our operating performance in 2018, as input prices, and steel components in particular, increased significantly, driven by the above-mentioned tariffs and higher levels of market demand driving increased prices. During the year we have implemented re-engineering and re-sourcing actions to help avoid these increases and have also implemented surcharge price increases to recover steel increases.  The increase in our materials cost of goods sold of $2.4 million adversely impacted our gross profit percentage by approximately 190 basis points in 2018.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets
 
Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products. We generally rely on patent, trade secret and copyright laws as well as confidentiality agreements with other parties to protect our technologies. We believe that we have patent protection relating to certain existing products, specifically with respect to our proprietary Posi-Track undercarriage and suspension. We may also apply for and receive patent protection for our products in the future. We own or have rights to various trademark registrations and trademark registration applications in the United States that we use in connection with our business. The Company has and will continue to dedicate technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain its competitive position.
Environmental Matters
 
We generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations. As a result, we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.
