Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
Hyzon Motors Inc. (“Hyzon”, the “Company”, ‘we, “our” or “us”) was established with a singular goal: to lead the decarbonization of commercial transportation by deploying zero-emission, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”) in a full ecosystem approach, coupling vehicles with access to low-cost, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen and a complete service, parts and maintenance approach. We plan to accomplish this through industry-leading vehicle electrification platforms centered around Hyzon’s fuel cell technology, the production and supply of cost-effective clean hydrogen through diversified partnerships and co-investments, leading partners in service, parts and maintenance, and access to global markets. 
 Transportation is a vital cog in the global economy and constitutes one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions: as a sector, transportation was responsible for approximately 23% of worldwide CO2 emissions in 2019 according to the International Energy Agency. In the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), transportation contributed up to 29% of GHG emissions in 2019, and of that, light, medium and heavy-duty trucks contributed up to 36% of GHG emissions. The urgent need for zero-emission solutions in transportation is clear. 
 Hyzon intends to meet its customers’ zero-emission vehicle needs by electrifying proven vehicle platforms utilizing our industry leading fuel cell and electric propulsion technologies. We expect to deploy these technologies in various vehicle classes, including heavy-duty (“HD”) and medium-duty (“MD”) trucks and buses with the potential for future expansion into light duty commercial vehicles, additional mobility use cases (e.g., aviation, marine, rail) and stationary power applications. Hyzon plans to drive accelerated zero-emission vehicle adoption by focusing on the largest and highest impact value pools of a zero-emission vehicle’s Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”). 
 As illustrated in the diagram, we estimate that typical TCO for a heavy-duty truck consists of upfront vehicle costs (40%), fuel costs (50%) and maintenance costs (10%). Hyzon expects to bring leading zero-emission commercial vehicles to market with increasing vertical integration and innovation across the electric propulsion systems of the vehicle including the fuel cell system. We believe that these specialty vehicle technologies hold the greatest potential for performance and cost improvements given our expectations that they may constitute approximately 70% of the upfront cost of the vehicle. By directly investing in low-cost, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen fuel production, and collaborating with partners in feedstock, production, distribution and dispensing, we expect to bring hydrogen fuel to market to match the demand created by our customers’ fleet deployments. This collaboration will include direct investments by Hyzon via its subsidiary, Hyzon Zero Carbon, Inc., in hydrogen production projects built and operated by Hyzon’s partners, bringing fuel online close to Hyzon vehicle deployments in the near term. Once proven, we expect that these hydrogen supply models will be funded through third party financing via Hyzon Zero Carbon, Inc.

Through these hydrogen fuel production investments and partnerships, combined with highly competitive fuel cell and vehicle electrification technologies, Hyzon seeks to drive decarbonization while reducing vehicle TCO, providing advantaged cost structures and accelerating our customers’ ability to meet diesel parity as the Hyzon-owned content in those value pools increases. 
 Key Benefits of Hydrogen and FCEV HD / MD applications 
 

• | Higher fuel efficiency: FCEVs are known to offer significant improvement in fuel efficiency compared to vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (“ICEs”). Thermal energy efficiency of a hydrogen fuel cell is typically higher than that of an ICE. As an additional benefit, hydrogen fuel cells emit only water while operating.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potentially lower cost of fuel: Due to a combination of factors, including the relative abundance of hydrogen and its ability to be produced from multiple renewable sources (such as waste, wind and solar power, and biomass), we expect that the price of hydrogen will decrease relative to non-renewable hydrocarbon resources, including diesel fuel. Because the cost to transport hydrogen can be significant, close-to-fleet production of hydrogen is expected to result in minimal transportation costs (which are built into the price of hydrogen) as compared to gasoline and diesel fuel which generally must be shipped extended distances. Further, as decarbonization efforts continue globally, including those mandated by many governments, we expect that investments in the hydrocarbon economy will shift towards renewable energy and that investment in hydrogen production will increase worldwide, resulting in advanced hydrogen production technology and lower hydrogen fuel costs. Finally, we expect the price of hydrocarbon fuels to rise due to global conflicts involving various oil producing countries, and as governments around the world increase taxation on high-emissions fuels while incentivizing clean energy sources such as low carbon intensity hydrogen. When coupled with technological innovations that are expected to decrease the cost of producing hydrogen fuel cell systems, we expect these factors to allow hydrogen-powered vehicles to be competitive with diesel and other ICEs, enabling wide adoption by the transportation sector.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved performance: FCEVs use high torque electric propulsion providing optimal performance in commercial mobility. As compared to ICEs, FCEVs provide smoother acceleration, even with vehicle mass exceeding Class 8 vehicle weight limits in the U.S.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced noise: Hydrogen-powered heavy vehicles are generally quieter than comparable ICE vehicles, thus reducing the resulting noise pollution that can affect those operating the vehicles as well as those in the vehicle’s immediate surroundings. In addition, the time restrictions that are placed on truck operations in residential areas are often intended to reduce noise pollution, meaning that quieter hydrogen vehicles may enjoy more freedom to operate in some cases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

  
• | Zero GHG emissions: Hydrogen fuel cell technology is a near-zero-emission powertrain, as there is no combustion occurring in hydrogen fuel cells. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) classifies fuel cell vehicles as “Zero-Emission Vehicles”. Based on CO2 emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency (22.2 pounds of CO2 emissions per gallon of diesel), Hyzon estimates that 100,000 of our hydrogen-powered Class 8 commercial vehicles could eliminate up to 161 million tons of CO2 emissions over 10 years assuming low carbon intensity hydrogen from 100% zero carbon feedstock, 100,000 operating miles annually per vehicle and a comparative consumption rate of 6.25 miles per diesel gallon. We model the total expected CO2 emissions reductions for one hydrogen-powered truck on an annual basis as follows: expected annual miles driven x 1 / (6.25 miles per diesel gallon) x 10 kilograms of CO2 / diesel gallon.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant local area health benefits: In addition to reducing GHG emissions, adoption of hydrogen FCEVs and other hydrogen solutions in the transportation sector can lead to improved air quality due to a reduction in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and emissions of fine particulate matters, including PM2.5 and help meet increasingly stringent air quality standards and regulations around the world.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced TCO: We believe that FCEVs will eventually offer an attractive alternative to commercial operators because of a lower TCO as compared to ICE alternatives. We expect the higher initial purchase prices of FCEVs to be offset by lower overall cost of operations over time. We anticipate that, as global investment in hydrogen technologies and production facilities continues to grow, more favorable hydrogen cost structures will allow hydrogen fuel cell-powered commercial vehicles to deliver lower per mile (or kilometer) operating costs than their ICE equivalents based on publicly available data, including data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seamless transition from ICE is possible: Because of the operating characteristics of FCEVs, existing traditional diesel-powered vehicle fleets can often be seamlessly converted to FCEV fleets without significant changes to how fleet operators conduct their businesses today. Moreover, an operator’s existing refueling practices and operating schedules can generally remain unchanged since hydrogen tanks can be refilled at refueling stations in strategic locations or at dispensing operations established on the fleet operator’s location without long wait times on refueling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In a decarbonized future, we believe that commercial vehicle use cases will be shared between zero-emission electrified commercial vehicle platforms, with FCEVs deployed most densely in applications requiring longer periods of operation between refueling, heavy loads, and/or significant auxiliary power requirements, and battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”) used for other use cases. Examples of use cases that favor FCEVs include heavy duty trucks, medium and light duty trucks with refrigeration, auxiliary power and/or long-range requirements, refuse trucks, and higher mileage energy usage buses and coaches. Based on internal and third-party testing and customer-reported experiences, we also believe that FCEVs offer the following advantages as compared to BEVs: 
 

• | Increased driving range: BEV propulsion systems for large, heavy commercial vehicles with high utilization currently require large, heavy battery packs, which tend to limit driving range and payloads. Our heavy-duty FCEV trucks are expected to include hydrogen storage capacity of 50 kilograms, resulting in a greater than 300-mile range depending on duty cycle. This range is greater than the distance advertised by many manufacturers for their heavy-duty BEVs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6 

  
• | Increased payloads: In the U.S., the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration sets the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (“GVWR”) weight allowance for a Class 8 truck at approximately 36 tons (80,000 lbs.). As depicted in the diagram, a typical heavy commercial tractor is likely to suffer payload limitations when operating as a BEV truck, but these limitations are largely overcome by Hyzon FCEV tractors powered by hydrogen as fuel. This is due to higher energy density of fuel cell and hydrogen systems compared with today’s state-of-the-art batteries. In addition to increased range and reduced refill times offered by hydrogen, this increased payload can generate better economics for our customers. Furthermore, additional weight allowances for zero-emission trucks benefit fuel cell electric trucks to the same extent as BEVs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Faster refueling times: Hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles are refueled in a process similar to natural gas vehicles by pumping compressed hydrogen gas into the vehicle tank using a dispenser and nozzle. Hydrogen benefits from a relatively short refueling time for FCEV trucks, while BEV trucks are expected to take substantially longer to charge, depending on the capacity of the charger.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower infrastructure hurdles: Infrastructure build-out is a challenge for both FCEV and BEV HD and MD commercial vehicles, but we believe hydrogen has the infrastructure advantage when considering the required cost and time to build-out the production, distribution and refueling infrastructure capacities to support each. Hydrogen fuel can be produced locally from a wide variety of resources and, when produced with low carbon intensity production methods and used to power fuel cells, results in zero direct GHG emissions. Clean hydrogen infrastructure can likely be built efficiently by building hydrogen production and dispensing in a modular fashion paired with and close to fleet deployments as the market develops from a breadth of locally available feedstocks, in most cases fully independent from major infrastructure constraints like the electricity grid. Comparatively, our analysis shows that any sizable HD and MD commercial truck BEV fleet deployment in many regions of the world will likely require significant electric charging infrastructure and electricity grid investment to bring substantial rapid charging to bear. For instance, charging just 100 Class 8 BEV trucks, each with battery capacity of 500kWh with megawatt chargers, would likely require at least 50 MW of power to support a back-to-base delivery operation with the shortest possible re-charging time. In addition to investing in last-mile charging infrastructure, significant investment would likely also need to be made in transmission and distribution infrastructure to deliver the power needed to charge high-capacity batteries in HD and MD commercial BEV fleets. In summary, we believe that the combination of availability, energy density, and local production will allow low carbon hydrogen to acquire substantial market share for powering HD and many MD commercial vehicles.

Our Strategy and Strengths 
 Our Strategy 
 We believe that each FCEV sale will lead to multiple sources of revenue over the course of an average vehicle’s 10-year lifecycle: the one-time investment in the vehicle itself, ongoing fuel needs, and regular maintenance, all important elements of a commercial vehicle TCO (as modeled above). Hyzon plans to prioritize those sources with an outsized impact on overall value capture and emissions, maximizing GHG reductions as well as margin potential where possible. Hyzon has established a strategy focusing on generating higher margins by transitioning from purchasing externally-sourced, high value vehicle electrification components (which, together with the fuel cell system, may constitute 70% of the cost of a FCEV Class 8 truck) to internal development and manufacturing, assembly or partnered development and production of such components to complement our industry-leading fuel cell system technology. Hyzon’s strategy is to pursue opportunities to capture value from focused innovation relating to our broadening electric propulsion technologies.

  Vehicles and Vehicle Platforms 
 Hyzon focuses on the development of FCEVs in classes and use cases that benefit most from the advantages of hydrogen and FCEV technology. We work with our customers to identify the optimal vehicle use cases, including vehicles with high energy usage via long range, heavy loads, parasitic energy load losses (e.g., refrigeration, auxiliary power), and/or operational constraints that advantage hydrogen as a fuel. These customers – often early in the adoption phase of FCEVs – will mostly employ a back-to-base model where their vehicles return to a central “base” between operations, thereby allowing them to refuel onsite and/or nearby, as hydrogen can be produced locally at or proximate to the central base. Back to base or regional customer applications include refuse collection, food and beverage distribution, gas and power utilities, port drayage, industrial operations, regional point-to-point freight, coach and transit buses, and many others. As access to hydrogen improves and Hyzon offerings mature, we expect to expand our target customer focus to include longer-haul truck and bus segments, additional vehicle classes, stationary power, incremental mobility applications (e.g., rail, marine, aviation) and additional fuel cell applications. Aligned with our global footprint, Hyzon plans to assemble a variety of vehicle offerings to conform to regional regulations and customer preferences (e.g., cabover vs. traditional, right-hand drive vs. left-hand drive, etc.). 
 Vehicle assembly operations have been globally established to support and match the regional market demands with consideration to planned ramp schedules. Utilizing standard powertrain and electrification module designs, we expect to realize significant manufacturing efficiency and high quality for final assembly. As the developer of zero-emission propulsion technologies, Hyzon will also consider working with fleet operators to re-power vehicles in their fleets to support their clean energy initiatives and carbon footprint minimization. For U.S. production, we plan to utilize a third party vehicle upfitter to support the expected high demand for zero-emission vehicles to allow Hyzon to focus on continued innovation in electric propulsion technologies. 
 Within the vehicle platforms we bring to market, we are focused on developing proprietary vehicle designs, vertical integration or partnered sourcing, and innovation within the critical components responsible for zero-emission vehicle performance via electrification, including fuel cell systems, onboard hydrogen systems, battery technologies, E-axles, electric motors, integrated power electronics, and related equipment. We estimate that these critical components may comprise approximately 70% of the cost base for a zero-emission vehicle. By vertically integrating or partnering our sourcing of the specialty components that drive cost and performance in our electrified vehicle platforms, we believe that we will offer advantaged vehicle cost structures, decarbonized vehicle performance and vital supply chain flexibility. 
 Fuel 
 Our estimates show that fuel represents the majority of the TCO equation for vehicle operators, contributing up to 50% of a typical 10-year TCO for a heavy-duty truck (excluding driver wages). Hyzon’s strategy to optimize this critical component of TCO and zero-emission vehicle adoption in general is to form strategic partnerships across the hydrogen fuel value chain, from feedstock to hydrogen production and dispensing. We have primarily focused on modular, scalable hydrogen production technology partnerships. These partnerships give Hyzon the right to directly invest in projects with leading technology partners. Through these partnerships, Hyzon expects to be able to leverage a full range of low-to-negative carbon intensity feedstocks including solid waste, biomass, renewable natural gas (“RNG”) and renewable power (e.g., wind, solar, hydro). Waste, biomass and renewable gases in particular are an advantaged feedstock for clean hydrogen production given their widespread availability and attractive production costs at relatively small scale. We believe there is ample ability to pair these smaller scale production plants with initial fleet operations, and we expect that modular production will increase as demand grows. We have built a portfolio of hydrogen production technology partners across a range of these low-to-negative carbon intensity feedstocks to provide us with the ability to bring production online in the footprint of the back-to-base fleets that are or plan to be deploying Hyzon FCEV trucks, at the cost and carbon intensity they require. With modular production available close to demand, we can help to reduce the cost of hydrogen to our customers by minimizing distribution costs.

  Hyzon invests in hydrogen fuel production projects and related infrastructure with attractive economics through our subsidiary, Hyzon Zero Carbon, Inc. These projects are primarily managed by our hydrogen production and delivery partners, and they are intended to provide Hyzon with the ability to bring hydrogen production online with our partners at a suitable scale close to fleet demand, with the ability to scale-up production as fleet demand and vehicle deployments grow. Additionally, our direct investment in these projects provides the ability to lock in the cost structure for hydrogen fuel at an equity cost basis. Our direct investments are also intended to minimize distribution costs, given that the production plants will be targeted to be located close to demand and provide the best opportunity to deliver low-cost hydrogen to fleets, thereby driving accelerated parity with diesel. Our focus on low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen feedstocks also maximizes the low carbon fuel subsidy, such as California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program, that may be available to pass on to our customers via our dispensing partners. 
 We have advanced our partnerships across the hydrogen fuel value chain over the past 12 months, particularly in hydrogen production, through Hyzon Zero Carbon, Inc.’s co-investments in certain projects. For example, we have announced partnerships across the hydrogen production feedstock landscape, including those with Raven SR, Transform Materials, TC Energy, ReCarbon, and Woodside. Raven SR’s technology can take many forms of solid waste, biomass or renewable natural gas and produce clean hydrogen through a relatively compact, modular hydrogen production plant or “hydrogen hub” design. These hydrogen hubs can be located at landfills or near natural gas supply locations. Our first hydrogen hub in partnership with Raven SR has been sited at a Republic Services’ landfill in Richmond, California, USA, and is expected to produce 5 tons per day of clean hydrogen from 50 tons per day of solid waste and biomass – enough to fuel 100-120 Class 8 trucks per day. This hub is expected to be online in the second half of 2022. 
 Each of our hydrogen production partnerships has significant potential to produce clean hydrogen across the full set of clean hydrogen feedstocks, with a deep backlog of potential hydrogen production locations across the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. This approach is projected to provide Hyzon’s customers with low-cost fuel that can be brought to market relatively quickly given the smaller scale of these projects and their proximity to demand. It also presents a significant business opportunity for Hyzon given the ability to invest in or fund these projects with attractive potential returns. 
 Our Strengths 
 Our key strengths include the following: 
 

• | Proven hydrogen fuel cell technology and vehicle electrification experience. Based upon both internal and third-party performance testing, we expect our fuel cell technologies and designs to provide superior performance and range compared to electric alternatives, reduced GHG emissions (when green or blue hydrogen serve as a fuel) compared to hydrocarbon alternatives, and eventually meaningful reductions in the total cost of ownership of our vehicles as compared to ICE vehicles due to lower operating and maintenance costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly experienced and proven team. Our senior executive team has deep experience in the design and manufacture of hydrogen fuel cells, heavy-duty vehicle system integration, as well as automotive product development at prominent automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Tier 1 suppliers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong fit with the commercial vehicle market. Hyzon fuel cell system designs target the needs of commercial vehicle operations, and we believe there is significant potential for FCEV adoption in this market. As further described below under the sections entitled “Market Opportunity” and “Competition,” we expect our vehicles to deliver a lower total cost of ownership for fleet operators as compared to ICE vehicles, due to lower operating costs. We believe the rapid technological advances in hydrogen-powered fuel cells, the future abundance of renewable hydrogen, and the increasing investments in hydrogen refueling stations provide an attractive market opportunity for our vehicles. Furthermore, government policies addressing climate change around the world have imposed more stringent emission reduction requirements, and heavy-duty commercial vehicles are becoming a target for emission reduction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



9 

  
• | Vertical integration in key FCEV components and targeted assembly capabilities. We are installing manufacturing and assembly lines for membrane electrode assembly (“MEA”), fuel cell stack, fuel cell system, hydrogen storage system, battery pack, power electronics, for distribution to vehicle assembly locations in the U.S. and elsewhere.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Asset-light, first mover approach to vehicle assembly. Our approach in the near-term is to upfit our fuel cell and electrification components into existing vehicles currently designed to be powered by ICE, supporting our asset-light commercialization model and speed to market. This approach provides the flexibility to source base vehicles from a breadth of established supply sources, including dealer networks. In addition, this approach allows collaboration with our customers to repower their existing fleet assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partnered approach to bringing competitive hydrogen fuel to market located close to fleet deployments. With leading hydrogen production technology partnerships such as with Raven SR, combined with additional partnerships that have and are being formed across the hydrogen fuel value chain (from feedstock to dispensing), we believe that we are positioned to bring competitive, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen to our fleet customers close to their base of operations. We project these models will accelerate the realization of competitive total cost of ownership for Hyzon FCEVs as compared to diesel trucks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity 
 The last ten years have seen the rapid development of clean transport solutions. We believe this growth will continue to accelerate as increased product offerings, technological developments, reduced costs, additional supporting infrastructure, and increased global focus on climate goals drive broader adoption. The demand for hydrogen FCEVs will, in our view, be driven by these factors, together with customers’ needs and desires to decarbonize and meet their environmental, social and governance goals and policies supported by regulations and the decreasing total cost of ownership of FCEVs stemming in part from the improving economics of hydrogen. We believe Hyzon is well positioned to capitalize on this growth across a broad range of mobility applications, including on-road, off-road, rail, maritime and aviation. 
 Focusing on the commercial truck market, the below diagram shows that the market is divided by product segment and use case, depending on the distances travelled (long-haul vs. local or regional), the activities performed (vocational vs. haulage), and the weight classification (heavy / medium / light). Based on the combination of these factors, adjustments can be made to the electric powertrain to optimize vehicle performance. Hyzon focuses initially on those combinations for which our fuel cell technology provides clear benefits – high energy use cases where hydrogen propulsion delivers the best value to our customers. Use cases exist across heavy, medium, and light-duty vehicles, buses and many vocational applications, particularly in back-to-base operations as mentioned previously.

 Note 1: Total U.S. vehicles in operation (“VIO”) for fleets registered to entities with >30 Class 3-8 vehicles; use cases capture top 80+% of VIO within the given product segment; excludes buses, pick-ups, and non-commercial vehicles (e.g., motorhomes). 
 Note 2: Hydrogen advantage is based on management’s expectations and determined by a qualitative scoring against load weight, range, auxiliary power draw, utilization, and industry access to hydrogen. 
 We see potential for our hydrogen vehicle electrification technologies in many other mobility use cases beyond commercial trucks and buses, which we will explore as those markets and opportunities present themselves with a strong fit to our technologies, innovation pipeline, and partnerships. 
 In the aviation sector, hydrogen fuel cells can contribute to the decarbonization of both ground facilities and services, and are currently being evaluated for powering small aircraft. 
 In the rail sector, hydrogen fuel cells are currently capable of powering electric trains and there are trials ongoing in various parts of the world for this application. Hydrogen fuel cells also show promise in decarbonizing the maritime industry which would help to protect the world’s oceans and marine life. Third party studies involving the use of hydrogen and fuel cells as alternative propulsion system for commercial maritime vessels have shown the feasibility of near-zero-emission technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells for re-powering today’s diesel-electric vessels. 
 Fuel cells can also be utilized in situations requiring zero-emission stationary power solutions. Because fuel cells operate independently of the electrical grid, they can be deployed in areas without access to the grid or in emergency settings where the grid has failed. In addition, peak loads exceeding local grid capabilities can be remediated through fuel cell systems, including charging of BEVs in some scenarios. 
 Government entities, states, and municipalities are members of another segment of the market that we believe will actively participate in the transition from ICEs to sustainably powered vehicles and equipment and represent significant potential demand. In the U.S., the CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Truck Regulation in June 2020 mandating truck manufacturers that certify Class 2b-8 chassis or complete vehicles with combustion engines to sell zero-emission trucks as an increasing percentage of their annual California sales from 2024 to 2035. Many U.S. states have expressed their intent to follow similar decarbonization paths. We are in advanced discussions with municipalities and ports in the United Kingdom and European Union. In Australia, grants and incentives are available to support and encourage the adoption and deployment of zero-emission vehicles.

   Our target markets include hydrogen-powered commercial vehicle use cases stemming not only from the need to decarbonize activities, but also from the potential for lower TCO in comparison to the TCO associated with traditional gasoline and diesel ICE vehicles. 
 Given the outlook on the opportunities and market demand for decarbonized hydrogen-powered commercial mobility, we believe that the rapid technological advances in hydrogen-powered fuel cells, coupled with the growing abundance of low-cost renewable fuels that can be converted to hydrogen and the increasing investments in hydrogen refueling stations, FCEVs could dominate many commercial vehicle use cases. Hyzon’s objective is to be a leading player in the emerging hydrogen economy. We will seek to exploit our expanding vehicle electrification technologies as customers take incremental steps towards decarbonizing their operations, including transport and other energy needs. 
 We believe that achieving a decarbonized future requires a vast increase in the production of and access to clean hydrogen - at a cost basis that is at or below diesel fuel costs per mile. The goals for zero-emission vehicle deployments cannot be met without expansion of the fueling infrastructure which includes feedstock sources that can be converted into hydrogen, technologies to produce hydrogen, and distribution and dispensing solutions to bring hydrogen to end-users. By participating in the development of clean hydrogen production and refueling infrastructure, we believe we can accelerate the near-term deployment of FCEVs while positioning ourselves favorably for the long run transition to renewable fuels. Given our strategy of investing in projects with leading hydrogen production partners, utilizing a broad set of clean hydrogen feedstocks, and positioning Hyzon truck fleet deployments close to demand, we expect to have a cost advantage in the hydrogen fuel we expect to produce and provide to fleets. We expect to compete with diesel in many customer use cases from the serviceable area of our first hydrogen hub – expected to be online in Richmond, CA and targeted for the second half of 2022, and at a cost that is expected to be at or below most currently operating forms of clean hydrogen production, given the base technologies’ expected production costs and low transportation costs. This hydrogen strategy provides Hyzon with a substantial market opportunity as our FCEV truck deployments scale in each region of the world where we operate, given the general lack of clean hydrogen infrastructure available today in most regions. 
 TCO as Key Concern for Fleet Operators 
 In highly competitive commercial trucking, fleet operators are focused on their TCO over the lifetime of a vehicle. To control TCO, operators purchase vehicles that offer cost competitiveness and reliability, spend minimal time out of service, can be readily serviced when necessary, and have access to fuel with minimal price volatility. 
 To help our customers achieve these goals, Hyzon offers product, operational, and financing options to facilitate a transition to our vehicles: 
 

• | Upfit of commonly used vehicles – electrifying existing OEM vehicle platforms that our customers operate in their fleets today instead of introducing new cab and chassis designs increases the likelihood that drivers will be comfortable behind the wheel from day one. It further provides entry into international markets, as regional differences in vehicle designs are common, making upfit of existing platforms a faster pathway to putting familiar vehicles into customers’ hands.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trial programs – before purchase, customers may participate in a paid trial to test our vehicles in daily operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel access – during trial and after purchase, Hyzon aims to provide access to fueling infrastructure through a mobile refueler or local hydrogen production plant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Existing carrier and service partners – thanks to a modular vehicle assembly approach, Hyzon can quickly train technical service providers to perform maintenance on the vehicle.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leasing service – customers can participate in Hyzon’s leasing service, paying a stable and predictable monthly bundled rate for vehicle, fuel, and service.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Through these and other core business activities, Hyzon believes that it has developed a pathway to TCO parity with diesel vehicles in multiple geographies. 
 Competition 
 Vehicles and Vehicle Platforms 
 The competitive landscape for our vehicles ranges from vehicles relying on legacy ICEs, to extended range BEVs, to other hydrogen fuel cell and alternative low-to-no carbon emission propulsion vehicles. Competitors include well established vehicle companies already deploying vehicles using fuel cell technology, such as Hyundai and Toyota, and other heavy vehicle companies that have announced their plans to offer fuel cell trucks in the future, such as Daimler and Volvo, along with new entrants in heavy vehicles such as Nikola Corporation and Xos. Additionally, many fuel cell manufacturers, including Ballard, Cummins, PowerCell, ElringKlinger and Plug Power, are considering offering or already offer fuel cell systems for the vehicle markets we are focused on. 
 We also face competition from traditional ICE vehicle manufacturers such as Kenworth, Freightliner, Peterbilt, Isuzu, Navistar, and Volvo. Given stated ambitions of various states and countries to move to zero-emission freight under specified timelines, these competitors pose a threat primarily through their ability to produce at scale, brand recognition, and existing commercial relationships and reputation, should they decide to pursue zero-emission vehicles. 
 Additionally, our FCEVs will compete with BEVs and other low and zero-emission vehicle types in the shift to lower emission freight haulage. As previously discussed, we believe our Hyzon FCEV trucks are well positioned to compete against BEVs and other powertrain types in the vehicle platforms and customer segments in which we choose to compete. The high energy usage, longer range, heavy load use cases we will focus on in heavy, medium, and selective light duty commercial vehicles position FCEVs to out compete BEVs in these areas. Our leading fuel cell technology and go to market approach, inclusive of the hydrogen fuel strategy stated above, provides the basis for which we expect to distinguish our products against our competitors and competing technologies. 
 Fuel 
 In our fuel business, we face or may face competition from a range of traditional energy production, industrial gas and distribution players such as Air Liquide, Air Products, BP, ExxonMobil, renewable power companies such as NextEra, new entrants such as BayoTech, and fuel cell vehicle competitors who are also entering hydrogen production such as Nikola and Plug Power. There are a vast number of hydrogen production projects that have been announced in geographies around the world that will be competing based on their ability to bring hydrogen production online at the lowest delivered cost and lowest carbon intensity possible, and to deliver to hydrogen consumption markets including transportation. Our competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, and marketing of their hydrogen production and dispensing services. Additionally, our competitors may also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships, and other tangible and intangible resources than us in energy and fuel production and delivery. They may already have access to those customers that we hope to target to sell hydrogen as fuel to their vehicles. We have mitigated some of these risks via partnerships with many of the companies in this space, but they may or may not be exclusive in nature, and those partners may still be able to compete directly against us in securing customers for hydrogen fuel. 
 These fuel competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development (“R&D”), sales, marketing, and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.

  Our Technology 
 Our core technology is centered on hydrogen fuel cell stacks and systems that we integrate into commercial vehicles. In addition to our fuel cell technology, we are developing other key vehicle electrification elements that are incorporated in our FCEVs. For example, we are developing fast charge/discharge LFP battery packs and control capabilities that we plan to incorporate into our FCEVs to improve performance, reduce fuel consumption, and mitigate supply chain risks. Further, we plan to manufacture or assemble other key components including E-axles and power electronics. Consistent with our strategy to focus on vehicle platforms and the specialty components, we believe these actions will help us improve the quality of our vehicles, reduce product costs, and increase our gross margins over time. 
Hydrogen Fuel Cells 
 The hydrogen fuel cell system is a central feature of the powertrain in a FCEV. The fuel cell stack is the heart of a fuel cell system. It generates electricity in the form of direct current from electrochemical reactions that take place in the fuel cell. Each single cell produces a small amount of power, and these cells are combined in series within a fuel cell stack. A typical fuel cell stack may consist of hundreds of individual cells. The level of power produced by a fuel cell stack depends upon several factors, such as fuel cell design and operating conditions, including the temperature at which it operates, stoichiometric ratio and pressure of the gases supplied to the cell. 
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Stack 
 An advantage of our technology is the high power density, and the current fuel cell stacks can provide up to 150kW of power from a single fuel cell stack. 
 We are also developing our next generation fuel cell stacks, and we intend to deploy our “Made in USA” 200 kW single-stack fuel cell systems in heavy-duty trucks by the end of 2022. We continue to explore opportunities for 300 kW models. 
 Hydrogen fuel cell stacks including those used in our products are made up of two key components: the membrane electrode assembly (the “MEA”) and the bipolar plate. 
 The Membrane Electrode Assembly 
 The main function of the MEA is to generate electric power in a fuel cell. The MEA, however, is also a major cost contributor to the fuel cell, as it contains precious materials functioning as an electrocatalyst, and requires a highly specialized assembly process. The main components of the MEA are the electrolyte membrane and the electrodes that consist of electrocatalyst layers and gas diffusion layers. There are a limited number of large-scale producers of MEA around the world. 
   
14 

  Our Innovations in MEAs 
 The most critical part of the MEA is the cathode electrode. We are developing advanced cathode catalysts with nano-engineered high surface carbon support and use of innovative functionalized ionomers that can improve performance and durability. We expect that our in-house MEA manufacturing capabilities will enable us to introduce innovative material solutions in our MEA products and to remain highly competitive as the global market for high powered fuel cells evolves. Our in-house MEA and bipolar plate technologies have applications in a variety of electrochemical devices from fuel cells to electrolyzers, and even solid-state batteries. 
 Our MEA is expected to provide significant future cost advantage to Hyzon, and serve as a meaningful barrier to entry for those wishing to enter markets requiring high powered fuel cells. 
 Bipolar Plates 
 The main functions of the bipolar plate are to supply the reactant gases to the respective electrodes in the MEA, remove water by-product from the fuel cell stack, and conduct electrons generated by the fuel cell reaction. Also, the bipolar plate distributes coolant in the fuel cell stack to reject the heat generated by the reaction in the MEA. 
Our Innovations in Bipolar Plates 
 We currently deploy unique, patented hybrid plates in our fuel cell stacks. The hybrid plate consists of a carbon cathode plate and a metallic anode plate. The carbon plate provides the cathode with fine flow-field channels and improves water management in the cathode; it also enables high current density and long lifetime operations. The hybrid approach improves power performance, compactness, and expected lifetime simultaneously, all of which are critical for commercial vehicles. 
 Hyzon continues to advance bipolar plate technology as part of our on-going innovation efforts. Thinner and lighter titanium bipolar plates with proprietary flow-field design and production techniques improve stack power densities significantly and may enable Hyzon to supply fuel cells for specific, demanding use cases where power density is critical. 
 Our materials and engineering advancements enable our fuel cells to achieve high overall power output and high power density, both attributes being especially important for heavy duty vehicles. In addition, we utilize advanced fuel cell system controls to mitigate stress factors for the fuel cell stack, resulting in significant improvement of the fuel cell lifetime in real-world settings. Fuel cell lifetime improvements are critically important in achieving TCO parity. 
 High Performance Fuel Cell System 
 


15 

  The fuel cell stack requires a system around it to support its functions, which is made up of air delivery, fuel delivery, cooling, and electrical elements. These systems perform the care and feeding of the fuel cell. The sum of these support systems is commonly referred to as the balance of plant (“BOP”) which, together with the fuel stack, make up the fuel cell system. The fuel cell system takes hydrogen from the hydrogen storage system and performs all the functions necessary to supply conditioned electricity to the high voltage electrical system of the vehicle. 
Batteries 
 FCEVs use batteries for vehicle start up, peak shaving, and braking energy recovery. Each FCEV is based on an electric vehicle platform and batteries have an impact on FCEV cost and performance, although the batteries in FCEVs are much smaller than those in BEVs. Hyzon is developing high safety and fast charge/discharge battery packs for optimized FCEV performance, with in-house battery management system and battery pack technologies. Such battery technology may find applications in hybrid electric vehicles and high performance commercial BEVs. We have solid state battery development at an early stage, in which we are leveraging 20 years of our senior team’s knowhow in electrochemistry. 
 E-axle
Hyzon is developing E-axles to replace centrally mounted single electric motor with multispeed transmission, to optimize vehicle fuel efficiency. 
 Power Electronics 
 We are developing our next generation power electronics modules which integrate multiple inverters and converters in one package. This design can reduce the use of wiring and save space and reduce vehicle cost while improving reliability. 
Our Solutions, Timelines and Existing Customers 
 Hyzon-Branded Commercial Vehicles 
 Hyzon vehicles are assembled in various locations to serve the unique markets in which we operate. We maintain a production facility through our joint venture in Winschoten, Netherlands. We also contract or plan to contract vehicle assembly with third party partners and suppliers in the U.S. and the People’s Republic of China. The vehicles that we assemble and sell currently are heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks and buses. We are also exploring the production of light duty vehicles and, should we proceed, we will seek to source those chassis from OEMs. 
 We are taking a vehicle system-level approach to assembling these vehicles by focusing on our proprietary fuel cell and electric propulsion systems, optimizing the vehicle controls and interfaces while utilizing existing third-party components such as the chassis, cab, and hydrogen cylinders. 
 Our FCEVs contain a fuel cell system based on our proprietary technology. Management’s models suggest that our heavy duty FCEVs can typically achieve a driving range of 250-500 miles (400-800 km) per fill based on installed hydrogen storage capacity. 
 
16 

  Hyzon System-Level Approach 
 

We currently source traction motors, electric accessories, telematics solutions, and other commercially available elements to build our integrated FCEVs. We leverage existing component and assembly supply chain partners such as chassis, cab and hydrogen cylinders, an approach that is expected to minimize tooling and capital expenditures. We are developing our own solid-state batteries by leveraging our deep electrochemistry knowhow. 
 We integrate these systems with proprietary vehicle control software. Further, with the intelligence that is built into today’s telematics components that we integrate into our FCEVs, we can overlay over-the-air communications, a feature that is not possible with traditional diesel/mechanical systems. This allows us to implement remote monitoring, health prognostics, and preventative maintenance to deliver increased uptime to our customers. 
 We are currently accepting orders for heavy-duty and medium-duty trucks, as well as city and coach buses. Our commercial vehicles can be tailored to customer specifications and are expected to include onboard hydrogen storage systems with volumes that provide increased driving range as compared to comparable BEVs, and which are capable of being rapidly refueled. 
 Our FCEVs use compressed hydrogen storage tanks. The pressure of the compressed tank is typically 350-bar, as compared to most light duty vehicles that use a 700-bar system. The advantage of a 350-bar system over a 700-bar system is not only a lower cost of the tank system but also reduced hydrogen fuel cost. Hyzon believes that the 350-bar system can offer better TCO for commercial customers in many heavy-duty vehicle applications. 
 Electrified trucks are expected to require traction motors up to 500kW peak power for heavy-duty and up to 200kW for medium-duty trucks. They also require air compressors for braking and suspension, and electric steering pumps. We expect the electric motors to be able to connect to gearboxes, making it possible for vehicle operators to use power take off (“PTO”) for any super structures such as refuse collection, sewer cleaning, utility service trucks, and many additional applications. The high voltage batteries in these vehicles can be used as a backup power source when the vehicles are stationary to power all accessories for extended periods of time. The specifications that follow are provided for illustrative purposes. We expect to produce other configurations to meet customer requirements. 
 
17 

  Heavy-Duty Trucks 
 Based on our targeted specifications, we expect that our standard heavy-duty trucks will have a Gross Vehicle Mass (“GVM”) of up to 50 metric tonnes and will include an onboard hydrogen mass of 50 kilograms gaseous hydrogen at 350 bar pressure and the option to upgrade to a hydrogen mass of 70 kilograms. The cabin of our heavy-duty trucks is expected to be air suspended and to open using electric tilt. Our heavy-duty trucks are expected to have a Hyzon fuel cell system with power up to 200 kW which combines with an onboard battery for optimal performance. The fuel economy is expected to be up to eleven kilometers per kilogram of hydrogen while loaded. Conventional vehicle chassis are planned to feature as our main offering North America and one of our offerings in Australia, while we expect cabover chassis models to be dominant in European and Asian markets. 
 

We have also announced development efforts with Chart Industries to bring to market a liquid-onboard hydrogen or “LH2 truck”, with the goal of achieving a range of up to 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometers. This vehicle program is expected to be based upon the same cab and chassis being deployed in the heavy-duty category, except with liquid hydrogen tanks on board instead of gaseous hydrogen cylinders. As liquid hydrogen is much more dense than gaseous, the additional fuel capacity significantly increases the range of the vehicle, which is expected to be used in the most challenging on-road and off-road energy usage and range applications, and we expect it will unlock long-haul freight use cases along with ultra-heavy load environments assuming the joint development is successfully brought to market. 
 Additionally in the heavy-duty category, we are actively developing FCEV refuse trucks for deployment globally, with initial efforts underway in Australia and Europe, and plans to offer the FCEV refuse truck platform in North America. Refuse trucks are a highly attractive use case for hydrogen FCEV operations as they have the high energy usage duty cycle as well as the opportunity to place a hydrogen production plant at landfill or depot locations. 
 


18 

  Medium-Duty Trucks 
 Based on target specifications, we expect our medium-duty trucks to be appealing to multiple vocations. Additionally for the U.S. market, we plan to introduce vehicles which are optimized for various vocations utilizing FCEV applications, including field service / utility trucks, extended range box freight delivery trucks and refrigerated trucks, all of which require significant energy in range, payload and / or parasitic or auxiliary power. 
 

Existing Customers 
 As of March 23, 2022, we had received firm orders in an aggregate value of approximately $63.0 million for Hyzon-branded trucks and buses to be supplied to Australia, China, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Our existing customers which have placed orders include leaders in the transportation and logistics and mining sectors, as well as companies committed to reducing the overall environmental impact and fuel costs of their owned and operated trucking fleets. 
 We have also signed non-binding memoranda of understanding and letters of intent with various companies and government agencies – predominantly in Europe, Asia and Australia, that have indicated significant interest in Hyzon-branded commercial vehicles. We have also deployed demonstration or evaluation vehicles to customers. Such non-binding memoranda of understanding and letters of intent signal significant potential fleet demand, but we have not yet converted these non-binding memoranda of understanding or letters of intent into orders or sales. We have no assurances that such potential customers will convert into orders or sales, including because of the current or future financial position and the level of demand for the products and services of such potential customers. We may also be unable to identify or secure additional customers. For more information about these risks, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors”. 
 Additional Hydrogen Fuel Cell Mobility Products and Markets 
 In addition to developing our heavy and medium duty Hyzon-branded commercial vehicles, we are also actively assessing and selectively expanding our ability to integrate and configure hydrogen fuel cell systems into additional commercial vehicle categories as well as rail, maritime and aircraft applications for customers based on their individual requirements. Examples of the additional mobility categories in various stages of Hyzon product assessment and deployment follow: 
Coach and City Buses 
 We are developing coach and city buses with safety features including forward collision warning, advanced emergency braking systems and lane departure warnings. We also expect that our city bus will include remote vehicle monitoring. As with our other commercial vehicle offerings, detailed specifications can be tailored to a customer’s individual requirements. 
 In the regional coach market, many coach bus operators seek at least a 200-mile (320-km) driving range, and, currently, we believe that only hydrogen fuel cells can achieve that range with near-zero-emissions.

19 

  In both applications, we believe that our buses will offer superior performance and operating characteristics compared to diesel buses and provide improved passenger amenity through near-zero-emissions, elimination of diesel odors and quieter operations. 
 We expect to perform coach assembly in the U.S. and Europe to complement existing assembly efforts in Asia (through multiple third-party OEMs) and are currently evaluating possible timelines with respect to beginning assembly activities in those regions. 
 Coaches 
 

Based on typical specifications, we expect that our coach buses will seat up to 57 passengers and have a Curb Weight of 18 metric tonnes. Our coach buses are expected to feature a 120 kW fuel cell coupled with a Dana TM4 power electric motor (115 kW continuous and 230 kW peak power) that provides smooth acceleration and superior control, as well as a 100 kWh battery that provides power when the vehicle is idle, or the fuel supply is exhausted. Designed for long-range passenger transport with comfort in mind, passengers and drivers can enjoy a smooth drive without the disturbance of engine vibration. Fuel cell coaches are typically at least 60% quieter than comparable diesel vehicles, especially at idle. Our coach buses are expected to have a normal driving range of up to 300 kilometers from the onboard hydrogen supply of 26 kilograms. 
City Buses 
 Our fuel cell systems are well suited for both city bus and regional coach applications. For city buses, our fuel cells are designed to be compatible with the 40- and 60-foot (12 and 18-meter) low-floor city bus models that are used in urban areas around the globe. Due to the fast refueling offered by hydrogen-powered buses, we expect cities and municipalities to be able to replace diesel bus fleets with a near-zero-emissions equivalent with minimal impact on operating routes and depot facilities. 
 Light Duty Trucks 
 We have also identified several potential use cases in the light duty commercial truck range, from Class 3 up to Class 5 in North America. These use cases under evaluation include field service / utility trucks with a combination of longer range and parasitic and auxiliary load, refrigerated delivery vans and longer-range box trucks. Many of these trucks expend 30-40% of their total energy while sitting still due to idling and auxiliary power requirements, which challenge BEVs’ abilities to deliver the energy required over a full workday due to battery capacities, weight of batteries, and extended recharging times. We have interest from several customers in the U.S., including gas and power utilities with which we are evaluating potential light duty utility truck programs. 
 
20 

  Fuel Cell Systems for Rail, Maritime and Aviation Applications 
 We also believe that our fuel cell systems could meet customer requirements for rail, maritime, and aviation applications. Indeed, we are already in the process of designing high power density fuel cell systems for small electric aircraft usage. In the first quarter of 2022, we shipped a fuel cell stack to a private aircraft manufacturer of hydrogen electric powered aircraft for evaluation. 
 We have also had discussions with manufacturers of intercity, standard, and high-speed passenger trains to design and integrate our hydrogen fuel cells into passenger trains. In addition, some ocean-going vessel manufacturers have expressed interest in validating our technology for their vessels. To date these applications have not resulted in orders. 
 Hydrogen Fuel Cell System Production and Supply 
 Fuel cell stack production requires a highly specialized process and is well served to be co-located with MEA production to “feed” the fuel cell stack production stage. Production of our fuel cell stacks will initially be centralized in our Bolingbrook, Illinois facility. Fuel cell system assembly is a simpler, low CAPEX process; therefore, the fuel cell system assembly line can be readily placed at vehicle assembly facilities in different parts of the world if the local supply chains for peripherals meet our needs. For the US, the fuel cell system assembly will be placed next to the fuel cell stack production in our Bolingbrook facility, then the assembled fuel cell system will be shipped to vehicle assembly locations. We aim for our first fuel cell stack production and fuel cell system assembly to occur in the second half of 2022. MEA production is expected to begin in our Bolingbrook facility in the first half of 2022. 
 We temporarily source hydrogen fuel cells and fuel cell stacks and systems from an affiliate of Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies PTE Ltd, a Singapore company which beneficially owns a majority of our common stock (“Horizon”), and anticipate continuing to rely on Horizon as a fuel cell supplier until our manufacturing operations are fully operational. We may continue to source hydrogen fuel cells and fuel cell stacks from Horizon for the Chinese market or elsewhere, even after we commence manufacturing our fuel cells, as it may be more economical to source from Horizon’s factory in China than to ship our U.S.-made fuel cells to China or elsewhere pending supply chain constraints. Additionally, we may source hydrogen fuel cells and fuel cell stacks from other suppliers where their access to local markets and subsidies enables us to grow our FCEV market share in that local market by leveraging their sourced technology in Hyzon FCEVs. We also plan to engage in the production of other electrification components for fuel cell vehicles by 2025 at locations to be decided through careful evaluation closer to the commencement of such operations. 
 Complete Hydrogen Solutions 
 Although a significant portion of our current customers are fleet operators that use a back-to-base model with pre-existing access to hydrogen, we are developing a complete hydrogen solution that is intended to serve customers who do not currently have access to hydrogen. This solution is expected to include hydrogen production, compression, and storage. 
 To develop this complete hydrogen solution, we intend to collaborate with chosen technology and project development partners - such as our existing hydrogen production partners mentioned previously - to ensure that affordable hydrogen is available to our fleet customers. In addition, we are entering into new partnerships and collaborations across the hydrogen value chain, from feedstock to dispensing, to enable competitive, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen supply as close to fleet demand as possible in each geography where we operate. For example, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Viva Energy Group Limited to provide near-zero-emission vehicles coupled with hydrogen refueling stations to customers in Australia, and have executed a memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) with TotalEnergies in Europe to collaborate on refueling infrastructure. We believe that we have the potential to realize recurring revenue from certain hydrogen supply partnership agreements as hydrogen production hubs are commissioned. 
 
21 

  These partnerships across the hydrogen fuel production and dispensing value chain paired with Hyzon’s vehicle fleet deployments creates a significant opportunity for Hyzon to invest in fuel production with its partners and benefit from the expected leading cost structures described previously. Those investments are to be made by Hyzon’s subsidiary, Hyzon Zero Carbon, Inc., which will house Hyzon’s interests in the hydrogen fuel side of the business. Bringing fuel to market at an equity investment cost basis, with leading partners developing the fuel value chain with Hyzon, enables us to provide full-service vehicle leases including fuel and vehicles with fuel at a combined TCO that fleet operators can tangibly see in one offering. This provides a simple solution to fleet operators who want a ‘one-stop’ partner in providing the vehicle, fuel and service in their fleet decarbonization journey. 
 In addition, Hyzon has developed an alliance – the Hyzon Zero Carbon Alliance – that aims to facilitate the establishment of hydrogen hubs around the world starting from back-to-base or base-to-base logistics hubs. Hydrogen can be produced from local renewable sources such as municipal waste, renewable natural gas, bio-methanol, solar or wind, not only to refuel the vehicles but also to provide peak load power to the electricity grid, thereby increasing grid resilience. 
 The Hyzon Zero Carbon Alliance aims to facilitate ecosystems for commercializing FCEVs, and collaborators may include energy companies, green hydrogen production companies, hydrogen equipment companies, financing companies, insurance companies, corporate customers and after-sales service companies. The alliance will also promote public awareness and education of the environmental benefits hydrogen mobility and how hydrogen can play an important role in helping to reduce global carbon emissions. We and our alliance partners plan to progress tangible hydrogen ecosystem projects in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Europe during the course of 2022 and beyond. 
 Financing Solutions 
 We provide various vehicle leasing solutions. We are working to establish a financing program in various markets with financing partners, which is expected to enable fleet operators to pay one monthly fee and receive: 

• | the zero-emission vehicle;
--+---------------------------


• | scheduled preventative maintenance; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | hydrogen supply.
--+-----------------


The application of new technology and the development and delivery of competitive hydrogen vehicles has the potential to enable rapid growth for Hyzon around the world and to contribute to the acceptance of commercial hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the affordable transition of the transportation sector to hydrogen energy.

 On August 4, 2020, Hyzon entered into an agreement with Fontaine Modification Company (“Fontaine”) in the U.S. for the purposes of collaboration relating to the assembly of Hyzon branded near-zero-emission trucks to be supplied into the U.S. market. The agreement is initially non-binding in nature but provides a framework for a close future collaboration with the goal of deploying approximately 5,000 Hyzon trucks per year from Fontaine facilities by 2025. 
 On October 30, 2020, Hyzon entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Global NRG H2 Limited, a New Zealand corporation (“NRG”), whereby Hyzon would acquire 17,000 shares of NRG in two tranches totaling $2,448,000, and an Options Agreement of the same date granting Hyzon the right to acquire up to 233,000 shares in three tranches at specified exercise prices. These arrangements were and are intended to afford Hyzon access NRG hydrogen production technology. 
 On October 30, 2020, Hyzon formed Hyzon Motors Europe B.V., a Dutch-based, private limited company joint venture (“Hyzon Europe”) with Holthausen Clean Technology Investments B.V. (“Holthausen”), for the primary purpose of supplying hydrogen-powered trucks to the European Union and nearby markets such as the United Kingdom, the Nordic countries and Switzerland. Hyzon owns 50.5% and Holthausen owns 49.5% of the equity interests of Hyzon Europe, respectively. Pursuant to the 2020 Joint Venture Agreement, by and among Hyzon, Holthausen and Hyzon Europe, neither Hyzon nor Holthausen may have an interest in, be engaged in, or be concerned with, or approach any person with a view to obtaining an interest or being engaged in or concerned with, any business involving the development or production of, or the trading in, any products developed, produced or traded by, or the provision of services developed or provided by Hyzon Europe or any of its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions for de minimis passive investments. On December 31, 2021, Hyzon signed a Non-Binding Letter of Intent with our joint venture partners in Hyzon Europe to purchase from such partners additional shares in Hyzon Europe that, if a transaction effecting this Non-Binding Letter of Intent is completed, will increase Hyzon’s equity stake in Hyzon Europe to 75%. Concurrent with the signing of this LOI, a €1 million refundable deposit was paid to Holthausen, approximately $1.1 million in USD. 
 On April 23, 2021, Hyzon announced its joint venture with Raven SR, a renewable fuels company, to work towards building up to 100 hydrogen hubs across the U.S. and globally, with the first two hubs to be built in California. In connection with this partnership, Hyzon agreed to acquire and subsequently did acquire a minority interest, and options to purchase additional common shares in Raven SR, investing $2.5 million in July 2021. 
 On April 29, 2021, Hyzon, together with Modern Industrial Investment Holding Group (“Modern Group”), announced the signing of a MoU with NEOM Company for the development of a vehicle assembly facility in NEOM, the $500 billion giga-project in northwest Saudi Arabia. Under the MoU, Hyzon, Modern Group and NEOM Company plan to work closely over the next 18 months to finalize plans and specifications for a new NEOM regional assembly facility with an anticipated annual capacity to assemble up to 10,000 vehicles. To facilitate construction of the new facility, Hyzon and Modern Group plan to incorporate a joint venture company, Hyzon Motors Middle East, which would focus on supplying locally-built, Hyzon-branded zero-emission commercial vehicles throughout Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. 
 On May 24, 2021, Hyzon announced that it had signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Sojitz Machinery Corporation of America (“SMA”) with the goal of partnering in penetrating new markets and exploring the development of new fuel cell-powered commercial mobility applications. The strategic relationship between Hyzon and SMA is designed to connect Hyzon’s hydrogen fuel cell-powered heavy vehicles and fuel cell technologies with SMA customers and suppliers. 
 
23 

  On July 6, 2021, Hyzon and Chart Industries Inc. announced their agreement to develop and produce a liquid hydrogen-powered heavy-duty commercial vehicle with a range of up to 1,000 miles. 
 On July 12, 2021, Hyzon announced that it signed an MoU with TotalEnergies SE to expand the companies’ relationship. Under the terms of the MOU, the parties will seek to collaborate on developing hydrogen ecosystems, as well as production and sale of 80 hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks for TotalEnergies’ French customers. 
 On November 9, 2021, Hyzon announced its MoU with ITOCHU, the leading Japanese business group. Under the non-binding MoU, the companies are expected to jointly develop hydrogen supply chain strategies as well as model customer projects for the deployment of Hyzon FCEVs and fuel cell technology in the mining sector. 
 On November 10, 2021, Hyzon announced an agreement with TC Energy to collaborate on development, construction, operation, and ownership of hydrogen production facilities or ‘hubs’ across North America. The hydrogen production facilities will be used to meet hydrogen FCEV demand by focusing on low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen from renewable natural gas, biogas, and other sustainable sources. The facilities will be located close to demand, supporting Hyzon back-to-base vehicle deployments. 
 On December 7, 2021, Hyzon announced an agreement with Woodside Energy to collaborate on developing supply of zero carbon intensity hydrogen and building demand from heavy-duty and medium-duty commercial vehicle customers in the U.S. and Australia. Under the agreement, the companies will evaluate opportunities to develop green hydrogen hubs. Initially, the project will focus on liquid hydrogen supply projects to support Hyzon’s future liquid hydrogen onboard mobility use cases – including ultra-long range trucks already under development, and aviation, marine and rail applications. 
 On January 19, 2022, Hyzon announced a non-binding MoU with Transform Materials, a provider of renewable hydrogen through its innovative proprietary microwave reactor technology. Together, Hyzon and Transform Materials will evaluate proposals to develop facilities to produce low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen from various forms of methane, prioritizing biogas and renewable natural gas. Through Transform Material’s proprietary technology, these facilities (acting as hubs) can be built to produce hydrogen efficiently—even at small scales of 1-5 tons/day—offering modular construction that allows capacity to grow as customer demand increases. Transform’s technology to be employed in these projects produces hydrogen as a co-product with acetylene, providing significantly advantaged hydrogen cost structures. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We have a global sales and marketing strategy that is centrally coordinated and delivered at the regional level, with business development teams in the U.S., Australia, Singapore, China, and Europe. We expect to work with local partners in certain countries to develop agency and/or reseller arrangements. We plan to focus most of our efforts on direct sales to private sector and government heavy-vehicle fleet owners and operators but may also pursue indirect sales through commercial vehicle dealerships and other channels. Our primary methods for growing brand awareness are digital media, traditional media, and industry events.

(”JS Powertrain”) (collectively, “JS Horizon”) and Hyzon, JS Horizon assigned to Hyzon a joint ownership interest in certain intellectual property rights previously developed by JS Horizon (“Background IP”), and each of Hyzon and JS Horizon granted to the other, within such other party’s field of use, exclusive licenses under their respective joint ownership rights in the Background IP, as well as their rights in improvements made in the future with respect to such Background IP. 
 Hyzon’s field of use under the Horizon IP Agreement includes the manufacture, commercialization and other exploitation of mobility products throughout the world, as well as fuel cells designed for use in mobility products commercialized outside of identified countries in Asia, Africa, and South America. JS Horizon’s field of use under the Horizon IP Agreement includes the manufacture, commercialization, and other exploitation throughout the world of fuel cells not designed for use in mobility products, as well as fuel cells designed for use in mobility products commercialized within identified countries in Asia, Africa, and South America. Under the Horizon IP Agreement, the parties also acknowledge and confirm Hyzon’s sole ownership of the 20 pending U.S. provisional patent applications owned by Hyzon as of the date of the Horizon IP Agreement, and Hyzon grants JS Horizon a non-exclusive license under those patent applications (and any patents issuing therefrom), as well as improvements thereto, for use only within JS Horizon’s field of use. Under the terms of the Horizon IP Agreement, the Company was to pay JS Horizon a fee of $10 million as consideration for the rights it receives under the Background IP and improvements. As of December 31, 2021, $6.9 million of the fee was paid and the remaining $3.1 million was paid in February 2022. 
 Prior to entering into the Horizon IP Agreement, Hyzon was a party to a License Agreement, effective as of January 20, 2020 (substantially concurrent with Legacy Hyzon’s formation), pursuant to which Legacy Hyzon received an exclusive license under certain of the Background IP. That agreement was replaced with a Partial Assignment Agreement of Fuel Cell Technology, dated November 19, 2020, which contemplated a joint ownership structure with respect to certain of the Background IP similar to the structure set forth under the Horizon IP Agreement. Both the January 20, 2020 and November 19, 2020 agreements have been superseded by the Horizon IP Agreement. 
 
25 

  As of the date hereof, we exclusively owned 15 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and jointly owned, subject to the terms of the Horizon IP Agreement, 9 issued U.S. patents and 14 pending U.S. non-provisional patent application. 
 We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S, and as of the date hereof, owned 7 trademark applications pending and 1 issued trademark before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
 We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications as we consider appropriate under the circumstances relating to the new technologies that we develop. 
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing IP portfolio will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with our IP strategy and portfolio. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 200 people (full-time equivalents). We anticipate significant employee growth in the near term as we prepare for series production of our hydrogen fuel cells and FCEVs. We have also contracted with various independent contractors and other service providers both in the U.S. and other countries where we operate to perform certain functions or services we require to operate. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate our global workforce are enablers of our success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development and Retention; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits. 
Health and Safety 
 Hyzon is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and our policy, and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on our facility. Hyzon also promotes a culture of health and well-being and provides comprehensive health care benefits. 
Development and Retention 
 Developing employees contributes to growing our business. In today’s world, we compete for talent against other companies in the automotive and renewable energy industries. To recruit and retain top talent, we provide an environment that values an individual’s contributions and assists our employees to achieve their long-term professional goals. We invest significant resources to retain and develop our workforce. We also partner with outside vendors to provide development programs and learning opportunities for all employees, in addition to regular coaching and support from their managers. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps Hyzon remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. While focusing on attracting and advancing top talent, Hyzon is committed to advance global diversity in our workforce, continue advancing pay equity and increase Hyzon’s diversity with underrepresented groups. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the Company, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is currently made up of 2 women out of 9 members and is more than 60% racially or ethnically diverse (6 out of 9 members). In addition, we organize regular cultural events, teambuilding activities and public recognition forums to celebrate our diversity and invest in strong relationships. 
 
26 

  Compensation and Benefits 
 We provide a flexible working environment, which allows our employees to work where and when they can best achieve their goals. Flexibility supports attraction and retention of talent around the globe. Our total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Eligible full-time employees in the U.S. are offered benefits such as vacation days, 401(k), performance bonuses, and a premier health plan for employees and their dependents. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies. 
Government Regulations 
 The industry in which we operate is subject to extensive environmental regulations in numerous countries, and to regulations which have become increasingly more complex and restrictive over time. These laws and regulations generally govern water use, air emissions, use of recycled materials, energy sources, the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, protection of the environment, occupational safety, natural resources and endangered species, and the remediation of environmental contamination. We may be required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. 
 Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial, and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations. Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses that we hold. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Litigation and Regulation” for additional information. 
 GHG Credits 
 In connection with the delivery and placement into service of Hyzon’s near-zero-emission vehicles under the GHG Emissions Standards for Heavy and Medium-Duty Engines and Vehicles (the “EPA Clean Trucks Plan”),we are expected to earn tradable credits that under current laws and regulations can be sold. Under the EPA Clean Trucks Plan, (the EPA is scheduled to make its first rule making in 2022), each hydrogen FCEV earns a credit multiplier of 5.5 for use in the calculation of emission credits. This multiplier is currently set to expire in 2027 but may be extended in future rulemaking. A second set of EPA rules will, if it takes effect, sets more stringent GHG emission standards for new heavy-duty vehicles sold as soon as model year 2030 and beyond. Commercial vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure they meet the carbon-dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission standard for each type of vehicle produced. This emission standard continues to tighten the emission requirements over time, increasing the challenge for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the standard. At present, manufacturers of diesel trucks may need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The EPA Clean Trucks Plan provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Current regulations do not limit the number of battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories. California also has a GHG emissions transportation standard which closely follows the EPA Clean Trucks Plan. However, the California timeline for reaching very low GHG emissions is more aggressive than that of the EPA. 
 
27 

  The CARB Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”) and regulations, including the requirements and benefits of such program, may provide for potential voucher incentives for Hyzon’s Class 8 trucks and their powertrain design and technology, along with additional classes of Hyzon vehicles over time. The HVIP requires eligible vehicles to be “CARB-certified”. CARB’s recently adopted certification standards and test procedures for heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles (the “ZEPCert Procedures,” incorporated in 13 CCR 1956.8(a)(8)) are optional beginning with model year (“MY”) MY2021 and mandatory beginning with MY2024. Thus, prior to MY2024, if Hyzon elects to certify its vehicles following the traditional certification framework (primarily involving GHG certification using the EPA/CARB simulation model), customers that purchase our vehicles in California may be eligible for voucher incentives under the HVIP program (currently set at $120,000 for each Class 8 truck sold and registered in CA). However, the HVIP program provides a credit multiplier that makes Class 8 FCEVs eligible for $240,000 voucher for customers, but this multiplier may be determined in part by how our vehicles are designed and whether they contain on-board, plug-in battery capabilities. 
 Other Financial Incentives 
 Examples of other potential incentive and grant programs that either Hyzon or its customers may apply for include: 
 Programs in the US


• | Low Carbon Fuel Standard. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard was initially developed in California and is gaining traction in other U.S. states and other jurisdictions around the world. Its goal is to reduce the well-to-wheel carbon intensity of fuels by providing both mandated reduction targets as well as tradeable/sellable credits. In California, this includes a credit for hydrogen refueling infrastructure as well as credits for the dispensing of hydrogen as transportation fuel.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grant and Subsidy Programs. Government entities at all levels from federal (including the Department of Energy), state (e.g., CARB) and local (e.g., North Texas Council of Governments), have grant programs designed to increase and accelerate the development and deployment of zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure technologies. Federal and state grant and subsidy programs are under evaluation for introduction and/or expansion, such as LCFS structures in Oregon and Washington, and the Federal IIJA which includes significant funding opportunities for hydrogen ecosystem enablement, including $8 billion for the establishment of at least four hydrogen hubs across the U.S.

Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation 
 Our vehicles and those of our customers whose vehicles we configure or power with our hydrogen fuel cells are subject to, and comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). As a vehicle manufacturer and integrator of hydrogen fuel cells, we must self-certify that the vehicles meet or are exempt from all applicable FMVSS before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the U.S. There are numerous FMVSS that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include: 

• | Electronic Stability Control. Performance and equipment requirements on heavy-duty vehicles to reduce crashes caused by rollover or by directional loss-of-control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Air Brake Systems. Performance and equipment requirements of air brake systems on heavy-duty vehicles to ensure safe braking performance under normal and emergency conditions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electric Vehicle Safety. Limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention, and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flammability of Interior Materials. Burn resistance requirements for materials used in the occupant compartment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seat Belt Assemblies and Anchorages. Performance and equipment requirements to provide effective occupant protection by restraint and reducing the probability of failure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following FMVSS do not apply to our vehicles, but we currently incorporate the applicable components of the standards for additional safety performance: 
 

• | Tire Pressure Monitoring System. Performance requirements to warn the driver of significant under-inflation of tires resulting in safety problems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Roof Crush Resistance. Strength requirements for the occupant roof to prevent crushing of the roof into the occupant compartment in rollover crashes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles. Performance requirements for sound to alert pedestrians that a commercial vehicle is in the immediate area.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Crash Tests for High-Voltage and Hydrogen Fuel System Integrity. Preventing electric shock from high-voltage systems and fires that result from fuel spillage during and after motor vehicle crashes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition to the applicable FMVSS requirements, we also design our vehicles to meet the requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), which has requirements for the truck and fleet owners. We also design our vehicles to meet the requirements set forth in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (“FMCSR”) pertaining to the safety of the driver during operation of the vehicle. There are numerous FMCSR that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include, but are not limited to: 
 

• | Step, Handhold and Deck Requirements. Performance and equipment requirements to enhance the safety for entry, egress, and back of cab access of a heavy-duty vehicle.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Auxiliary Lamps. Performance and placement requirements for lamps in addition to lamps that meet the requirements of FMVSS 108 Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Speedometer. Performance and accuracy requirement for equipment indicating the vehicle speed. This includes both digital and analog displays.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



29 

  We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements and federal laws administered by NHTSA, including early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements. 
 The vehicles we expect to offer for sale in Europe are subject to United Nations Economic Commission Europe (“UNECE”) safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval or “WVTA”, are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Our vehicles currently meet specific NHTSA-type approvals, and we plan to commence testing our vehicles for the WVTA to ensure compliance with the UNECE requirements. There are UNECE compliance requirements and UN Global Technical Regulations (“GTR”) applicable to heavy-duty vehicles in Europe, which have not been developed for heavy-duty vehicles by NHTSA or FMCSA. We have implemented the UNECE standards for additional safety during driving operation. The following are some UNECE standards and GTRs applied to our vehicles: 
 

• | Electromagnetic Compatibility and Interference. Performance requirements for the prevention and interference of electromagnetic radiation which may cause disturbances in the drivability of the vehicles and other vehicles in the area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lane Departure Warning System. Performance and testing requirements for a system that warns the driver of an unintentional drift of the vehicle out of its travel lane.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electric Vehicle Safety. Performance and testing requirements for BEVs and FCEVs during in-use and post-crash.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Safety. Performance and testing requirements for hydrogen FCEVs during in-use and post-crash.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our vehicles and systems consist of many electronic and automated components and systems. Our vehicles are designed to comply with the International Standards Organization’s (“ISO”) Functional Safety Standard. This standard addresses the integration of electrical systems and software and identifies the possible hazards caused by malfunctioning behavior of the safety-related electrical or electronic systems, including the interaction of these systems. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 We currently are subject to extensive environmental national, state and local laws and regulations, including, among others, water use, and discharge, air emissions, use of chemicals and recycled materials, energy sources, storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, the protection of health, safety and the environment, natural resources, and the remediation of environmental contamination. Furthermore, joint ventures and other businesses we may invest in that focus on hydrogen production and distribution hubs and refueling centers are subject to similar environmental and public safety-related laws and regulations. We are required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of environmental permits, many of which may be difficult and expensive to obtain and must be renewed on a periodic basis. A failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, the suspension or loss of such permits, and orders to cease or limit non-compliant operations. 
 Air Emissions 
 Our operations and products are required to comply with regulations under the U.S. Federal Clean Air Act and analogous laws in other jurisdictions. For example, our vehicles are required to obtain a Certificate of Conformity (“COC”) issued by the EPA, or an order issued by the CARB for vehicles sold in jurisdictions that impose California’s emission standards, prior to being sold. There are currently four states which have adopted the CARB standard for heavy-duty vehicles. These COCs must be obtained for each model year of production, and failure to obtain them prior to entering our vehicles into commerce may result in substantial fines or penalties. 
 
30 

   Hazardous Substances and Waste 
 We are subject to laws and regulations regarding the generation, use, treatment, handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes. Hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore, the assembly and transportation of our fuel cells are subject to certain design, manufacturing, packaging, and similar regulations from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Similarly, hydrogen is a “chemical of interest” (“COI”) under the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (“CFATS”). Facilities that store COIs above certain specified thresholds may be required to comply with various reporting, security, and other regulations as part of the CFATS. 
 Additionally, laws may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of sites where hazardous substances have been released or disposed. For instance, in the U.S., the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as ‘Superfund’, as well as similar state laws can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on entities that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of addressing health impacts. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environmental and to recover from the responsible entities the costs they incur. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. 
 We may also generate or dispose of solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of our manufacturing waste may be excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all established requirements for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, we may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or our ability to qualify the materials we use for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our operating expenses. 
 Supply Chain 
 Increasingly, jurisdictions require companies to monitor for and address certain practices from their supply chains. For example, several jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting supply chain diligence laws such as including, but not limited to, Modern Slavery, Conflict Minerals, and Managing Risks to Women in Supply Chains. Compliance with such laws entails substantial costs, and may require modifying our supply chains if any issues are discovered or could result in substantial fines. Additionally, should we fail to sufficiently monitor our supply chains, we may be subject to fines or penalties for non-compliance, which may have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Similar or more stringent laws also exist in other jurisdictions where we operate, including the European Union and Australia.
