Item 1. Business
The Company
 
Solitario Zinc Corp (“Solitario,” “Company,” “we,” “us”) is an exploration stage company at December 31, 2017 under Industry Guide 7, as issued by the SEC. Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation ("Crown"). In July 1994, Solitario became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) through its initial public offering. We have been actively involved in mineral exploration since 1993. Our primary business is to acquire exploration mineral properties or royalties on mineral properties, and/or to discover economic deposits on our mineral properties and advance these deposits, either on our own or through joint ventures, up to the development stage (development activities include, among other things, completion of a feasibility study for the identification of proven and probable reserves, as well as permitting and preparing a deposit for mining). Upon the completion of the Acquisition (defined below), we have shifted our primary focus toward the acquisition and exploration of zinc-related exploration mineral properties. However, we will continue to evaluate other mineral properties for acquisition and hold a portfolio of mineral exploration properties and assets for future sale, joint venture or to create a royalty prior to the definition of proven and probable reserves. We may attempt to sell a given mineral property, pursue its development either on our own or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations, or obtain a royalty from a third party that continues to advance the property. In addition to focusing on our current assets and the evaluation of mineral properties for the acquisition of royalty interests, we also evaluate potential strategic corporate transactions that could result in Solitario obtaining an interest in precious and base metal properties with exploration potential or other business combinations we determine to be favorable to Solitario.
Recent Developments
 
Acquisition of Zazu
 On July 12, 2017 Solitario completed the acquisition of Zazu Metals Corp. (“Zazu”) pursuant to a definitive arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Zazu (the “Zazu Shares”) by way of a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) under the Canada business Corporation Act (the “Acquisition”). As a result of the Acquisition, Zazu became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solitario. At closing, we issued 19,788,177 shares of common stock for all of the issued and outstanding Zazu Shares. We also granted options to acquire an aggregate of 1,782,428 shares of Solitario common stock (the “Replacement Options”) in connection with the Acquisition. The total purchase price for the Acquisition was $16,110,000 and has been allocated to the assets acquired and stock issuance costs, less liabilities. Results of operations for Zazu have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of Acquisition.
 
Name Change to Solitario Zinc Corp.
 Our shareholders voted at our annual meeting of shareholders held on June 29, 2017 in favor of an amendment to Solitario’s Articles of Incorporation to change our name to “Solitario Zinc Corp.” from “Solitario Exploration & Royalty Corp.” The name change was subject to the completion of the Acquisition and became effective on July 17, 2017.

Mineral Exploration Properties
 
As a result of the Acquisition, at December 31, 2017 we hold a 50% operating interest in the Lik zinc-lead-silver deposit in Northwest Alaska, which is considered a large tonnage, high-grade and mineable by open-pit methods. Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”) is a 50% partner with Solitario in the Lik deposit, with Solitario acting as the project manager. Zazu completed a Canadian National Instrument 43-101 compliant Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) on the Lik deposit in 2014.
 
Solitario’s other core asset is a 39% interest in the advanced, high-grade, Florida Canyon zinc project located in northern Peru. The project has a significant mineral resource and Solitario is fully carried to production by its joint venture partner Nexa Resources, SA (“Nexa”) a Brazilian company, formerly Votorantim Metais Holdings, SA (“Votorantim”). Solitario and Nexa completed a PEA on the Florida Canyon deposit in August 2017. Nexa is one of the largest zinc producers in Peru. Since inception of the Florida Canyon joint venture in 2006, Nexa, as Votorantim and its subsidiary, Minera Milpo, have funded 100% of project expenditures. Nexa will earn a 70% interest in the project by continuing to solely fund all project expenditures and committing to place the project into production based upon a positive feasibility study. After earning 70%, and at the request of Solitario, Nexa has further agreed to finance Solitario's 30% participating interest for construction. Solitario will repay the loan facility through 50% of its net cash flow distributions.
 
Solitario also holds an 85% interest in the Chambara exploration project in Peru (Nexa holds the remaining 15%), and a 9.9% equity interest in Vendetta Mining Corp. (“Vendetta”).
 
At December 31, 2017, we also had the 100% owned La Promesa exploration property and our Yanacocha royalty property in Peru, a retained royalty on the Pedra Branca project in Brazil, a retained royalty on non-producing exploration properties in Mexico, and a royalty on certain non-producing mineral claims in Montana. We are conducting exploration and property evaluation activities in Peru either on our own using contract geologists, or through joint ventures operated by our partners.
 
Our exploration activities and those of our joint venture partners are carried out on a property-by-property basis. These activities may include prospecting, geologic mapping, sampling, geophysics and drilling. When we determine that this work indicates a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential, we may impair or completely write-off the property. A significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of zinc or other commodities is down, we may determine that the value of our mineral exploration properties decreases; however, during such down markets it may also become easier and less expensive to locate and acquire new mineral exploration properties.
 

We have recorded revenue in the past from the sale of mineral properties, joint venture property payments and the sale of a royalty on our formerly-held Mt. Hamilton property. Proceeds from the sale or joint venture of properties, although potentially significant when they occur, have not been a consistent source of cash and may only occur in the future, if at all, on an infrequent basis. Accordingly, while we conduct exploration activities on our projects, we need to maintain and replenish our capital resources. We have met our need for capital in the past through (i) proceeds of the sale of our former Mt. Hamilton project in 2015 for net proceeds of $24 million (the “Mt. Hamilton Transaction”); (ii) sale of our shares of common stock of Vendetta and Kinross Gold Corporation (“Kinross”); (iii) borrowing in the form of short-term margin debt secured by our investment in Kinross; (iv) borrowing under long-term debt secured by our Mt. Hamilton project (v) joint venture delay rental payments, including payments on our Florida Canyon project; (vi) a royalty sale for $10,000,000 in 2012; (vii) issuances of common stock; (viii) sale of covered call options on our Kinross common stock; and (ix) interest on short term Treasury Notes and Bank CDs. In the past, we have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities through the use of joint ventures.

--------------------+--

 

We operate in one segment: mineral exploration. We currently conduct exploration activities in Peru and Alaska and evaluate properties for potential acquisition and evaluation of strategic corporate opportunities throughout North and South America. As of March, 12, 2018, we had five full-time employees located in the United States and no full-time employees outside of the United States. We utilize contract managers, geologists, administrators and laborers to execute our Latin American project work and acquisition evaluations.
 
A large number of companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties, many of which have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we have and, accordingly, we may be at a disadvantage in being able to compete effectively for the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. We are not aware of any single competitor or group of competitors that dominate the exploration and development of mineral properties. In acquiring mineral properties for exploration and development, we rely on the experience, technical expertise and knowledge of our employees and advisors, which is limited by the size of our company compared to many of our competitors who may have either more employees or employees with more specialized knowledge and experience.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Mineral development and exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.  Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We are required to obtain the licenses, permits and other authorizations in order to conduct our exploration programs.
Environmental Regulations
 
Our current and planned activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We are required to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we conduct our exploration activities could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. During 2017, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 
Included in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, are total assets of $73,000 and $60,000, respectively, related to Solitario's operations located outside of the United States.
