Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new drugs to improve the lives of cancer patients by addressing key mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the rate and durability of response of many cancer therapies. Our targeted, small molecule drug candidates, designed using our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform, inhibit the activation of kinases, an important family of enzymes, that when mutated or over expressed, are known to be directly involved in the growth and spread of many cancers. We have built a diverse pipeline of wholly owned, orally administered drug candidates that includes three clinical-stage and two research-stage programs. 
 We are studying our lead drug candidate, ripretinib (DCC-2618) in two ongoing Phase 3 studies in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, and in an ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with multiple advanced malignancies, including GIST. Our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, is in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, for whom there are currently no approved therapies. INVICTUS was fully enrolled as of November 2018 and is expected to report initial top-line results in mid-2019. Our second Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, was initiated in December 2018. In addition, we have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST, as well as in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, or ASM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, germ cell cancer, penile cancer and soft tissue sarcomas, as well as a cohort for GIST and other solid tumors with renal impairment. We expect to report data from one or more of these expansion cohorts in 2019. 
 At the European Society of Medical Oncology 2018 Congress, or ESMO 2018, in October 2018, we reported updated preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 1 trial of ripretinib in patients with GIST with a data cutoff date of August 31, 2018. These data included median progression free survival, or mPFS, objective response rates by best response, or ORR, and disease control rates at three months, or DCR, in each case as determined by investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, version 1.1 across 178 patients receiving ripretinib at doses of >100mg daily. In 67 second- and third-line GIST patients we observed a preliminary mPFS of 40 weeks, an ORR of 21% and a DCR of 81%. In 111 fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, we observed a preliminary mPFS of 24 weeks, an ORR of 9% and a DCR of 66%. 
 In addition to ripretinib, we are developing two other clinical-stage drug candidates using our platform, DCC-3014 and rebastinib. These two drug candidates target the macrophage tumor microenvironment. 
 DCC-3014 is an investigational, orally administered, potent and highly selective inhibitor of CSF1R, a kinase that controls the survival and function of certain immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages, or TAMs. Mutations in CSF1R also are associated with certain hematological malignancies including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. In January 2019 we announced positive, preliminary, top-line data from the ongoing dose escalation part of our Phase 1 trial with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies. In addition, we announced a plan to expand the Phase 1 trial to evaluate DCC-3014 in patients diagnosed with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumors, or TGCT. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to study DCC-3014 in combination with other immuno-oncology, or I/O, therapies. We plan to present additional data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial at a medical meeting in 2019. 
 Rebastinib (DCC-2036) is an investigational, orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of TIE2 kinase, which plays an important role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and 
 
5 


  immunotolerance. In October 2018, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In January 2019, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We expect to report initial data from one of the Phase 1b/2 studies in 2019. 
 We believe our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform, supported by our experienced management team, enables us to develop advanced, differentiated, kinase inhibitors that may provide significant benefits to cancer patients. We currently expect to announce a new clinical candidate and commence IND-enabling studies during 2019. 
 Kinase inhibitors have become an important class of cancer therapies. Since the first FDA approval of a kinase inhibitor in 2001, over 40 kinase inhibitors have been approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer, and kinase inhibitor drugs represented approximately $20 billion in 2016 worldwide pharmaceutical sales. Despite the success of this drug class, there remains a significant opportunity for advanced kinase inhibitors that address the shortcomings of current therapies, including limited durability of response caused by development of resistance mutations and off-target toxicities that limit dose and, consequently, target inhibition. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. There remains a substantial opportunity to develop novel inhibitors that target therapeutically relevant kinases. 
 Our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform combines our deep insight into the biology of kinases with our library of drug-like compounds that we specifically designed to interact with a specific region of the kinase called the switch pocket. The transformation of a kinase from a switched-off, or inactivated, state to a switched-on, or activated, state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with another region called the switch pocket. The interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket is a common mechanism among all kinases; however, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases allowing for the rational design of molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or specific kinases. 
 Our drug candidates directly target the conformation-controlling switch that kinases rely on for activation and inhibit the kinase from switching on. We believe that no kinase inhibitors on the market or active in clinical development directly target the switch pocket region. By using our proprietary approach to target the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that are more broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type, or non-mutant, and mutant forms, or that are spectrum-selective against several chosen kinases, all while minimizing off-target toxicity. We believe that our drug candidates will contribute to higher and more durable rates of response compared to other kinase inhibitors even upon accumulation of mutations that would render the kinase resistant to other kinase inhibitors. Our drug candidates bind directly into the switch pocket at the site where the activation switch binds. As a result, we believe that any mutations that occur in the switch pocket region that would diminish the activity of our drug candidates likely also would produce a weakly activated or inactive kinase. 
 We believe the results from the Phase 1 trial of our lead drug candidate ripretinib provide strong evidence of the power of our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform. Patients enrolled in this trial have advanced malignancies and the majority have been treated previously with a series of three or more kinase inhibitors. While the kinase inhibitors these patients have been treated with target some clinically relevant initiating, or primary, mutations in KIT and PDGFRα and drug resistance-causing, or secondary, mutations in KIT, they fail to inhibit all primary and secondary mutations in these kinases involved in GIST. As a result, almost all patients treated with these kinase inhibitors eventually suffer from disease progression. We designed our lead drug candidate ripretinib to inhibit the full spectrum of the known mutant or amplified KIT and PDGFRα kinases that drive cancers such as GIST. 
 We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer therapeutics, including in senior roles at leading pharmaceutical companies. We are 
 
6 


  supported by our board of directors and scientific advisory board, who contribute their deep understanding of drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies and business development. We believe that our team is ideally positioned to leverage our highly differentiated platform to develop and commercialize advanced kinase inhibitors that will have significant benefit for cancer patients. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to develop and commercialize innovative drugs that address the serious unmet medical needs of cancer patients caused by drug resistance or immunotolerance. The principal components of our strategy include: 

 | Rapidly develop and commercialize our lead drug candidate, ripretinib, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST. We are currently advancing ripretinib through clinical development in multiple cancer types. We are initially targeting fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, a market opportunity where there are no approved therapies and a high unmet medical need. In November 2018, we completed enrollment in INVICTUS, our pivotal Phase 3 study in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST, with top-line results expected in mid-2019. We believe that this approach offers a faster, lower risk path to commercialization than initially seeking approval for ripretinib in second-line GIST, where there is already an approved therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand the market opportunity for ripretinib by pursuing development in second-line GIST, ASM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα. In December 2018, we initiated INTRIGUE, a randomized, controlled, pivotal Phase 3 study in second-line GIST comparing treatment with ripretinib to sunitinib, the currently approved standard of care in second-line GIST. Based upon the activity observed in the expansion cohorts of our Phase 1 trial of ripretinib, we may conduct additional pivotal studies in other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα. We believe that this approach offers an opportunity to significantly expand the commercial potential of ripretinib over time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Develop our macrophage immunokinase inhibitors, DCC-3014 and rebastinib, as both single-agent and combination therapies. We believe kinase inhibitors have potential application both as single-agent therapies and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies due to their anticipated synergistic effect with chemotherapies as well as other immuno-oncology therapies, such as anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies. DCC-3014 is currently in a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies. Rebastinib is in two Phase 1b/2 combination studies, one with paclitaxel and one with carboplatin, in patients with various solid tumors. Based on data combining DCC-3014 or rebastinib with anti-PD1 antibodies or anti-tubulin chemotherapy in preclinical studies, we are evaluating opportunities for further development of these drug candidates in combination with other immuno-oncology, or I/O, therapies or chemotherapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand the application of our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to advance additional drug candidates into clinical development. We believe there is a significant opportunity to utilize our kinase switch control inhibitor platform to discover and develop novel kinase inhibitor drug candidates that are directed to other tumor-targeted kinases, immunokinases and kinases critical to other mechanisms that contribute to the growth and spread of cancer. We believe that our platform allows us to identify drug candidates that address mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the clinical utility of many kinase inhibitors. We also believe that our drug candidates should exhibit greater resilience to resistance mutations, offer improved kinase selectivity, or both, compared to existing kinase inhibitors. We are also advancing the preclinical development of additional programs and expect to initiate advanced preclinical studies in one of these programs in 2019.

 | Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines and maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates. We currently have worldwide rights to all of our drug candidates. We intend to selectively evaluate strategic partnerships for our drug candidates with partners whose development and commercial capabilities complement our own. With respect to our macrophage-

targeted immunokinase inhibitor drug candidates, where use in combination with other I/O therapies will be an important driver of commercial value, we believe that strategic partnerships are an effective means of developing and commercializing this class of drug candidates.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establish capabilities to effectively commercialize our drug candidates in the United States. We intend to retain commercial rights to our drug candidates in the United States. We intend to build a targeted, specialty sales force in the United States to support the commercialization of ripretinib and our other drug candidates, if approved.

 Kinases and their Role in Cancer 
 Kinases play an important role in regulating cellular functions and the communication of cells with their environments. When dysregulated, kinases contribute to the development and progression of diseases including cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Since the first FDA approval of the kinase inhibitor imatinib in 2001, kinase inhibitors have become an important class of therapeutics with over 40 kinase inhibitors approved in the United States. Kinase inhibitors represented approximately $20 billion in 2016 worldwide pharmaceutical sales. Despite the success of kinase inhibitors as a drug class, the therapeutic potential of individual kinase inhibitors has been limited by the development of drug resistance and by poor potency and selectivity profiles that lead to off-target toxicities or diminished efficacy. In addition, currently approved kinase inhibitors target fewer than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to develop novel kinase inhibitor therapies. Inhibitors of one class of kinases, the immunokinases, may represent a particularly promising approach to target key mechanisms of tumor immunotolerance that limit effectiveness of other I/O therapies. 
 Within almost all kinases, a molecular control known as the activation switch governs whether the kinase is in the inactive or the active state. Most of the time kinases are in an inactive state and are triggered into the active state when they are needed to direct normal cellular functions. Mutations within kinases, particularly those that involve the activation switch region, can cause uncontrolled kinase signaling within the cell. In addition, kinases may acquire further mutations during treatment with traditional kinase inhibitors that confer resistance to these kinase inhibitors. We designate the region of the gene that encodes the kinase, or exon, when referring to a particular mutation. Kinase activity also may be amplified through the aberrant development of multiple copies of the relevant gene. These aggressively activated mutated or amplified kinases can drive rapid, uncontrolled growth and spread of tumors. 
 In addition to mutated kinases, certain kinases known as immunokinases also play a role in the development of cancer through the suppression of the immune system. Tumors suppress immune system cells, such as macrophages and T-cells, essentially shutting off their ability to identify and destroy cancer cells. For instance, tumors may suppress the immune system by sending a signal that activates an immunokinase in immune system cells. The activated kinase then initiates internal signaling within the immune system cells to suppress their function and prevent them from identifying and destroying the cancer cells. A recent development in cancer therapy, referred to as immuno-oncology, or I/O, uses advances in understanding of the control of the immune system to develop drugs that enhance the ability of immune system cells to recognize and attack cancer cells. Based on our preclinical data we believe inhibiting immunokinases has the potential to improve the rate and duration of response of other I/O therapies. Our immunokinase programs targeting tumoral macrophages also target inhibition of macrophage-mediated angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. 
 Our Approach: Kinase Switch Control Inhibitors 
 We created our diverse pipeline of drug candidates entirely in-house using our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform. We developed our platform based on our deep insight into the biology of kinases, which are regulated by control of their shape, or conformation. The transformation of a kinase from an inactive to an activated state is dependent upon the interaction of one region of the kinase called the activation switch with 
 
8 


  another region called the switch pocket. This activation switch mechanism is common among kinases. Some kinases also can be activated if the activity of an inhibitory switch that ordinarily blocks the ability of the activation switch to interact with the switch pocket is diminished or lost. Our drug candidates, which we refer to as kinase switch control inhibitors, directly interfere with the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket and prevent kinase activation. While the interaction between the activation switch and the switch pocket is common among kinases, the molecular structure of the activation switch and the switch pocket varies among kinases. We take advantage of this variation to design molecules that inhibit a specific kinase or kinases. 
 Our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform includes a library of drug-like, kinase switch control compounds. We have determined and assessed more than 100 co-crystal structures where our compounds are bound into the switch pocket of specific kinases. We use this information to identify and optimize candidate molecules that are specifically designed to interact with the switch pocket. By directly targeting the switch pocket, we believe we can design inhibitors that will be broadly active against the target kinase, covering both wild-type and many or all of the known mutant or amplified forms, or spectrum-selective towards several chosen kinases. 
 We believe that other kinase inhibitors on the market or active in clinical development do not directly target the switch pocket region and that we are the only biopharmaceutical company that is currently developing kinase switch control inhibitors. Using our kinase switch control inhibitor platform, we have developed a diverse pipeline of differentiated, wholly owned, orally administered drug candidates that include three clinical-stage and two research-stage programs. Our kinase switch control inhibitors interact at a molecular level that is distinct from other kinase inhibitors. We believe our drug candidates may contribute to higher and more durable rates of response as compared to other kinase inhibitors, including where multiple mutations confer resistance to these other kinase inhibitors. In addition, because our drug candidates bind directly into the switch pocket at the site where the activation switch binds, we believe mutations in the switch pocket region that could potentially diminish the activity of our drug candidates are likely to result in a weakly activated or inactive kinase. 
 The image below illustrates activation of the switch pocket and how our switch control inhibitors embed into the switch pocket thereby inhibiting switch activation. 
 


While we believe that our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform offers the benefits described above, there are certain limitations of our platform, including its inability to control inhibition of certain kinases that interfere with access to the switch pocket, including cyclin dependent kinases and specific kinases in the MAPK family (MEK and ERK), which constitute less than 10% of the over 500 known human kinases as well as the inability of our laboratory assays to support high-throughput screening, resulting in limitations on the number of molecules that can be screened.

 Our Drug Candidates 
 We are leveraging our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to develop a pipeline of highly selective, potent small molecule drug candidates that directly inhibit activation of kinases implicated in the growth and spread of cancers. Our platform allows us to rapidly identify new drug candidates to enter preclinical development. We currently retain global development and commercialization rights to our drug candidates, including the lead programs summarized in the following figure: 
 


Ripretinib: A Broad-spectrum KIT and PDGFRα
 Inhibitor 
 We are developing our lead drug candidate ripretinib, an orally administered kinase switch control inhibitor, for the treatment of GIST, ASM, and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα where significant unmet medical need exists despite currently available therapies. While approved kinase inhibitors control certain initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT and PDGFRα, the kinases that drive disease progression in most GIST patients, these approved drugs fail to inhibit all known mutations. We designed ripretinib to improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting the full spectrum of the known mutations in KIT and PDGFRα. Ripretinib is a KIT and PDGFRα switch control inhibitor that blocks initiating and resistance KIT mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, and 18 known to be present in GIST patients and the primary mutation in exon 17 that occurs in ASM patients. Ripretinib similarly inhibits the primary initiating PDGFRα mutations occurring in exons 12 and 18 and also inhibits wild-type PDGFRα that is subject to amplification in cancers such as gliomas and NSCLC. 
 In October 2018, at the ESMO 2018 Congress, we reported updated preliminary data from our ongoing Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of ripretinib in multiple ascending doses in patients with genetically defined advanced malignancies. We reported updated safety data from a total of 178 GIST patients receiving doses of at least 100 mg daily. Ripretinib was well tolerated at all doses up to 400 mg daily. In addition, we reported preliminary efficacy data from 178 patients with GIST, including 38 second-line, 29 third-line and 111 fourth- and fourth-line plus patients. In 67 second- and third-line patients we observed a preliminary mPFS of 40 weeks, an ORR of 21% and a DCR of 81%. In 111 fourth- and fourth-line plus GIST patients, we observed a preliminary mPFS of 24 weeks, an ORR of 9% and a DCR of 66%. The best response and DCRs described above are based on investigator assessment of tumor response in a small number of patients and may not be predictive of or consistent with the results of later trials.

 Our first Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, in fourth-line and fourth-line plus GIST patients, where there are currently no approved therapies, was fully enrolled as of November 2018, with top-line results expected in mid-2019. Our second Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, in second-line GIST patients, was initiated in December 2018. In addition, we have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST, as well as in patients with ASM and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC, and soft tissue sarcomas. We expect to report data from some of these expansion cohorts in 2019. 
 Ripretinib Mechanism of Action 
 KIT is activated by the interaction of an activation switch encoded in exons 17 and 18 with the switch pocket encoded primarily in exons 13 and 14. This interaction is negatively controlled by an inhibitory switch in exon 11 that competes for the switch pocket. Loss-of-function mutations in the exon 11 inhibitory switch, which are the primary, or activating, mutations in approximately 90% of KIT-driven GIST patients, allow uncontrolled access to the switch pocket by the activation switch. In drug resistant GIST, unregulated access of the activation switch to the switch pocket is further enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in exon 17 or 18. Such dual loss-of-function mutations in the inhibitory switch and gain-of-function mutation in the activation switch leads to an aggressively activated state that is not comprehensively blocked by conventional KIT inhibitors. By binding into the switch pocket, ripretinib provides a structural surrogate for loss-of-function mutations in the exon 11 inhibitory switch. Additionally, binding of ripretinib into the switch pocket inhibits even the most aggressive exons 17 and 18 gain-of-function mutation in the activation switch from occupying the switch pocket. This dual mechanism of kinase switch control also enables ripretinib to potently inhibit KIT exons 9, 13, and 14 mutations identified in some GIST patients. 
 PDGFRα has a similar dual switch mechanism: an exon 18 activation switch and an exon 12 inhibitory switch. Ripretinib blocks the effects of both loss-of-function PDGFRα exon 12 inhibitory switch mutations and aggressive PDGFRα gain-of-function mutations in the exon 18 activation switch. 
 Market Opportunity in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) 
 GISTs are the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract and present most often in the stomach or small intestine. The typical patient is over 40 years old. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2015 approximately 5,000 patients were newly diagnosed with GIST in the United States. Estimates for 5-year survival range from 48% to 90% depending upon the stage of the disease at diagnosis. We believe that the incidence rates for GIST in Europe are similar to the United States, ranging from 10 to 15 per 1,000,000 population. 
 GIST is a disease driven initially by primary mutations in KIT kinase in approximately 75% to 80% of cases or in PDGFRα kinase in approximately 5% to 10% of cases. In about 9% to 15% of all GIST patients, which includes 85% of the cases in children, the disease is not driven by KIT or PDGFRα but by other genetic mutations or alterations. Primary mutations in the KIT gene are found in exon 11 in approximately 65% of GIST patients, in exon 9 in approximately 8% of GIST patients, and less frequently in exon 13 or 17. Primary mutations in the PDGFRα gene are usually found in exon 18 (a mutation referred to as D842V being the most frequent) and more rarely in exon 12. Activation of these kinases caused by primary mutations leads to 
 
11 


  uncontrolled cancer cell growth and spread. The diagram below illustrates the mutations that drive GIST, assuming 75% are KIT-driven, the lower end of the range cited by various sources. 
 

Metastatic KIT-driven GIST is a disease characterized by many mutations in KIT, with over 90% of individual KIT-driven GIST patients harboring multiple mutations that drive progression of their disease. Multiple secondary mutations can arise within an individual patient in different areas or sites of tumor growth. Drug resistant secondary mutations in patients with KIT-driven GIST span exon regions 13 to 18, and in a recent study, 35% of GIST patients had at least two secondary mutations, each as illustrated below. 
 


The complex heterogeneity of KIT mutations within individual tumors and individual patients is a major cause of resistance to existing therapies, which individually only address a subset of the mutations driving disease progression. A kinase inhibitor that could inhibit a broad spectrum of clinically relevant KIT mutations could be of high therapeutic value in the treatment of KIT-driven GIST in patients who are unresponsive to treatment or have grown resistant to treatment. In PDGFRα-driven GIST, there are no approved therapies. The primary PDGFRα mutations are mostly insensitive to imatinib and other drugs approved for GIST. We believe our design of ripretinib as a PDGFRα switch control inhibitor may make the appearance of secondary mutations less likely after treatment than with a traditional kinase inhibitor.

 First-line Treatments For GIST 
 Patients diagnosed early with localized GIST generally undergo surgical resection of their tumors. In surgically resected patients considered at a high risk of recurrence and in unresectable or metastatic patients, the kinase inhibitor imatinib is the only approved first-line therapy in the United States. Imatinib is typically prescribed in doses of 400 mg or 800 mg daily. Tumors are measured by CT scan and changes in size characterized by RECIST. RECIST criteria define a partial response, or PR, as tumor size reduction of 30% or more, a complete response, or CR, as tumor size reduced by 100%, and progressive disease, or PD, as an increase in tumor size by 20% or more. RECIST criteria define stable disease as that in between a PR or PD. In one Phase 3 trial of GIST patients with unresectable or metastatic disease treated with imatinib, CRs were seen in only about 5% of patients dosed at 400 mg QD and aggregate CRs and PRs, which is defined as best tumor response rate, were seen in approximately 45% of these patients. Patients with PDGFRα-driven GIST are mostly insensitive to imatinib and generally fail to respond to therapy. While imatinib generally is well-tolerated, in one clinical study involving patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib daily, 43% experienced one or more Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, 16% underwent dose reductions and 38% interrupted treatment. Among patients treated with 800 mg of imatinib daily, 58% had dose reductions and 59% interrupted treatment. 
 Disease progression in advanced GIST is often due to secondary mutations in KIT or PDGFRα that cause resistance to imatinib. Although imatinib is effective against KIT mutations in exon 11 and has some limited efficacy against exon 9 mutations when the dose is increased from 400 mg to 800 mg daily, secondary mutations in KIT in exons 13, 14, 17 and 18 or most primary mutations in PDGFRα confer resistance to imatinib. While more than 80% of GIST patients will see some clinical benefit from imatinib monotherapy, and a small portion of patients have shown progression-free survival, or PFS, up to ten years, greater than 50% of patients will develop PD by two years, and 90% at ten years. Of the approximately 5,000 GIST patients that are reported as newly diagnosed each year in the United States, we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease and 90% will receive first-line treatment with imatinib. Most of these imatinib treated patients, or approximately 2,600, will be eligible to progress to second-line therapy. 
 Second- and Third-line Treatments For GIST 
 In KIT-driven GIST patients who progress on imatinib the clinical goal is stabilization of their disease. Objective responses, as judged by a RECIST-defined decrease in the size of measurable lesions, are rare and increasingly considered on their own to be poor surrogates for clinical benefit in second- and third-line patients. FDA recognized endpoint for approval of the two approved agents for second- and third-line therapies in GIST was time-to-tumor-progression, or TTP, or PFS, respectively. We believe that the rate of disease control, which includes patients with stable disease and PRs and CRs, is an appropriate measure of clinically relevant activity and a likely predictor of PFS and durability of treatment. In GIST patients who progress on imatinib, second-line therapy is typically sunitinib, which was approved in 2006 for patients with GIST who had disease progression following treatment with, or intolerance to, imatinib. Sunitinib has greater activity against mutations in KIT exon 9 compared to imatinib and less activity against mutations in KIT exon 11. Additionally, sunitinib shows activity against KIT exon 13 and exon 14 mutations, but is not active against mutations in exon 17 and exon 18. Only about half of GIST patients show benefit on sunitinib therapy and the reported TTP is 6.1 months. Unlike treatment with imatinib in first-line therapy, sunitinib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST (on a confirmed and centrally read basis), or objective response rate, of approximately 7%. Approximately 5% to 10% of GIST patients on sunitinib experienced each of the following Grade 3 or 4 adverse events: hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia and hand-foot syndrome. In two large retrospective studies of sunitinib in GIST, 20% of patients experienced adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. The emergence of KIT mutations in exon 17 or 18 confers resistance to sunitinib. 
 In 2013, regorafenib received marketing approval in the United Sates for the treatment of adults with metastatic and unresectable GIST who have experienced disease progression on, or intolerance to, imatinib and sunitinib. In addition to being active against KIT mutations in exon 11, regorafenib is the only approved therapy 
 
13 


  with activity against a subset of KIT mutations in exon 17. However, regorafenib does not inhibit all KIT mutations in exon 17 or exon 18. The reported median PFS with regorafenib is 4.8 months. Similar to treatment with sunitinib, regorafenib rarely produces CRs or PRs per RECIST as shown by the objective response rate of approximately 4.5%. Approximately 61% of GIST patients on regorafenib experienced at least one Grade 3 or 4 adverse event while on study including hypertension (23%), hand-foot syndrome (20%), and diarrhea (5%). Regorafenib also has shown increased liver toxicity. Liver function tests are recommended prior to initiation of therapy and periodically over the first two months of treatment. 
 The following table shows reported PFS or TTP (as applicable), objective response rate, stable disease, and DCRs, all as per RECIST, for imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib in first-line, second-line, and third-line GIST, respectively, based upon the published results of registrational trials that were presented to FDA for approval of these drugs. 
 


While imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, the only kinase inhibitors currently approved for the treatment of GIST, inhibit certain clinically relevant initiating and drug resistance-causing mutations in KIT, these approved drugs each inhibit only a limited subset of KIT and PDGFRα mutations known to occur in GIST patients. Although GIST patients may experience periods of disease control with these treatments, due to the heterogeneous nature of the mutations that drive the disease, many patients continue to progress and ultimately fail all lines of treatment. Of the approximately 5,000 GIST patients newly diagnosed each year in the United States we estimate that about 65% will experience metastatic disease and of these about 2,100 will fail second-line and third-line therapies and become fourth-line patients and about 2,600 will fail first-line therapies and become second-line patients. We estimate the annual incidence of new patients with GIST to be approximately 9,500 in Europe and Japan, of which we estimate that approximately 4,000 and 5,000 will become eligible as fourth- and second-line patients, respectively. Treatment of GIST patients who are resistant to or intolerant of these approved second- and third-line drugs remains an area of high unmet medical need. In addition, there are currently no approved therapeutic options for PDGFRα-driven GIST that potently inhibit D842V mutations, which is the most common mutation. We estimate that approximately 400 and 700 GIST patients have PDGFRα-driven disease in the United States and Europe and Japan combined, respectively. In preclinical assays, ripretinib is potently active against the D842V mutation and other PDGFRα primary mutations. We believe that ripretinib may offer a potential new treatment for these patients in addition to those patients who failed currently approved kinase inhibitors.

 Clinical Development of Ripretinib 
 Ongoing Phase 3 Studies for Ripretinib in GIST 
 INVICTUS: Ongoing Phase 3 Study in Fourth-Line and Fourth-Line Plus GIST 
 In November 2018, we announced completion of enrollment in the Phase 3 study, INVICTUS, evaluating the safety and efficacy of ripretinib in fourth-line and fourth-line-plus GIST patients. We expect to report initial top-line data from this randomized, double-blind study in mid-2019 and, if positive, we believe the results would support a New Drug Application, or NDA, for full approval of ripretinib for the treatment of fourth-line and fourth-line-plus GIST patients in the United States, and similar applications in Europe and other major markets. 
 The INVICTUS Phase 3 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ripretinib compared to placebo in patients with advanced GIST whose previous therapies have included imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib. We enrolled 129 patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of GIST and had previously received at least three different kinase inhibitors including imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib. Patients are treated with ripretinib or placebo, in accordance with their randomization, until they develop PD, experience unacceptable toxicity, or withdraw consent. Placebo patients have the opportunity to cross over to ripretinib treatment upon PD with placebo. Patients on ripretinib have the opportunity to remain on ripretinib upon PD. 
 Patients were randomized 2:1 to either 150 mg of ripretinib or placebo once daily. We administer 150 mg doses of ripretinib or placebo once daily, or QD, in repeated 28-day cycles with best supportive care, or BSC. We are evaluating patients for PFS based upon independent radiologic review of CT scans, as assessed by RECIST. Tumor response assessments per RECIST are conducted every cycle for the first three cycles and then every two cycles thereafter beginning with the fourth cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST include objective response rate, time to tumor progression, and overall survival. 
 INTRIGUE: Ongoing Phase 3 Study in Second-Line GIST 
 In December 2018, we initiated enrollment in a pivotal Phase 3 study, INTRIGUE, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ripretinib compared to sunitinib in second-line GIST patients. We believe that the results from INTRIGUE, if positive, would support an NDA for full approval in second-line GIST patients in the United States, and similar applications in Europe and other major markets. 
 The INTRIGUE Phase 3 study is an interventional, randomized, global, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ripretinib compared to sunitinib in patients with GIST previously treated with imatinib. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 150 mg of ripretinib once daily or 50 mg of sunitinib once daily for four weeks followed by two weeks without sunitinib. The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST. Secondary endpoints as determined by independent radiologic review using modified RECIST include objective response rate and overall survival. 
 Phase 1 Trial of Ripretinib in GIST and Other Solid Tumors 
 We have an ongoing Phase 1 trial studying ripretinib in patients with different stages of GIST, as well as in patients with ASM and other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC, and soft tissue sarcomas. 
 Dose Escalation Stage of Phase 1 Trial 
 The primary objectives of the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1 trial were to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, of ripretinib and to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose. 
 
15 


  The secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of ripretinib and to document preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. The safety endpoints of the escalation phase of the Phase 1 trial included dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, and adverse events. The endpoints for preliminary assessment of antitumor activity included ORR and DCR at 12 weeks. Other endpoints included PFS, which is defined as time from Cycle 1 Day 1 to disease progression or death, for all solid tumor patients. 
 The Phase 1 trial included a screening visit that was conducted within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug, a baseline visit, a treatment period of 28-day cycles, an intra-patient dose-escalation (if applicable for some patients), a final study visit, and a follow-up safety visit within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Patients were excluded from the trial if they received treatment with anticancer therapy, including investigational therapy, within two weeks prior to the administration of study drug, with the exception of hydroxyurea, which was permitted to control white blood cell count in patients with hematological malignancies. Patients who received prior therapies with a half-life longer than three days were required to wait at least 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug. 
 We administered sequentially increasing doses of ripretinib QD, or once daily, or BID, or twice daily, in repeated 28-day cycles, which were evaluated for safety based on pharmacologically guided 3+3 escalation rules where three patients are initially enrolled into a given dose cohort. If no DLT is observed in any of these subjects, the trial proceeds to enroll three subjects into the next higher dose cohort until an MTD is identified or a recommended expansion dose is declared. MTD is determined to be the dose level immediately below the highest dose level tested where two DLTs were observed. This process is known as 3+3 dose escalation. 
 Solid tumors generally were measured by CT or MRI scan, as assessed according to RECIST per local investigator assessment. Malignant gliomas were measured by MRI scan and assessed by RECIST or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology, or RANO, Criteria. We conducted CT or MRI scans, as applicable, of each patient at baseline, at the end of the second four-week cycle, after eight weeks of therapy, and every eight weeks thereafter. Response in systemic mastocytosis, or SM, patients is measured by assessing, among other things, the frequency with which KIT mutation alleles appear in sample tissues. 
 For pharmacodynamics assessments in GIST and other solid tumor patients, plasma samples are taken from patients to extract cell-free DNA, or cfDNA, which is DNA that is freely circulating in the bloodstream and not necessarily originating from a tumor. We then analyze the cfDNA to identify the type and amount of KIT or PDGFRα mutations in the cfDNA that originated from tumors, which are known as circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. In ASM patients, changes in whole blood D816V KIT allele fraction are evaluated. Metabolic response as measured by FDG-PET scans was assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria in GIST patients. 
 Ongoing Expansion Stage of Phase 1 Trial 
 The primary objectives of the expansion stage of the Phase 1 trial are to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ripretinib and to determine the antitumor activity of ripretinib in all diseases studied in the trial. The secondary objectives are to determine the PK profile of ripretinib and determine allele frequency of KIT and PDGFRα mutations in ctDNA and compare it with mutation allele frequency in GIST tumor tissue at baseline and in response to treatment of ripretinib. The safety endpoints of the expansion phase of the Phase 1 trial include dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug due to toxicity and adverse events. The endpoints for preliminary assessment of antitumor activity include ORR and DCR at 12 weeks. Other endpoints include PFS for all solid tumor patients. In addition, patient reported outcome measures may be used to confirm the recommended expansion dose. 
 In the expansion stage, up to 270 patients will be enrolled in 10 cohorts including three GIST cohorts, one for each of second/third-, fourth-, and fourth-line plus GIST, one for GIST or other solid tumor patients with renal impairment, one cohort for SM with other hematologic malignancies, and five cohorts for other KIT and 
 
16 


  PDGFRα-driven solid tumors, including an other solid tumor cohort, and one for each of malignant gliomas, NSCLC/germ cell/penile, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma. We have completed enrollment in three of the GIST cohorts and ten patient other solid tumor cohort and are continuing to enroll in the other expansion cohorts. 
 The expansion stage of the Phase 1 trial includes a screening visit that is conducted within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug, a baseline visit, a treatment period of 28-day cycles, a final study visit, and a follow-up safety visit within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Intra-patient dose escalation is offered to patients upon radiographic progression. Patients are not eligible for the trial if they received treatment with anticancer therapy, including investigational therapy, within two weeks prior to the administration of ripretinib. Patients who received prior therapies with a half-life longer than three days are required to wait at least 28 days prior to the first administration of ripretinib. 
 We will administer ripretinib at the recommended expansion dose of 150 mg QD that was determined during the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1 trial. Patients who have disease progression by specified indication response criteria in the expansion stage may escalate to the higher daily dose (150 mg BID) of ripretinib after completion of the second cycle. In addition, we are planning to evaluate the higher daily dose in SM patients and, where appropriate, consider doing so in other non-GIST cohorts. Tumor and pharmacodynamic assessments in the expansion stage will generally be conducted in the same manner and according to the same criteria as in the dose escalation stage. 
 ESMO 2018 Data Presentation on Phase 1 Trial in GIST Patients at doses ³100mg Daily 
 We announced updated preliminary results from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical study of ripretinib in patients with GIST at a presentation at ESMO 2018. The chart below summarizes the demographic profile of the patients for whom data was presented at ESMO 2018: 
 


Notes: (1) Mean number of prior regimens for ³4th line patients was 3.6.
At ESMO 2018, we reported preliminary results with a cutoff date of August 31, 2018 that include mPFS, ORR, and DCR at three months in each case as determined by investigator-assessed RECIST version 1.1 across 178 patients receiving ripritenib at doses of >100mg daily.

 In a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing imatinib re-challenge to placebo, in patients in a similar third- or fourth-line setting, the median PFS observed in the placebo-treated group was 0.9 months. Similarly, in the randomized placebo-controlled regorafenib pivotal trial in third-line GIST patients, the median PFS observed in the placebo-treated group was also 0.9 months. In its pivotal trial, sunitinib demonstrated a TTP of 6.1 months and the TTP observed in the placebo-treated group was 1.4 months. 
 Duration of Treatment of GIST Patients in Ongoing Phase 1 Trial 
 The following figure shows the duration of treatment with ripretinib, as of the cutoff date, for second- and third-line GIST patients in the Phase 1 trial who had received ³ 100 mg of ripretinib daily. In the second-line GIST patients, as of the cutoff date, 17 patients received ripretinib at doses of ³100mg daily for more than six months with 65% (11 of 17) of these patients remaining on study. In third-line GIST patients, as of the cutoff date, 20 patients received ripretinib at doses of ³100mg daily for more than six months with 75% (15 of 20) of these patients remaining on study. 
 Preliminary Data with Ripretinib at ³ 100 mg Daily Showed Emerging Durability



In addition to the data presented at ESMO 2018, we also observed the following in the fourth-line and fourth-line-plus GIST patients; as of the cutoff date, of the 46 combined fourth- and fourth-line plus GIST patients that received ripretinib at doses of ³100mg daily for more than six months, 74% (34 of 46) of these patients remained on study. 
 Safety and Tolerability of GIST Patients Treated with Ripretinib in Ongoing Phase 1 Trial at ESMO 2018 
 At ESMO 2018, we presented updated safety and tolerability data on 178 GIST patients treated at doses >100mg daily, and observed that ripretinib was generally well tolerated. Among the treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, reported by investigators (>10%), regardless of relationship to ripretinib, the most common were: alopecia (50%), myalgia (44%), fatigue (43%), constipation (34%), hand-foot skin reaction (32%), nausea (30%), decreased appetite (28%), weight decreased (24%), abdominal pain (23%), diarrhea (23%) and lipase increase (23%). Clinically asymptomatic lipase elevations were the most frequent Grade 3 TEAE. Among the 178 GIST patients treated at doses >100mg daily: 14% (24 patients) experienced dose reductions due to TEAEs and 11% (19 patients) experienced treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs. The treatment emergent adverse events in greater than 10% of GIST patients at or above 100mg daily (n=178) by Grades 1/2 and Grades 3/4 are summarized in the table below.

 Reduction of KIT and PDGFRα Mutant Allele Frequencies in Patients in Phase 1 Trial 
One of the exploratory objectives of our Phase 1 trial of ripretinib is to understand the KIT and PDGFRα mutation status at baseline identified in ctDNA of GIST patients and their association with study drug response. Next generation sequencing, or NGS, is used to identify and quantify the specific mutations in KIT and PDGFRα that are present in baseline patient samples and those obtained after treatment with ripretinib. 
 At the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, or ASCO 2018, in June 2018, we presented data on the mutational status of 131 GIST patients, of which 95 had KIT-driven mutations in ctDNA, by exon, as summarized in the following figure. 
 KIT Mutations in ctDNA (n=95) 
 In 131 GIST Patients by Line of Therapy 
 


Maximum Change in ctDNA Mutant Allele Frequency in KIT-driven GIST Patients 
 The following figure, which was also included in our ASCO 2018 presentation, shows the maximum change in ctDNA mutant allele frequency, or MAF, by exon in 73 patients with circulating KIT mutations observed at baseline and having data from at least one sample following treatment with ripretinib. We observed in this group of KIT-positive GIST patients that treatment with ripretinib resulted in reductions of least 50% in the frequency of ctDNA mutant KIT alleles in 78% (57 of 73) of patients, with 48% (35 of 73) of patients becoming KIT-negative on treatment.

 13, 14, 17 and 18 by Lines of Therapy (n=73)(1)
(Note log scale: -1 = 10-fold reduction, -2 = 100-fold reduction) 
 


These clinical results complement the preclinical results previously presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2018, or AACR 2018, where we reported that ripretinib exhibited robust in vitro inhibition of a broad range of relevant drug resistance mutations of KIT and PDGFRα. Since oral administration of ripretinib results in the production of an active metabolite DP-5439, we also evaluated the potency of DP-5439 against these mutations which was consistent with ripretinib. 
 In summary, whether it is the known primary mutations in KIT that initiate GIST or secondary mutations in KIT that subsequently confer drug resistance, we believe the data presented at the ASCO 2018 Meeting and AACR 2018 demonstrated potent clinical inhibition of a broad range of these mutations by ripretinib. In addition, we believe the ctDNA data demonstrate the need for a broad spectrum KIT inhibitor to address the multiple KIT mutations seen in patients from second-line to fourth-line plus. The reductions in ctDNA KIT mutant allele frequencies described above were from a total sample of 73 patients with KIT-driven GIST. Our trial sizes to date have been limited. We are enrolling a larger number of patients, which will include additional patients with KIT-driven GIST, in the expansion stage of our Phase 1 trial and in our two ongoing Phase 3 trials of ripretinib. 
 Development of Ripretinib in Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) 
 Mastocytosis is a disease characterized by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells, a type of white blood cell, located in peripheral tissues and organs. Mast cells store components that mediate inflammatory and allergic responses, such as tryptase, histamine, serotonin and heparin. The disease can be sub-divided into cutaneous mastocytosis where mast cells accumulate only in the skin and SM where mast cells accumulate in at least one organ (with or without skin involvement). In adults, most cases are systemic, frequently with accompanying skin involvement, whereas in children cutaneous mastocytosis is more common and many of the cases resolve spontaneously. While the exact number of patients suffering from all forms of mastocytosis, including urticaria pigmentosa, is not known, it is estimated that about 3,000 patients are newly diagnosed each year in the United States and about 30,000 patients live with the disease in the United States. Within SM there are four main sub-types: indolent and smoldering, or ISM, aggressive SM, SM with associated hematological neoplasm, or SM-AHN, and mast cell leukemia, or MCL. ASM includes aggressive SM, SM-AHN and MCL. We estimate the annual incidence of new patients with ASM to be approximately 1,400 and 2,800 in the United States and Europe 
 
23 


  and Japan combined, respectively. Rates of survival vary significantly between the various sub-types, from normal in patients with ISM to significantly less than one year in patients with MCL. The chart below summarizes the prognosis, or likely course of the disease, and survival, or the time from which primary treatment begins, until death. 
 Subtypes of Systemic Mastocytosis 
 


Approximately 94% of SM patients are reported to have a somatic D816V mutation in KIT. This D816V mutation is a gain-of-function mutation in the KIT activation switch, which leads to unregulated KIT activation. The KIT receptor, which is widely expressed on mast cells, stimulates signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation and survival. The gain-of-function mutation, D816V, enables mast cells to proliferate in the absence of normal activation signals. Approved drugs to manage the symptoms include antihistamines, corticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists, epinephrine salbutamol and other beta-2 agonists. Midostaurin, which targets various kinases including FLT3, PDGFRα, CDK1, Src, KIT and VEGFR, was approved for the treatment of ASM and MCL in April 2017 in the United States based on response rate and duration in a single-arm, open-label study of midostaurin 100 mg orally twice daily. Ripretinib potently inhibits the D816V mutation. We are enrolling ASM patients within an expansion cohort of our Phase 1 trial. 
Development of Ripretinib in Other Solid Tumors 
 In the expansion stage of the Phase 1 trial of ripretinib, we are enrolling other solid tumors driven by KIT or PDGFRα including gliomas, melanoma, NSCLC/germ cell/penile, and soft tissue sarcomas. 
Preclinical Profile of Ripretinib 
 We specifically designed ripretinib, our KIT and PDGFRα switch control inhibitor, to improve the treatment of GIST patients by inhibiting the full spectrum of the known mutant KIT and PDGFRα kinases responsible for initiating the disease, or primary mutations, and the KIT mutations that cause drug resistance or secondary mutations. 
 In April 2018, at AACR 2018, we presented updated preclinical data that describes the breadth of inhibition achieved with ripretinib and its active metabolite, DP-5439, across both primary and secondary KIT mutations 
 
24 


  and primary PDGFRα mutations compared to the in vitro profiles of the FDA-approved kinase inhibitors, imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, midostaurin and the investigational drug, avapritinib. Potency is measured by the concentration of ripretinib or DP-5439 required to inhibit kinase activity by 50%, or the inhibitory concentration 50%, or IC50. The lower the bar in the following graphs, the greater the potency. Compared to the approved and investigational compounds tested, ripretinib and its active metabolite, DP-5439, exhibited the broadest profile of inhibition across primary and secondary drug-resistant KIT mutations, and primary mutations in PDGFRα. 
 








In enzyme assays at relevant cellular levels of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, ripretinib broadly inhibited primary and drug-resistant KIT mutations and primary PDGFRα mutations. Ripretinib also broadly inhibited 
 
25 


  KIT and PDGFRα mutations in a panel of GIST, mastocytosis, leukemia, lung cancer, and transfected cell assays. 
 


The data presented above demonstrate the ability of ripretinib to inhibit known KIT and PDGFRα initiating mutations and KIT drug resistance mutations. These results against the broad range of KIT mutations known to occur in GIST patients provides preclinical data that support a broad-spectrum KIT profile observed with ripretinib in reducing ctDNA MAF in all clinically relevant exons. 
 We also evaluated the potential resilience of ripretinib to new gain-of-function KIT resistance mutations to kinase switch control inhibition. To that end, we performed saturation mutagenesis studies in cells to examine the emergence of new mutations in KIT following exposure to ripretinib or imatinib. The results demonstrate that, while new KIT drug resistance mutations are produced rapidly in response to imatinib exposure (four new mutations secondary to exposure were recorded), we observed no gain-of-function KIT mutations resistant to ripretinib. These results further support the broad-spectrum KIT inhibitor profile of ripretinib and its potential resilience to the emergence of mutations resistant to kinase switch control inhibition. 
 DCC-3014: A Potent and Highly Selective Inhibitor of CSF1R 
 DCC-3014 is an orally administered, potent and highly selective inhibitor of CSF1R, also known as FMS. DCC-3014 was designed to selectively bind to the CSF1R switch pocket. It has greater than 100-fold selectivity for CSF1R over the closely related kinases FLT3, KIT, PDGFRα, PDGFRß and VEGFR2 and has an even greater selectivity for CSF1R over approximately 300 other human kinases that we tested. 
 Ongoing Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial of DCC-3014
In January 2019, we announced positive, preliminary, top-line data from the ongoing dose escalation part of the Phase 1 trial with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies. In addition, we announced a plan to expand the Phase 1 trial to evaluate DCC-3014 in patients diagnosed with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumors, or TGCT. We anticipate presenting a review of further data from this Phase 1 trial at a medical meeting later in 2019. The Phase 1 trial was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of DCC-3014 in up to 55 patients. Preliminary results from the Phase 1 trial are summarized below: 
 

 | As of the data cut-off date of November 9, 2018, increasing doses of DCC-3014 were assessed in five dose cohorts across 24 patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. This included one dose cohort that received 10 mg QD and four dose cohorts that followed a schedule of once or twice-weekly maintenance dosing preceded by a five-day loading dose regimen at doses of up to 30 mg per dose. In addition, four patients are currently enrolled in a dose cohort that will receive 40 mg twice weekly preceded by a five-day loading regimen. Dosing schedules exploring daily maintenance regimens are expected to also be evaluated.

 | Preliminary PK analysis showed dose-proportional exposure for DCC-3014 that we believe supports twice-weekly maintenance dosing preceded by a five-day loading dose regimen.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Biomarker data demonstrated strong target engagement of CSF1R, including material reductions in CSF1R positive macrophages in the blood that we believe constitutes mechanistic proof-of-concept, or mPoC, for DCC-3014.

 | DCC-3014 was generally well tolerated in patients enrolled in the dose cohorts that received twice-weekly maintenance doses of DCC-3014 preceded by a five-day loading regimen at doses of up to 30 mg, which is summarized below:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planned Expansion of Phase 1 Trial in Patients with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumors 
 We are planning to expand the Phase 1 trial to enroll patients with TGCT and to explore combinations with other therapies in the first half of 2019. TGCTs are a group of benign tumors that involve the synovium, bursae and/or tendon sheath. Although benign, these tumors can grow and cause damage to surrounding tissues and structures inducing pain, swelling, and limitation of movement of the joint. Surgery is the main treatment option; however, these tumors tend to recur, particularly in pigmented villonodular synovitis, a diffuse-type of TGCT. If untreated or if the tumor continually recurs damage and degeneration may occur in the affected joint and surrounding tissues, which may cause significant disability. A genetic mutation in certain cells within the tumor causes overproduction of CSF-1, the ligand for the CSF1R receptor, which attracts macrophages and certain other cells that become the bulk of these tumors and cause the associated inflammatory changes. 
 Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of DCC-3014
We evaluated the selectivity of DCC-3014 for CSF1R in a standard biochemical assay, called a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of DCC-3014 at which it inhibits CSF1R and other kinases. We conducted this assay in the presence of adenosine tri-phosphate, or ATP. ATP is essential for kinase activation, and the presence of higher concentrations of ATP increases the activity of kinases. The potency of traditional kinase inhibitors is often highly sensitive to increased ATP. 
 The following figure on the left depicts the results of the kinome screen assay using a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay. Each kinase in the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by DCC-3014 is depicted as a red dot and listed in the key to the figure. IC50 values are depicted by the size of the dots, where larger dots reflect greater potency for a given kinase while smaller dots reflect lesser potency. For each kinase that DCC-3014 inhibited in the kinome screen assay, we then assessed the inhibiting activity in a separate biochemical assay using a 4 millimolar concentration of ATP, equivalent to that present in human cells. The following figure on the right depicts the results of this second assay. As shown below, DCC-3014 inhibits CSF1R at concentrations much lower than the concentrations at which it inhibits other kinases, and this selective inhibition of CSF1R was more pronounced at the higher concentrations of ATP typically found in human cells. The increase in selectivity is a feature of kinase switch control inhibition, which is not affected by high ATP concentration for targeted kinases.

 DCC-3014 Exhibits High Selectivity for CSF1R at Low, Screening 
 Concentrations of ATP (10 µM) and Even Higher Selectively at Cellular Levels of ATP (4 mM) 
 


CSF1R is a receptor for the ligands Macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor, or MCSF, and interleukin 34, or IL34. CSF1R controls the differentiation and function of macrophages, a type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes and cancer cells. These macrophages are also programmed to either activate the immune system to fight a cancer (so-called M1 macrophages) or programmed to inactivate the immune system and promote tumor growth (so-called M2 macrophages). Pro-tumoral M2 macrophages have been shown to infiltrate certain tumors including cancers of the breast, cervix, pancreas, bladder and brain where poor prognosis correlates with the density of these TAMs. Tumors induce TAMs to suppress a natural immune response mediated by cytotoxic T-cells, a type of lymphocyte that would otherwise eradicate the tumor; a process known as macrophage checkpoints. In animal models of several cancers, DCC-3014 has demonstrated potent macrophage checkpoint inhibition by blocking TAM-mediated immunosuppression as both a single agent and in combination with PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. TAMs are immunosuppressive and the greater the number in the tumor microenvironment, the lower the immune systems ability to attack the cancer. TAMs mediate their immunosuppressive function by decreasing the levels of the tumor-fighting CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. In the first figure below, control treatment with vehicle (placebo) results in a high TAM to CD8 T-cell ratio (black bar), indicative of high numbers of infiltrating TAMs that suppress the number of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells. This ratio is dramatically reversed (gray bar) after treatment with DCC-3014 to a tumor fighting state. In the second figure below, the ratio of the number of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells to the number of Treg cells is illustrated. Whereas CD8 T-cells are tumor fighting immune cells, Treg cells are immunosuppressive T-cells that, like TAMs, suppress the ability of the immune system to attack the cancer. Treatment with vehicle (placebo) results is a low ratio of CD8 T-cells to Treg cells, resulting in an immunosuppressed immune cell infiltration to the tumor site (black bar). Treatment with DCC-3014 reverses this 
 
28 


  ratio to an enhanced tumor fighting state illustrated by the higher ratio of tumor fighting CD8 T-cells to immunosuppressive Treg cells (gray bar). 
 


The following figure illustrates macrophage checkpoint inhibition by DCC-3014 in a syngeneic colorectal cancer model, which has a high influx of TAMs. In this experiment, we assessed the growth of murine colorectal cancer cells in mice treated with vehicle control, a control antibody, an anti-PD1 antibody, DCC-3014 or DCC-3014 in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody. The treatment period was 39 days. Tumor size was measured at 12 days after implantation and then every three or four days thereafter. The inhibiting effect of DCC-3014, dosed alone or in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody, was greater than that of vehicle control, control antibody or anti-PD1 antibody treatment alone. 
 


Unlike anti-CSF1R antibodies where over 10,000-fold increases in MCSF have been observed, DCC-3014 produces only a modest increase (less than 10-fold) in preclinical models potentially reducing the risk of rebound or other effects mediated by elevated MCSF. In addition, as an orally administered small molecule DCC-3014 offers significant flexibility in dose titration and a more convenient, patient-preferred route of administration compared to anti-CSF1R antibodies, which require injection. In January 2019 we announced positive, preliminary, top-line data from the ongoing dose escalation part of our Phase 1 study with DCC-3014 in patients with advanced malignancies. In addition, we announced a plan to expand the Phase 1 study to evaluate DCC-3014 in patients diagnosed with TGCT. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to study DCC-3014 in combination with other I/O therapies. We plan to present additional data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial at a medical meeting in 2019.

 Rebastinib: A Potent and Selective TIE2 Inhibitor 
 Rebastinib is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of the TIE2 immunokinase, the receptor for angiopoietins, an important family of vascular growth factors. Rebastinib binds potently into the switch pocket of TIE2, stabilizing the inhibitory switch and displacing the activation switch to block TIE2 signaling. TIE2 has an important role in regulating tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, metastasis, and immunotolerance in a manner analogous to CSF1R. Whereas CSF1R is expressed on TAMs in certain cancers, there is a different and distinct population of protumoral M2 macrophages in which TIE2 is active, known as TIE2 expressing macrophages, or TEMs. 
Ongoing Phase 1b/2 Studies of Rebastinib in Combination with Chemotherapy 
 Rebastinib is currently in clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors and in combination with chemotherapy in two company-sponsored Phase 1b/2 studies. 
 In October 2018, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, two-part Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 of this study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with paclitaxel, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. In part 2 of this study, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the RP2D of rebastinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel will be assessed across multiple cohorts, including: breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers. This study will enroll up to 36 evaluable patients in part 1 and up to 132 evaluable patients in part 2. 
 In January 2019, we announced that we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Part 1 (3+3 dose escalation) of this two-part study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 50 mg and 100 mg rebastinib BID when administered in combination with carboplatin, and to determine the RP2D of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. In part 2, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the RP2D of rebastinib in combination with carboplatin administered once every three weeks will be assessed across multiple disease cohorts, including: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and mesothelioma. This study is expected to enroll up to 117 patients in total, with approximately 18 patients in part 1 and up to 99 patients in part 2. 
Selectivity and Preclinical Profile of Rebastinib 
 We evaluated the selectively of rebastinib for TIE2 in a kinome screen assay. The kinome screen assay assesses the concentrations of rebastinib at which it inhibits TIE2 and other kinases. Rebastinib has greater than 100-fold selectively for TIE2. The following figure depicts the results of the kinome screen assay using a 10 micromolar concentration of ATP, a standard low concentration typically used in this assay. Each kinase in 
 
30 


  the assay is depicted as a point at the end of a branch in the figure, and each kinase inhibited by rebastinib is depicted as a red dot and listed in the legend to the figure. 
 


We evaluated the activity of rebastinib in a polyoma middle-T antigen, or PyMT, syngeneic mouse model in which murine breast cancer growth and metastasis can be assessed. In this model, tumor growth leads to metastasis, which is known to be modulated by TEMs. We examined multiple dosing schedules of rebastinib in combination with paclitaxel, an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics. In these preclinical studies, treatment with rebastinib significantly decreased tumor growth in the PyMT syngeneic mouse breast cancer model, reduced blood microvessel density and inhibited the TEMs. Treatment with rebastinib also significantly reduced the number of circulating tumor cells and metastases. 
 The figure below depicts the results of our evaluation of rebastinib in the PyMT syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. We treated the mice with vehicle, paclitaxel, rebastinib or a combination of rebastinib and paclitaxel. Tumor size was measured by weight at 31 days after initiation and every two or three days thereafter. 
 
31 


  Treatment with rebastinib, either alone or in combination with paclitaxel, controlled tumor growth to a greater extent than vehicle or paclitaxel alone. 
 


In addition to activity as a TIE2 inhibitor, a higher concentration of rebastinib also demonstrates activity as a switch control inhibitor of the kinases BCR-ABL1 and FLT3, which are believed to be involved in chronic or acute myeloid leukemia respectively. We investigated rebastinib in a Phase 1, single-agent trial in relapsed or refractory chronic (BCR-ABL+) or acute myeloid leukemia (FLT3-ITD+) patients. Although clinical activity was observed in this Phase 1 trial, clinical benefit was insufficient to justify continued development in either disease. However, PD analyses provided strong evidence of TIE2 inhibition in these patients. The primary objectives of this trial were to investigate the safety of rebastinib and establish the MTD. 57 patients received treatment with rebastinib. The trial established the MAD dose level as 200 mg BID and MTD as 150 mg BID. Dose limiting toxicities were dysarthria, or slurred or slow speech, muscle weakness, and peripheral neuropathy. Treatment emergent Grade 3 adverse events were reported by 35 patients (61%) and treatment emergent Grade 4 adverse events were reported by four patients (7%). One patient experienced an adverse event resulting in death, and the relationship to treatment is unknown. The most common adverse events (incidence of at least 30%) included dry mouth (47%), constipation (44%), fatigue (39%), muscular weakness (37%), headache (35%), nausea (33%) and dizziness (30%). Rebastinib exhibits 100-fold more potent inhibition of TIE2 compared to BCR-ABL in vitro. Our current clinical plans include exploring its potent TIE2 immunokinase inhibitory properties. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, biomarker data has demonstrated rebastinib-induced increases in the TIE2 ligand angiopoietin 2, secondary to TIE2 inhibition. 
 The figure below illustrates macrophage checkpoint inhibition by rebastinib in the PyMT syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. In this experiment, we assessed the growth of murine breast cancer cells in mice treated with vehicle control, a control antibody, an anti-PD1 antibody, rebastinib or rebastinib in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody. The treatment period was 18 days. Tumor size was measured at 11 days after implantation and then every three or four days thereafter. The inhibiting effect of rebastinib dosed in combination with an 
 
32 


  anti-PD1 antibody was greater than that of vehicle control, control antibody or anti-PD1 antibody or rebastinib treatment alone. 
 


Platform Development and Preclinical Pipeline 
 We intend to leverage our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform to advance additional drug candidates into clinical development. Our discovery programs are focused on novel immunokinases, kinases critical to autophagy and cancer cell metabolism, and kinases known to selectively drive cancer cell growth and survival. We are advancing the preclinical development of additional programs and expect to initiate further preclinical studies in one of these programs in 2019. 
Commercial Operations 
 For ripretinib, we intend to establish our own commercial and marketing organization in the United States and to selectively establish partnerships in markets outside the United States. We intend to build a specialist sales force to target physicians who are high prescribers of treatments for invasive solid tumors. We expect that the sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additionally, we expect that the sales and marketing teams will manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, physician group networks, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we expect to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to approval of ripretinib, which we may never obtain. 
 For our other drug candidates in oncology, we intend to retain commercialization rights in the United States and leverage our commercial and marketing organization for ripretinib, assuming we obtain regulatory approval in the United States. For certain drug candidates, such as DCC-3014 and rebastinib, we will consider entering into relationships with strategic partners that enable the expansion of the ongoing clinical development, while retaining significant value for our shareholders. These pharmaceutical company partnerships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales. 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for future 
 
33 


  commercial supply of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product from third-party manufacturers for ripretinib, DCC-3014 and rebastinib to support preclinical and clinical testing. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any long-term supply arrangements in place. Furthermore, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of drug substance and drug product. We do not currently have a validated manufacturing process or any commercial supply arrangements in place for ripretinib, both of which would be required to support our planned commercialization of ripretinib, if approved. 
 All of our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. As drug substances, they can be manufactured from readily available or custom synthesized starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are amenable to scale-up. Some, including ripretinib, may require specialized processing to optimize performance of the drug product. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future. 
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and other rare genetic diseases. There are other companies working to develop therapies in the field of kinase inhibition for cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 If we receive approval for the drug candidates in our priority programs for the indications we are targeting, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in clinical trials. 
 
34 


 Competition for Ripretinib 
 We are initially developing ripretinib for patients with GIST, ASM and other solid tumors with mutations in KIT and PDGFRα. 
 In GIST, the current approved standards of care for unresectable or metastatic patients are first-line imatinib, followed by second-line sunitinib upon imatinib progression, followed by third-line regorafenib upon sunitinib progression. If ripretinib receives marketing approval for GIST, we may also face competition from drug candidates in clinical trials including Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Blueprint Medicines Corporation, Plexxikon Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG and Xencor, Inc. 
 For ASM, the only approved drugs that inhibit KIT are imatinib for patients without the KIT D816V mutation or mutational status unknown and midostaurin (Novartis AG). If ripretinib receives marketing approval, in addition to midostaurin it may face competition from other drug candidates in clinical trials for ASM, including drug candidates from AB Science S.A., Allakos Inc., Blueprint Medicines Corporation, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Plexxikon Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited. 
 Competition for Rebastinib 
 We are initially developing rebastinib, a TIE2 inhibitor, to control immunosuppressive TAMs expressing TIE2 to assist the immune system in targeting tumor cells. While rebastinib is a novel molecule, we may face competition from drug candidates in clinical trials that are not TIE2 inhibitors, but aim to achieve similar effects on the immune system. These include small molecule drug candidates in clinical trials from Array BioPharma Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novartis AG, Plexxikon Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, and from antibody therapeutics from Amgen Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Holding Ltd, Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Competition for DCC-3014
We are initially developing DCC-3014, an inhibitor of CSF1R, to control immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages to assist the immune system in targeting tumor cells. If DCC-3014 receives marketing approval, it may face competition from other drug candidates in clinical trials that target CSF1R, including small molecule drug candidates in clinical trials from Array BioPharma, Inc., Novartis AG, Plexxikon Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, and from antibody therapeutics including those from Amgen Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Holding Ltd, Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates, for example, ripretinib, DCC-3014 and rebastinib, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform. 
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. 
 
35 


 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 With regard to ripretinib, as of February 28, 2019, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The first issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2027, and two issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we own related patents and pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, South America and Asia that will also expire in 2032. We also own three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications directed to methods of using ripretinib, which if granted, will have expiration dates between 2037 and 2039. 
 With regard to DCC-3014, as of February 28, 2019, we own one issued U.S. patent with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2034. In addition, we own related patents and pending applications in Europe, Asia, and Australia that are expected to expire in 2034. We also own one pending U.S. provisional patent application, which, if an application issues claiming priority to this provisional, would expire in 2040. 
 With regard to rebastinib, as of February 28, 2019, we own three issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in between 2027 and 2034. In addition, we own related issued patents in Australia, Canada, Asia, and Europe which are expected to expire in 2027 and pending patent applications in certain jurisdictions that if issued will expire between 2027 and 2034. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
 In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering ripretinib, DCC-3014, and rebastinib may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved drug candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, our proprietary kinase switch control inhibitor platform and certain aspects of our manufacturing processes and aspects of our kinase switch control platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, such individuals may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including 
 
36 


  our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the regulatory authoritys refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, debarment, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 U.S. Drug Development 
 In the United States, FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

 | completion of extensive preclinical, sometimes referred to as nonclinical, laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | a determination by FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug product are produced to assess compliance with FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements, or cGMP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
37 


 
 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: preclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the preclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on patient safety and the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. FDA also may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. Phase 1 trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effects, tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidates efficacy and safety such that it can serve as the primary basis for approval of the drug. 
 
38 


  Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any finding from other clinical studies, tests in laboratory animals, or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA Review Process 
 Following trial completion, trial data are analyzed to assess safety and efficacy. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the drug and information about the manufacturing process and facilities that will be used to ensure drug quality, results of analytical testing conducted on the chemistry of the drug, and other relevant information. The NDA is a request for approval to market the drug and must contain adequate evidence of safety and efficacy, which is demonstrated by extensive preclinical and clinical testing. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a use of a drug, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product for a particular indication or indications to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to FDAs fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an original NDA, is $2,588,478. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($309,915). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 
39 


 Within 60 days following submission of an original NDA, FDA reviews the application to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, including for failure to pay required fees, and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing. FDA typically makes a decision on whether to accept an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the NDA. Under the performance goals established under PDUFA, FDA has agreed to review 90% of standard NDAs for new molecular entities (NMEs) in ten months from the filing date and 90% of priority NME NDAs in six months from the filing date. The goals for reviewing standard and priority non-NME NDAs are ten months and six months, respectively, measured from the 60-day filing date of the application. FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA may refer applications for novel drugs or drug candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. In the course of its review, FDA may re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all. 
 Before approving an NDA, FDA typically conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new drug to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, challenge the determination set forth in the letter by requesting a hearing, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 There is no assurance that FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient subgroups, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse events be included in the drug labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and 
 
40 


  surveillance to monitor the effects of approved drugs. For example, FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drugs safety and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved drugs that have been commercialized. FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs. Drug approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a Fast Track Designation, FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. 
 FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs intended to treat serious conditions that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten-month review periods are measured from the filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track Designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint and to submit promotional materials for preapproval and pre-use review. In addition, the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 Moreover, a sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 
41 


 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric Trials 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 
 A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug subject to PREA must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company and the approved drug are subject to continuing regulation by FDA, including, among other things, establishment registration and drug listing, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drugs approved labeling (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses. FDA takes the position that manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the drug or its labeling or changes of the site or process of manufacture are often subject to the approval of FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. 
 In the United States, once a drug is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by FDA. FDA regulations require that drugs be manufactured in specific facilities per the NDA approval and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drugs in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from 
 
42 


  cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute drugs manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a drug after approval may result in restrictions on a drug, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the drug from the market, and may require substantial resources to correct. 
 FDA also may require post-approval testing, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and post-marketing surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved drug or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the drug. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drugs approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our drugs under development. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or ACA. If drugs are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In addition, our leasing and operation of real property may subject us to liability pursuant to certain U.S. environmental laws and regulations, under which current or previous owners or operators of real property and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for the cost of investigating or remediating contamination caused by hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. 
 
43 


 The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, voluntary recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting 
 
44 


  a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants Orphan Drug Designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. 
 In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
 In the European Union, Orphan Drug Designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the Orphan Drug Designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Regulation of Diagnostic Tests 
 Some of our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval application, or PMA, approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway. 
 
45 


 PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to FDAs satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 On August 6, 2014, FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices. According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under FDAs Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 In the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. 
 European Drug Development 
 In Europe, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the 
 
46 


  European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) once the EU Portal and Database are fully functional. It is expected that the Regulation will apply in 2019. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an opt-out from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. 
 European Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 
 The first is the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

 European Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In Europe, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the Europe and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurers and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products in which our products are used. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. 
 In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs or biological products exists, and one payors determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement limitations to a substantial degree, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process may be a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. 
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price 
 
48 


  controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates owed are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, while all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. These Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of childrens hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. However, on December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a recent reimbursement formula change instituted by CMS under the 340B program. For the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, CMS altered the reimbursement formula from Average Sale Price (ASP) plus 6% to ASP 
 
49 


  minus 22.5% on specified covered outpatient drugs (SCODs). The court ruled this change was not an adjustment which was within the Secretarys discretion to make, but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation, and such a dramatic change was beyond the scope of the Secretarys authority. The court has not determined whether reimbursement rates should be retroactively returned to the ASP plus 6% rate and the difference in such reimbursement made to the covered facilities, or if some other remedy is more appropriate. It is unclear how the invalidation of the formula could affect pharmaceutical manufacturers and hospitals who prescribe their products. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitors drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 
 In recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including: 
 

 | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of 
 
50 


  direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform 
 The ACA has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to reform through legislation and Executive Orders of the President, and to judicial challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the individual mandate. However, the new presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority, and has discussed repealing and replacing or amending the ACA. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and its possible repeal and replacement could have on our business. 
 On January 20, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. In December 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable 
 
51 


  Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. In addition, CMS has recently published regulations that would give states greater flexibility starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills this year designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the ACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. 
 The full impact of the ACA, any law repealing or replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administrations budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a Blueprint, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Moreover, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.

 Other Healthcare Laws 
 For our product and any product candidates that obtain regulatory approval and are marketed in the United States, our arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers, and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to health information privacy and security regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below: 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party on its behalf) to, knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, receive, or pay remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual for or the purchase or recommendation of an item or for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of this law carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, administrative civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil penalties, and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates, relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
53 


 
of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damage or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from one another in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a companys attention from the business. 
 If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. 
 European Data Collection 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and 
 
54 


  GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 Employees 
 We have operated by leveraging skilled experts, consultants, contract research organizations, and contractors to manage our clinical operations, under the leadership and direction of our management. We will expand our infrastructure to manage our clinical, finance and commercial operations with additional full-time employees. 
 As of February 28, 2019, we had 112 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, 40 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these employees, 88 were engaged in research and development activities and 26 were engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
