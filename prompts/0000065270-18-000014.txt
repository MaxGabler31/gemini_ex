Item 1.  Business

Methode Electronics, Inc. was incorporated in 1946 as an Illinois corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966.  As used herein, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Methode” means Methode Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing, design and testing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Mexico, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our primary manufacturing facilities are located in Shanghai, China; Cairo, Egypt; Mriehel, Malta; Monterrey and Fresnillo, Mexico; and Nelson, British Columbia, Canada. We design, manufacture and market devices employing electrical, radio remote control, electronic, wireless, sensing and optical technologies.  Our corporate headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois. Our components are found in the primary end-markets of the aerospace, appliance, automotive, construction, consumer and industrial equipment, communications (including information processing and storage, networking equipment and wireless and terrestrial voice/data systems), medical, rail and other transportation industries.

We maintain our financial records on the basis of a fifty-two or fifty-three week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. Fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 all represented fifty-two weeks of results.

Segments.  Our business is managed, and our financial results are reported, on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Interface, Power Products and Other.

The Automotive segment supplies electronic and electro-mechanical devices and related products to automobile original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), either directly or through their tiered suppliers. Our products include integrated center consoles, hidden switches, ergonomic switches, transmission lead-frames, light-emitting diode ("LED") based lighting and sensors, which incorporate magneto-elastic sensing and other technologies that monitor the operation or status of a component or system.

The Interface segment provides a variety of copper and fiber-optic interface and interface solutions for the aerospace, appliance, commercial food service, construction, consumer, material handling, medical, military, mining, point-of-sale and telecommunications markets.  Solutions include conductive polymers, industrial safety radio remote controls, optical and copper transceivers and solid-state field-effect consumer touch panels.  Services include the design and installation of fiber-optic and copper infrastructure systems and manufacturing active and passive optical components. Through fiscal 2018, the interface segment included our Methode Development Company business, which provided conductive ink products for the automotive market. The business was shuttered at the end of fiscal 2018 due to a management-driven strategic change in direction. Through fiscal 2017, the Interface segment included our Connectivity business, which provided solutions for computer and networking markets, including connectors and custom cable assemblies. This business was shuttered at the end of fiscal 2017 due to market conditions.

The Power Products segment manufactures braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated busbars and devices, custom power-product assemblies, such as our PowerRail® solution, high-current low-voltage flexible power cabling systems and powder-coated busbars that are used in various markets and applications, including aerospace, computers, industrial, power conversion, military, telecommunications and transportation.

The Other segment is primarily made up of our medical device business, Dabir Surfaces, our surface support technology aimed at pressure injury prevention. Methode is developing the technology for use by patients who are immobilized or otherwise at risk for pressure injuries, including patients undergoing long-duration surgical procedures. Through fiscal 2017, the Other segment included our Active Energy Solutions business, which provided inverters, battery systems and insulated-gate bipolar transistor solutions. Due to market conditions, this business was shuttered at the end of fiscal 2017.
Financial results by segment are summarized in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

Sales.  The following table reflects the percentage of net sales of the segments of the Company for the last three fiscal years.

 | Year Ended 
 | April 28, 2018 | | April 29, 2017 | | April 30, 2016
Automotive | 80.3 | % | | 77.5 | % | 76.0 | %
Interface | 12.7 | % | | 15.6 | % | 17.4 | %
Power Products | 7.0 | % | | 6.9 | % | 6.6 | %
Other | — | % | | — | % | — | %


The majority of our sales activities are directed by sales managers who are supported by field application engineers and other engineering personnel who work with customers to design our products into their systems.  Our field application engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products.  Our products are sold through in-house sales staff and independent manufacturers’ representatives with offices throughout the world.  Information about our sales and operations in different geographic regions is summarized in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.  Sales are made primarily to OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers, as well as to selling partners and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Materials.  The principal materials that we purchase include application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, LED displays, plastic molding materials, precious metals, and silicon die castings.  All of these items are available from several suppliers and we generally rely on more than one supplier for each item. We normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. In fiscal 2018, the Company experienced increased costs for copper. We did not experience any significant price increases in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016. We experienced some lower costs for certain commodities, primarily the cost of resin-based products, in fiscal 2016.

Patents.  The Company has been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and has additional domestic and international patent applications pending related to our products and manufacturing processes. The Company's existing patents expire on various dates from 2018 to 2036. The Company seeks patents in order to protect the Company's interest in certain products and technologies, including our TouchSensor, magnetic torque sensing, medical devices and high-power distribution products. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.

Seasonality.  A significant portion of our business is dependent upon the automotive sales and vehicle production schedules of our customers.  The automotive market is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, interest rates, fuel prices and consumer spending patterns. 

Material Customers.  During the fiscal year ended April 28, 2018, shipments to General Motors Corporation (“GM”) and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”), or their tiered suppliers, represented 43.3% and 12.3%, respectively, of consolidated net sales.  In general, these sales were for component parts used in particular vehicle models of the OEMs. Typically, our Ford and GM supply arrangements for each component part include a blanket purchase order and production releases. In general, a blanket purchase order is issued for each Ford or GM part as identified by the customer part number. Each such Ford or GM blanket purchase order accounted for less than 10.0% of our fiscal 2018 consolidated net sales. Each blanket purchase order includes standard terms and conditions, including price. In certain circumstances, we supply Ford or GM the requirements for a particular customer vehicle model for the life of the model, which can vary from three to seven years. Both Ford and GM order parts using production releases approved under the relevant blanket purchase order. The production releases are submitted by the various Ford or GM plants and include information regarding part quantities and delivery specifications.
Backlog. Our backlog of orders was approximately $249.2 million on April 28, 2018, and $203.2 million on April 29, 2017.  We expect that most of the backlog at April 28, 2018 will be shipped within fiscal 2019.

Competitive Conditions.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments.  We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas; many of these competitors have greater resources and sales.  Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products.

Research and Development.  We maintain a research and development program involving a number of professional employees who devote a majority of their time to the enhancement of existing products and to the development of new products and processes.  Research and development costs primarily relate to product engineering and design and development expenses

and are classified as a component of our costs of goods sold on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Expenditures for such activities amounted to $37.9 million for fiscal 2018 and $27.8 million for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.

Environmental Matters.  Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.  Currently, we do not have any material environmental-related lawsuits or material administrative proceedings pending against us.  Further information as to environmental matters affecting us is presented in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.

Employees.  At April 28, 2018 and April 29, 2017, we had 5,056 and 4,464 employees, respectively.  We also, from time to time, employ part-time employees and hire independent contractors.  Our employees from our Malta and Mexico facilities, which account for approximately 60% of our total number of employees, are represented by collective bargaining agreements.  We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our employee relations are good.
