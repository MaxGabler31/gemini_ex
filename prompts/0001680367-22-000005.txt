Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are an innovative clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of dual-sided fusion proteins as an entirely new class of biologic medicine. We have created a novel approach to immune modulation by designing biologics with structural characteristics that are not achievable by existing therapeutic modalities, including monoclonal or bispecific antibodies. Compounds derived from our proprietary Agonist Redirected Checkpoint, or ARC, platform simultaneously inhibit checkpoint molecules and activate costimulatory molecules within a single therapeutic.
Our lead product candidate, SL-172154, is designed to simultaneously inhibit the CD47/SIRPα macrophage checkpoint interaction and activate the CD40 costimulatory receptor to induce an antitumor immune response. Coupling CD40 activation with CD47 inhibition differentiates SL-172154 from all other clinical-stage CD47/SIRPα inhibitors in development, and in our published preclinical studies, SL-172154 resulted in superior antitumor immunity as compared to certain CD47/SIRPα inhibitors. We are pursuing a broad clinical development strategy in both hematologic and solid tumors, with multiple ongoing clinical trials. SL-172154 is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. In addition to our clinical trials in solid tumors, we are also evaluating SL-172154 in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with certain hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or HR-MDS. We believe our clinical development plan will provide both first-in-class and best-in-class development opportunities for SL-172154.
Our second product candidate, SL-279252, is designed to simultaneously inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activate the OX40 costimulatory receptor and is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
In November 2021, at the 36th annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or the SITC Meeting, we announced initial clinical data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials for SL-172154 in ovarian cancer and for SL-279252 in advanced solid tumors and lymphoma. We believe that these data generated in human cancer patients have demonstrated that the unique protein engineering and physical properties of the ARC platform have led to a differentiated profile in terms of safety and on-target immune activation as compared to monoclonal or bispecific antibodies. 
In addition to our clinical-stage ARC product candidates, we possess a deep pipeline of preclinical immuno-oncology candidates. As an example, SL-9258, an ARC in preclinical development, is designed to inhibit the TIGIT/PVR checkpoint interaction while simultaneously activating HVEM and LTβ costimulatory receptors. 
Furthermore, our expertise in dual-sided fusion proteins has led to the development of a second novel platform technology. We call this our gamma delta T cell engager, or GADLEN, platform. 
We plan to nominate a third clinical product candidate from our preclinical pipeline in 2022. Longer-term, we are pursuing additional disease areas, including autoimmune diseases, where our dual-sided fusion protein platforms may provide advantages over current treatment modalities. 
Our Pipeline 
Our lead product candidate, SL-172154, is designed to simultaneously inhibit the CD47/SIRPα macrophage checkpoint interaction and activate the CD40 costimulatory receptor to induce an antitumor immune response. Coupling the costimulatory effect of CD40 activation with CD47 inhibition differentiates SL-172154 from other CD47/SIRPα inhibitors in clinical development. In clinical studies, we believe that SL-172154 has further differentiated from other CD47/SIRPα inhibitors both in terms of safety and tolerability, and has demonstrated evidence of potent CD40 activation in human cancer patients.
We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating SL-172154 in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In November 2021, at the SITC Meeting, we announced initial data from 15 patients in the first four dose-escalation cohorts from the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of this trial. These data demonstrated that SL-172154 was well tolerated through 3 mg/kg, with no treatment-related grade 3 or greater adverse events. Near-complete target occupancy on leukocytes was observed for both CD47 and CD40 at 3 mg/kg. We also observed pharmacodynamic activity, including dose-dependent margination of CD40 expressing leukocytes from the peripheral blood and dose-dependent increases in cytokines, such as IL-12, that are associated with antitumor immunity. Monotherapy dose escalation is ongoing. We plan to initiate combination clinical trials in parallel due to the observation of monotherapy immunologic activity across the current dose range. We plan to initiate a Phase 1B clinical trial evaluating SL-172154 in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian 
cancer in 2022. We expect to announce additional data from the ongoing Phase 1A monotherapy dose-escalation trial and initial data from the Phase 1B combination trial in the first half of 2023. 
We have conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, to evaluate the intratumoral administration of SL-172154. We expect to announce data from this trial in the first half of 2022. 
In addition to evaluating SL-172154 in solid tumors, we have expanded our evaluation of SL-172154 to include hematologic malignancies. We are conducting a Phase 1A/B clinical trial in patients with AML and HR-MDS, wherein patients will be enrolled into either a monotherapy Phase 1A or combination Phase 1B cohort in a staggered parallel design. In AML, we intend to study SL-172154 in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. In HR-MDS and TP53 mutant AML, we intend to study SL-172154 in combination with azacitidine. We expect to announce initial data from this Phase 1A/B trial in the first half of 2023.
We also intend to continue to assess other drug combination opportunities for SL-172154 in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, as well as hematologic malignancies.
Our second product candidate, SL-279252, is designed to simultaneously inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and activate the OX40 receptor. We are evaluating SL-279252 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. In November 2021, at the SITC Meeting, we announced initial data from 43 patients from the first ten dose levels of this clinical trial. These data demonstrated initial monotherapy antitumor activity in patients who previously failed checkpoint inhibitors, at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. Data through 6 mg/kg demonstrated that SL-279252 was well tolerated, and we observed pharmacodynamic activity, including dose-dependent margination of OX40+ lymphocytes from the peripheral blood. We are currently dosing at 12 mg/kg and plan to continue dose escalation to 24 mg/kg. We expect to announce additional data from this clinical trial in the second half of 2022. 
We are leveraging our proprietary ARC and GADLEN platforms to discover and develop dual-sided, bi-functional fusion protein product candidates. We own, or have exclusively licensed, the intellectual property rights to our product candidates.
The following table highlights our clinical-stage product candidates:
In addition to our clinical-stage ARC product candidates, we possess a deep pipeline of preclinical immuno-oncology candidates. As an example, SL-9258 is designed to inhibit the interaction between TIGIT and its known ligands, including PVR, PVRL2, PVRL3, and NECTIN-4, while simultaneously activating HVEM and LTβ receptors with two preformed LIGHT trimers. With the addition of HVEM and LTβ receptor activation, we believe this compound is a highly differentiated TIGIT inhibitor. Utilizing a proprietary animal model of PD-1 acquired resistance, SL-9258 demonstrated differentiation from antibody-mediated TIGIT blockade in its ability to overcome checkpoint inhibitor acquired resistance.
The following table highlights the preclinical programs from which we may select our next clinical candidates:
Our ARC Platform
Our proprietary ARC platform has the potential to create therapeutics that can dramatically change the way we treat cancer and other diseases. We developed the ARC platform to address the need for a single therapeutic that consolidates multiple immune functions. Compounds developed from our ARC platform simultaneously block immune checkpoint receptors and activate costimulatory molecules in the tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, superfamily.
The functional domains of ARC compounds are derived from native human proteins, rather than antibody binding domains. This enables the rapid generation of new constructs, given that the starting template for distinct ARC compounds is the human genome. Therefore, an ARC compound can be taken from the conception stage to a manufactured purified protein in approximately six weeks, whereas it can take approximately six months to reach the same stage for an antibody therapeutic candidate. This rapid reduction in discovery processing time, has allowed us to generate more than 400 unique, dual-sided fusion proteins.
Structure of an ARC Compound 
Our proprietary ARC platform is designed to overcome the limitations of existing bivalent antibodies. ARC compounds consolidate checkpoint blockade and immune costimulation within a single therapeutic. Additionally, ARC compounds possess a structure that matches the native structure of the target receptors and colocalizes both mechanisms of activity within the immune synapse to promote a coordinated immune response. We designed the ARC platform as a modular scaffold wherein three principal components are fused together, comprising a human Type 1 extracellular domain protein, an optimized, proprietary Fc domain, and a human Type 2 extracellular domain protein. As shown in Figure 1 below, one end of the ARC compound consists of a checkpoint receptor domain and the opposite end consists of a TNF ligand domain, connected by an optimized, proprietary scaffold such as an Fc domain. We designed ARC compounds to self-assemble into a hexameric structure, as shown in Figure 1 below, comprising six distinct checkpoint receptor domains and six distinct TNF ligand domains, which importantly form two trimerized costimulatory ligand domains.
Figure 1—Structural Properties of ARC Compounds
The unique dual-sided structure of our ARC compounds allows us to simultaneously and effectively target a wide array of pathways for the creation of a deep and differentiated product pipeline. We utilize our understanding of disease pathology and immune dysfunction to identify pairings of optimal domains. Initially, our efforts are concentrated on three broad target families: immune checkpoints, TNF superfamily costimulatory receptors, and cytokines.
We believe that the following features represent the key advantages offered by compounds developed with the ARC platform:
•Matching native structure of TNF receptors 
•Target specificity, high affinity, and high avidity 
•Replacing tumor immune evasion with potent immune stimulation 
•Versatility 
•Speed from concept to compound to clinic 
•Accelerated lead selection process 
We believe these collective advantages create the potential for the capital-efficient identification and pursuit of differentiated product candidates.
While many TNF receptor agonist antibodies have been developed and tested in human clinical trials, most have been discontinued prior to pivotal studies due to toxicity. As shown in Panel A of Figure 2 below, activation of TNF receptors, such as CD40, and downstream signaling requires the assembly of three receptor molecules, or trimerization. As shown in Panel B of Figure 2 below, there is a structural mismatch between bivalent antibody therapeutics and trimeric TNF receptors. Traditional bivalent antibodies can only bind to two TNF receptors and are thus unable to individually trimerize a TNF receptor, leading to weak signaling of TNF pathways. For TNF receptor agonist antibodies to trimerize a TNF receptor, multiple antibodies must be cross-linked through Fc receptors located on accessory cells. This mechanism becomes less effective at increasing antibody doses due to saturation of TNF receptors and Fc receptors independently of each other. Consequently, there is no free Fc receptor available to cross-link the TNF receptor bound antibody. This effect manifests in clinical trials as an atypical dose-response relationship, known as a “bell-shaped” dose-response curve, wherein any signs of immune activation initially increase with dose but then subsequently decrease at higher doses. As shown in Panel C of Figure 2, ARCs are designed to self-assemble into two sets of TNF trimers, which induces trimerization of TNF receptor targets and drives a costimulatory signal.
Figure 2—Antibody Therapies Lead to Inefficient TNF Pathway Activation
Versatility of the Platform
The modularity of our dual-sided fusion protein platforms, including our ARC platform, facilitates a vast repertoire of potential dual-sided fusion proteins that can be synthesized and developed. In the human genome, there are more than 1,400 Type 1 membrane proteins, which are characterized by an extracellular amino terminal domain, and more than 450 Type 2 membrane proteins, which are characterized by an extracellular carboxy terminal domain. ARC compounds are assembled from any combination of Type 1 and Type 2 membrane proteins and, therefore, have significant diversity, with more than 630,000 possible combinations. Within this vast set of possible combinations, we have chosen to focus initially on three classes of targets that have already shown significant clinical relevance for the treatment of cancer comprising immune checkpoints, the TNF superfamily, and cytokines. We utilize our understanding of disease pathology and immune dysfunction to identify pairings of optimal targets within a single therapeutic.
Our Strategy 
Our goal is to become the world leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of dual-sided, bi-functional fusion proteins for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. We plan to achieve this by utilizing our proprietary ARC and GADLEN platforms to create novel therapeutics to treat patients who lack effective treatment options. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Rapidly advancing our clinical-stage ARC product candidates, SL-172154 and SL-279252, through clinical development and marketing approval
•Leveraging our ARC and GADLEN platforms to rapidly advance additional product candidates into clinical development 
•Continuing to augment our fusion protein manufacturing capabilities 
•Collaborating with leading biopharmaceutical companies 
•Building on our culture of R&D excellence and continuing to out-innovate ourselves
•Deepening our intellectual property portfolio to continue to protect our platform technologies and product candidates 
Our ARC Product Candidates 
SL-172154: A Dual CD47/SIRPα Blocking and CD40-Activating ARC Compound 
Clinical Data to Date 
In November 2021, at the SITC Meeting, we presented data from the dose-escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1A trial of SL-172154 as monotherapy in heavily pretreated platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. As of a September 15, 2021 data cutoff, we had enrolled a total of 15 patients across four dose levels ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. Dose escalation was conducted according to the Modified Toxicity Probability Interval-2 trial design. Patients received SL-172154 on either a weekly schedule or, after doses on day one, day eight, and day 15, a bi-weekly schedule. The patients treated as of September 15, 2021 were heavily pretreated with a median of five prior lines of systemic therapies. 
SL-172154 has been generally well tolerated. Specifically, we did not observe dose-limiting hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia or other cytopenias (toxicities which have limited the development of some CD47 inhibitors) through the 3 mg/kg dose level. We believe that SL-172154 may have a differentiated safety profile, which may be due to the lack of an Fc gamma receptor binding Fc domain.
We have observed high levels of target occupancy of SL-172154 on both CD47 and CD40 through 3 mg/kg. As shown in Figure 3, we observed preferential binding of SL-172154 to CD47+ leukocytes compared to red blood cells. Binding to leukocytes approached near-full CD47 target occupancy at doses of 1 mg/kg or greater. 
Figure 3—CD47 Targets Occupancy of SL-172154 on White Blood Cells and Red Blood Cells
We have also observed unique pharmacodynamic effects consistent with on-target CD40 activation. Immediately post-infusion of SL-172154, a rapid, dose-dependent margination of CD40+ B cells and monocytes from the circulation was observed, as shown in Panel A and Panel B of Figure 4. We also observed an increase in B cell activation markers CD86 and CD95 following each infusion of SL-172154, as shown in Panel C of Figure 4. Additionally, increases in on-target cytokines such as IL-12, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL22 have been observed following each infusion of SL-172154. No evidence of a bell-shaped dose response curve was observed through 3 mg/kg, a dose at which high levels of CD40 target occupancy were observed. 
 Figure 4—CD40 Activation of SL-172154 with Dose-Dependent Margination and Activation B Cells
In paired biopsies collected from our ongoing clinical trials, we have observed increases in CD68+ macrophages as well as both CD40 and MHC Class II activation markers in the tumor microenvironment, consistent with induction of an innate immune response. Additionally, we have seen an increase in PD-L1 expression by the combined positive score, suggesting that the increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells induced a local interferon response. We have also observed increases in Ki67+ CD8 T cells and the Granzyme B+ CD8 T cells. These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism of action of SL-172154: simultaneous CD47 inhibition and CD40 activation bridging an innate to adaptive immune response. 
As of October 7, 2021, 14 of the 15 patients treated with SL-172154 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer had a post-baseline scan at eight weeks and were evaluable for efficacy. Four patients had stable disease as best response including one patient with stable disease of 16 weeks or greater at 0.3 mg/kg and nine had progressive disease. We are continuing monotherapy dose escalation at the next dose level of 10 mg/kg.
Clinical Development Strategy
We believe that SL-172154 is a highly differentiated CD47 inhibitor with potential for both best-in-class and first-in-class development opportunities. We are conducting Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating the administration of SL-172154 in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. As a class, CD47 inhibitors are being developed in combination with other agents that potentiate phagocytosis and initiate an immune response, such as chemotherapy, ADCP-competent antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, and others.
Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer expresses the highest levels of CD47 of any solid tumor and is a tumor type with a significant infiltration of macrophages, which express CD40. We believe this makes ovarian cancer particularly well-suited to the investigation of SL-172154. We are conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of SL-172154 administered intravenously in patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, collectively referred to as ovarian cancer. Patients that are eligible for this trial have relapsed after standard-of-care therapies and are ineligible for further platinum-based therapies. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of SL-172154. The secondary objectives include evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and the antitumor activity of SL-172154.
In the ongoing Phase 1A monotherapy dose-escalation trial, three or more patients will be enrolled through each of the dose levels until a maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose is defined. In parallel, we plan to evaluate SL-172154 in a Phase 1B combination dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in combination with liposomal doxorubicin. Liposomal doxorubicin is a standard-of-care chemotherapy for this patient population. According to the literature and our internally generated data, liposomal doxorubicin upregulates calreticulin, an endogenous “eat me” signal, on the surface of tumor cells. We believe that liposomal doxorubicin is an attractive combination partner due to the observed upregulation of calreticulin, which led to potentiation of SL-172154-mediated ovarian cancer cell phagocytosis in in vitro studies. Furthermore, because the overall response rate of this patient population to liposomal doxorubicin is approximately 10%, there is significant opportunity for improved response rates in combination with SL-172154, wherein we believe the contribution of SL-172154 will be discernible. We are evaluating additional combination opportunities in ovarian cancer.
We expect to announce additional data from the ongoing Phase 1A monotherapy dose-escalation trial and initial data from the Phase 1B combination trial in the first half of 2023.
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
We conducted a Phase 1 trial of SL-172154 administered intratumorally in patients with locally advanced or metastatic CSCC and HNSCC not amenable to further treatment with surgery, radiation, or standard systemic therapies. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of SL-172154. The secondary objectives included evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and the antitumor activity of SL-172154.
Based on the totality of the safety and biomarker data collected to date in our ongoing Phase 1A clinical trial in ovarian cancer patients, we have decided to focus development of SL-172154 as an intravenously administered product candidate. Thus, as of February 24 2022, we ceased enrollment and are in the process of closing this trial. In addition, we experienced enrollment and operational challenges associated with intratumoral administration trials (which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic), further supporting the decision to pursue a registrational strategy via intravenous administration. Overall, SL-172514 was well tolerated in this trial; we did not observe dose-limiting toxicities and did not reach a maximum tolerated dose. We expect to announce data from this trial in the first half of 2022. We may continue further development in HNSCC and/or CSCC in an intravenous administration trial of SL-172154 following selection of a recommended Phase 2 dose in our ovarian cancer trial.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
We are conducting a Phase 1A/B clinical trial for SL-172154 in patients with AML and HR-MDS. This ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154, as both monotherapy and in combination. In AML, we plan to evaluate SL-172154 in combination with both azacitidine and venetoclax. In both HR-MDS and TP53 mutant AML, we plan to evaluate SL-172154 in combination with azacitidine.
We have initiated the monotherapy Phase 1A dose escalation portion of this trial. We plan to conduct the Phase 1B dose escalation portion of this trial of SL-172154 in combination with azacitidine in a parallel staggered manner. Monotherapy dose-escalation and initial dose-escalation combination cohorts are anticipated to be in a heavily pretreated, predominantly refractory patient population. Once a recommended dose and schedule have been determined in combination with azacitidine, we plan to enroll patients in expansion cohorts in combination with azacitidine, with or without venetoclax, depending on the indication. As a class, CD47 inhibitors have demonstrated clinical activity in both AML and HR-MDS. We see an opportunity for 
SL-172154 to continue to differentiate from other compounds in the field due to the combined effects of CD47 blockade and CD40 costimulation. Specifically, we believe that our preclinical and initial clinical data from our ongoing Phase 1A clinical trial in ovarian cancer indicate that SL-172154 may differentiate from other CD47/SIRPα inhibitors in one or more of the following ways:
•Improved overall response rate due to CD40-mediated activation of both innate and adaptive immunity
•Improved response durability due to enhanced CD40-mediated activation of adaptive immunity
•Differentiated safety profile due to the absence of dose-limiting anemia or thrombocytopenia
We expect to announce initial combination data from this trial in the first half of 2023.
To date, we have experienced delays in our clinical trials of SL-172154 because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we have experienced: delays with certain third-party vendors supporting this trial, including third-party manufacturers; difficulty procuring sufficient quantities of raw materials required for our manufacturing processes; delays as a result of some patients choosing to forego one or more doses in our clinical trials; and staffing shortages at many clinical trial sites. We expect to continue to experience some or all of these delays in the future. 
Preclinical Experience 
Our lead product candidate, SL-172154, simultaneously inhibits CD47 and activates the CD40 receptor. The pairing of a CD40 agonist domain to a CD47 inhibitory domain was selected based on prior publications which demonstrated that tumor rejection in the setting of CD47 inhibition was dependent upon a T cell mediated adaptive immune response. Agents which only block the interaction between CD47 and SIRPα do not directly activate T cell mediated adaptive immunity, but instead function to enable macrophage mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells. Antigen presenting cells, including macrophages, express CD40. Stimulation of CD40 on antigen presenting cells is known to improve the efficiency of antigen presentation and activation of T cell mediated adaptive immunity, including antitumor immunity.
To date, we have conducted extensive preclinical studies of SL-172154 that have demonstrated the following:
•Specific binding to CD47 and CD40 with high picomolar affinity
•A significant increase in macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells
•Durable receptor occupancy to CD47 expressing cells
•Dose-dependent CD40-mediated pharmacodynamic activity
•The activation of antigen presenting cells by a CD40-induced type I interferon response
•Dose-dependent increases in multiple anti-cancer cytokines in both non-human primates and by human lymphocytes
•Dose-dependent activation of a CD8+ T cell response, which was responsible for tumor cell killing
•Superior tumor rejection as compared to CD47 inhibitory antibodies, CD40 agonist antibodies, or the combination thereof, in mouse tumor models
Taken together, we believe these data demonstrate the potential ability of SL-172154 to activate and bridge the adaptive and innate immune responses.
We performed standard in vitro tumor cell phagocytosis assays to demonstrate whether SL-172154 enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of various tumor cell lines, both alone and in combination with tumor-targeted ADCP-competent antibodies. As shown in Figure 5 below, consistent with the mechanism of action of CD47 blocking agents, SL-172154 significantly enhanced the ability of macrophages to phagocytose tumor cells in the presence of tumor-targeted ADCP-competent antibodies. Additionally, SL-172154 potentiated macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells that expressed calreticulin, a well-established “eat me” signal expressed on the surface of cells marked for phagocytosis.
Figure 5—Tumor Phagocytosis Activity of SIRPα-Fc-CD40L with or without ADCP-competent Antibodies
Human monocyte derived macrophages were co-cultured with HCC1954, A431, HCC827, or Caov-3 cells in the presence of an IgG negative control, SL-172154, an ADCP-competent tumor-targeted antibody, including Trastuzumab or Cetuximab, or the combination of SL-172154 and the ADCP-competent tumor-targeted antibody. After two hours, the proportion of tumor cells phagocytosed by human macrophages was determined and reported as the phagocytosis index.
We conducted dose-range finding and repeat dose toxicity studies in nonhuman primates, or NHP, to evaluate the safety and pharmacologic effects of SL-172154. In these studies, SL-172154 was administered as five once-weekly doses across a dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg, followed by a recovery period. Data from these studies indicated that SL-172154 induced a potent immune response in NHP. Figure 6 below shows dose-dependent saturation of CD47+ red blood cells, which was durable for greater than seven days. In addition, SL-172154 bound CD40-expressing B cells in the peripheral blood and stimulated a dose-dependent migration of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood within 24 hours of treatment. We believe these data are supportive of either a once weekly or every other week dosing schedule. Histology samples demonstrated that the post-dose decreases in peripheral blood lymphocytes were accompanied by accumulation of proliferating lymphocytes in lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow. Whereas other CD47-targeted agents are administered at super-saturating doses, which we believe is intended to establish a concentration gradient that facilitates passive diffusion into tissues, we believe these data suggest that SL-172154 may be actively transported into tissues via CD40 binding, which may lead to a unique dosing profile in humans. Administration of SL-172154 was also associated with dose-dependent post-treatment increases in multiple serum cytokines, such as CCL2. Overall, SL-172154 was well tolerated; however, at the higher dose levels, we observed toxicities that were consistent with cytokine release syndrome in the setting of an anti-drug antibody response, which is expected in NHP because SL-172154 is a human protein construct. No evidence of anemia was observed.
Figure 6—CD47 Receptor Occupancy following SL-172154 Infusion
Cynomolgus monkeys were treated on Day 1 and 8 with 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg of SL-172154 or a vehicle control. Receptor occupancy was evaluated at the indicated time points by flow cytometry. SL-172154 occupancy on red blood cell CD47 is plotted as the proportion of total CD47 expression minus the proportion of CD47 detected using an antibody that is prevented from binding when CD47 is occupied by SL-172154.
SL-279252: A Dual PD-1 Blocking and OX40-Activating ARC Compound
Our second product candidate, SL-279252, is a dual-sided, bi-functional fusion protein that both inhibits the PD-/PD-L1 interaction and activates the OX40 costimulatory receptor. We are evaluating SL-279252 in an ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
Clinical Data Observed to Date 
In November 2021, at the SITC Meeting, we presented data from the dose-escalation portion of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial as monotherapy in late-stage solid tumor cancer patients. As of June 11, 2021 we had enrolled a total of 43 patients from the first ten dose levels, ranging from 0.0001 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg. Dose escalation was conducted according to the keyboard design. Patients received SL-279252 on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis with a 28-day cycle. The patients treated as of June 11, 2021, were heavily pretreated with a median of three prior lines of systemic therapies and 58% were checkpoint inhibitor experienced. 
As of our latest safety data cutoff date of January 19, 2022, SL-279252 has been observed to be well tolerated and has demonstrated monotherapy antitumor activity in some PD-1 inhibitor experienced patients during dose escalation at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher. Dose escalation is continuing in a primarily PD-1/L1 inhibitor experienced patient population. Treatment-related adverse events, including immune-related events, have been reported in some patients. To date, we have observed no Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events, and we have not observed any dose-limiting toxicities. A maximum tolerated dose has not been reached.
As of June 11, 2021, preliminary pharmacodynamic activity has been evaluated in patients treated across a dose range of 0.0001 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg. Increases in the number of proliferating CD8+ central memory and effector memory T cells were observed in the peripheral blood of some patients at higher peak SL-279252 concentrations corresponding to doses of 1.0 mg/kg or greater. Post-dose receptor occupancy on OX40+ lymphocytes was observed in a dose-dependent fashion, and the total number of OX40+ cells in the blood declined rapidly post-infusion of SL-279252. We believe the post-infusion decreases in OX40+ lymphocytes provides evidence of on-target activation. In NHP, similar post-infusion decreases in lymphocytes were associated with migration of lymphocytes into tissues. 
As of June 11, 2021, preliminary pharmacokinetic activity has been evaluated across a dose range of 0.0001 to 6 mg/kg. A linear increase in SL-279252 Cmax and AUC was observed up to 3.0 mg/kg, while a greater than proportional increase in AUC was observed at 6.0 mg/kg, suggesting potential target saturation at 6 mg/kg. Within subject exposure was similar on Days 1, 15 and 29, indicating no accumulation or time-dependent changes in pharmacokinetics on either schedule. The preliminary half-life is approximately 23 hours.
As of October 20, 2021, the best response to therapy has been one confirmed partial response, or PR, in a patient with ocular melanoma who remained on treatment for greater than one year. This patient was heavily pretreated, with four prior systemic regimens and had progressed on prior PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor therapies. In addition, stable disease, or SD, was seen in an additional 12 patients. In five of these patients, SD was sustained for greater than 24 weeks. One unconfirmed PR was observed in a patient with mucosal melanoma of the vulvar who had also progressed on prior PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor therapies. 
Clinical Development Strategy 
We are currently dosing at 12 mg/kg and plan to continue dose escalation to 24 mg/kg in our Phase 1 trial of SL-279252 in patients with advanced solid tumors and we are primarily selecting for patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors. The primary objective of the Phase 1 trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of SL-279252. The secondary objectives include evaluation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles as well as the antitumor activity of SL-279252. We are evaluating antitumor response according to immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors or Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma 2017. These are standard, widely-accepted criteria to evaluate tumor response in oncology clinical trials. We expect to provide additional data from the dose-escalation portion of this Phase 1 trial in the second half of 2022.
Given the way that the PD-1 inhibitor landscape has evolved, the development path for SL-279252 is first in PD-1 relapsed and refractory patients. 
To date, we have experienced delays in our clinical trial of SL-279252 because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we have experienced: delays with certain third-party vendors supporting this trial, including third-party manufacturers; difficulty procuring sufficient quantities of raw materials required for our manufacturing processes; delays as a result of some patients choosing to forego one or more doses in our clinical trials; and staffing shortages at many clinical trial sites. We expect to continue to experience some or all of these delays in the future. 
Our GADLEN Platform 
Our expertise in engineering dual-sided, bi-functional fusion proteins has enabled the development of our GADLEN platform to leverage gamma delta T cells for the treatment of cancer. 
The therapeutic utilization of gamma delta T cells represents a novel approach for the treatment of cancer. This approach may be particularly beneficial in targeting tumors that are not addressable by alpha beta T cells. Additionally, as immunotherapies that stimulate alpha beta T cell-dependent immune response are increasingly utilized across cancer treatment paradigms, we expect the proportion of patients who will become refractory to alpha beta T cell-mediated therapies will also increase over time, creating an opportunity for therapeutics which harness the antitumor activity of gamma delta T cells.
A majority of T cells in the human body bear an alpha beta T cell receptor, which recognizes tumor antigens presented on major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, molecules. Some cancer cells reduce the expression of MHC molecules or tumor antigens, rendering those cancer cells invisible to most alpha beta T cells. The predominant gamma delta T cell population in the peripheral blood expresses the V gamma 9 / V delta 2 T cell receptor and is activated by a heterodimer consisting of butyrophilin 2A1 and butyrophilin 3A1. Thus, therapeutics which are designed to display a heterodimer of butyrophilin 2A1 and 3A1 may provide a means of modulating gamma delta T cells in vivo. We have leveraged our expertise in engineering dual sided bi-functional fusion proteins to develop a suite of heterodimerized butyrophilin proteins connected to antigen-targeted single chain antibody fragments.
GADLEN compounds are comprised of two distinct fusion protein chains, and an engineered Fc linker domain that facilitates heterodimerization between the two chains. As shown in the left panel of Figure 7 below, the assembled GADLEN compound contains the extracellular domains of heterodimerized butyrophilin proteins on one side and is linked to tumor antigen specific single chain antibody fragments on the opposite side. The gamma delta T cell receptors recognize and are activated by specific butyrophilin protein heterodimers. Thus, the GADLEN construct is designed to facilitate targeting of specific gamma delta T cells to tumor cells expressing a defined antigen, as shown in the right panel of Figure 7 below.
Figure 7—GADLEN Platform Overview
To demonstrate the feasibility of the GADLEN approach, a murine GADLEN construct was developed incorporating a butyrophilin 1, or BTNL1, and butyrophilin 6, or BTNL 6, heterodimer and an scFv domain targeting the CD19 antigen. In both mice and humans, gamma delta T cells represent approximately 2% to 5% of the total T cell population, as shown in Figure 10 in a murine model. We treated mice on Days 0, 3, and 6 with the murine GADLEN, mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv. We observed dose-dependent expansion of the endogenous gamma delta T cell compartment to approximately 12% of all T cells 24 hours after the second treatment. Concurrent with expansion, mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv also caused activation of murine gamma delta T cells, as demonstrated by upregulation of the CD69 activation marker, shown in Figure 10. Murine B cells express CD19, and therefore were a potential target of gamma delta T cells following treatment with mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv. Accordingly, we observed depletion of the endogenous B cell compartment concurrent with gamma delta T cell expansion and activation following treatment with mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv, as shown in Figure 8. Importantly, when mice with established CD19+ tumors were treated with mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv, dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth and rejection was observed. We believe these studies indicate that GADLEN compounds enable therapeutic modulation of gamma delta T cells in vivo, and that GADLEN compounds may be designed to activate tissue-restricted populations of endogenous gamma delta T cells to target specific tumor antigens in both solid and liquid tumors.
Figure 8—Dose Dependent Gamma T Cell Expansion, Activation, and Killing Activity Following Administration of the GADLEN Compound mBTNL1/6-Fc-CD19scFv
To characterize the types of gamma delta T cell subsets that reside within different tumor types, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of patient tumor tissues, including multiple colorectal, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer patient tumors to identify the prevalent gamma delta T cell subsets in each tumor type. As a result of this analysis, we have advanced a number of preclinical GADLEN candidates comprised of butyrophilin heterodimers and tumor antigen specific targeting domains for a number of antigens with therapeutic relevance for both hematologic and solid tumors. Our preclinical findings with these GADLEN compounds have also revealed that gamma delta T cells, like alpha beta T cells, require costimulation through either costimulatory or natural cytoxicity receptors (NCR) for efficient T cell receptor activation. The data generated to date suggest these signals can be provided by the tumor cells that express costimulatory ligands and stress ligands that enable efficient activation of gamma delta T cell receptors via GADLEN compounds.
In alignment with our strategy to leverage our expertise to build and expand novel platforms beyond our ARC platform, where dual-sided fusion proteins may provide advantages over existing therapeutic antibodies, we continue to invest in and advance our GADLEN platform.
Collaboration and License Agreements
Collaboration Agreement with Takeda 
On August 8, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Takeda, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd., or the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement was subsequently amended in April 2018, October 2018 and March 2020. The Collaboration Agreement was 
mutually terminated pursuant to the termination agreement, or the Termination Agreement, dated November 8, 2021. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, we are not required to satisfy any remaining performance obligations, we will not make any payments to or receive any future milestone or royalty payments from Takeda, and all options to license and rights of first negotiation held by Takeda under the Collaboration Agreement were terminated. The remaining deferred revenue was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Heat License Agreement 
In June 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, or the Heat License Agreement, with Heat Biologics Inc., or Heat. The Heat License Agreement was subsequently amended in November 2016, December 2016, and March 2017. Pursuant to the Heat License Agreement, Heat granted to us (1) a worldwide, sublicensable exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize products under three provisional patent applications, including all patents issuing from such applications, or the Fusion Protein Patent Rights, and (2) a worldwide, sublicensable nonexclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain know-how owned and controlled by Heat related to the Fusion Protein Patent Rights.
Under the Heat License Agreement, Heat was required to conduct certain research and development services under a mutually-agreed upon research and development plan and Heat was eligible to receive financial support from us for these efforts. Effective March 2017, Heat completed all research and development services under the Heat License Agreement and assigned to us three patent applications and all data derived from the research and development activities, referred to collectively as the Research Services Inventions. Pursuant to the terms of the Heat License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently research and develop at least one product covered by the Fusion Protein Patent Rights, including the obligation to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for such product. Our development efforts to date, including the development of SL-279252 and certain other ARC compounds, satisfy these obligations. In addition, we are to provide annual reports to Heat on or before the anniversary of the effective date of the Heat License Agreement to inform Heat of our progress.
Unless sooner terminated or extended, the term of the Heat License Agreement continues until the later of (1) 20 years following the effective date, and (2) the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the agreement due to a material breach by the other party (subject to a 90-day cure period) or if the other party files for bankruptcy. In the event we terminate the Heat License Agreement due to a material breach by Heat, Heat must assign to us all right, title, and interest in the patent rights licensed under the Heat License Agreement.
In addition to an upfront payment of $50,000, which we made in 2016, the Heat License Agreement requires us to make further payments to Heat in the future of up to $20.6 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial sale milestones for certain licensed products. We are also required to pay Heat a percentage of certain upfront fees or other non-royalty payments that are not tied to milestone events which we receive in connection with certain sublicenses of the Fusion Protein Patent Rights. We are also required to pay Heat a royalty on all worldwide net sales by us, our affiliates, and sublicenses of certain licensed products in the low single digits. Royalties are payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, commencing on the first commercial sale of such product and continuing until the last-to-expire valid patent claim to the licensed patent rights that cover such product in that country.
Manufacturing and Supply 
By working with third-party vendors to conduct activities in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, we have invested significant resources to identify and scale up a suitable manufacturing process for ARC compounds, including SL-172154 and SL-279252. Currently, ARC compounds are produced by mammalian cell lines commonly used in the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies, including Chinese hamster ovary, or CHO, cells. Both SL-172154 and SL-279252 have achieved cell culture titer greater than two grams per liter, and another ARC compound has achieved titers exceeding seven grams per liter. Purification of ARC compounds initially utilizes affinity chromatography directed to the Fc domain for capture, and subsequent chromatography steps are designed to remove process-related impurities including CHO derived DNA and proteins. 
To date, we have manufactured bulk drug substance, or BDS, for our product candidates utilizing the services of one third-party contract manufacturer, KBI Biopharma, Inc., or KBI, with whom we maintain a master service agreement, pursuant to which we may manufacture BDS through KBI on a per project basis. We may terminate the master services agreement at any time for convenience in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Either KBI or we may also terminate the master services agreement with respect to an uncured breach by the other party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. These agreements include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
Given the complexity of manufacturing our dual-sided, bi-functional fusion proteins, our increased need for manufacturing driven by multiple clinical trial programs, and the challenges faced by biologics manufacturing facilities during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, we are actively working to make arrangements to procure redundant supply, including engaging with additional third-party manufacturers to identify suitable additional suppliers and building out a facility to support internal process development activities and cGMP manufacturing. We have recently entered into a master service agreement with Abzena Plc, pursuant to which we may manufacture BDS on a per project basis.
We expect to continue to devote significant resources to process development and optimization of the manufacture of our product candidates. To our knowledge, no other company has successfully scaled up commercial manufacturing of dual-sided, bi-functional fusion proteins. Due to the novelty of our product candidates, we may face challenges in developing large-scale manufacturing processes. Moreover, the nature of biologic medicines could create challenges for the stability of the drug substance. While these and other challenges may result in timeline delays and higher costs, we believe that we will have sufficient BDS to support our current clinical trial programs.
All of our product candidates are manufactured from a master cell bank of that protein’s production cell line. We have or intend to have one master cell bank for each product candidate that was or will be produced and tested in accordance with cGMP and applicable regulations. Each master cell bank is or will be stored in two independent locations, and we intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
Competition 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of cancer therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that develop cancer therapies. There are many other companies that have commercialized or are developing cancer therapies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche/Genentech and Gilead.
We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target specific tumor-associated antigens using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These generally include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR-Ts), antibody drug conjugates, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, targeted immunotoxin, and targeted cancer vaccines.
With respect to our lead product candidate, SL-172154, we are aware of other competing clinical-stage therapeutics that target the CD47 pathway or the CD40 pathway, which include, but are not limited to magrolimab, ALX148, TTI-621, TTI-622, DSP107, and APX005M.
With respect to our second lead product candidate, SL-279252, we are aware of other competing clinical-stage therapeutics, that target the PD-1 pathway or the OX40 pathway, which include, but are not limited to PF-04518600, BMS-986178, INBRX-106, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab, and atezolizumab.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and manufacturing capacity and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of 
companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that we consider commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining, and defending U.S. and foreign patent rights, including patents covering our platform technologies, product candidates, and methods of using the same, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity and market exclusivity, among others, as well as patent term extensions, where available.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, and know-how related to our business, including our platform technologies and product candidates, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular our patents rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating, or violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or those we will file or license from others, will grant us patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any granted patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors.
In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application may be significantly reduced before a patent is granted, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our products will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Information Technology” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
For any individual patent, the term depends on the applicable law in the country in which the patent is granted. In most countries where we have filed patent applications or in-licensed patents and patent applications, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed nonprovisional priority date. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed nonprovisional priority date, but may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a U.S. patent may also be lengthened by a Patent Term Adjustment in order to address administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.
In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for Patent Term Extension in order to restore the period of a patent term lost during the premarket FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a Patent Term Extension of up to five years beyond the natural expiration of the patent (but the total patent term, including the extension period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval). The term extension period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any Patent Term Extension in consultation with the FDA. In the future, we may decide to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to extend its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant biologics license application.
Intellectual property related to our most advanced programs is summarized below. We generally file patent applications directed to our key technologies and programs in an effort to secure our intellectual property positions. As of February 1, 2022, we own or exclusively license (i) more than 15 patents and more than 15 pending non-provisional patent applications in the United States and (ii) 3 patents and more than 120 pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We also own additional pending provisional patent applications in the United States and pending international patent applications 
filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. Patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and other patent offices may be significantly revised before issuance, if granted at all.

Trademark Protection
As of February 1, 2022, we own a registered trademark and an allowed application for “ARC” and an allowed application for “GADLEN” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We plan to register trademarks in connection with our biological products.
Licensed Intellectual Property from Heat Biologics, Inc.
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Heat, pursuant to which we received an exclusive (as to the patent rights), non-transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-bearing, non-field restricted license to certain patent rights and know-how, including rights related to the ARC platform. We paid Heat an initial license fee of $50,000, and we are obligated to pay Heat fees upon receipt of certain sublicensing income, achievement of certain milestones, and royalties upon sales of commercial products. The Heat license provides us rights in the patent family including PCT/US16/54598. As of February 1, 2022, that family includes (i) 10 patents and 3 pending non-provisional patent applications in the United States, and (ii) 2 patents and more than 25 pending applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including, among others, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and Japan). We control prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement of this family of patents and patent applications.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•manufacture of the proposed biologic candidate in accordance with cGMPs;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Preclinical and Clinical Development 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day 
period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
In addition to the IND submission process, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial pediatric study plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, 
the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through: the submission of clinical evidence, preclinical studies, clinical trials, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In May 2018, the Right to Try Act established a new regulatory pathway to increase access to unapproved, investigational treatments for patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions who have exhausted approved treatment options and who are unable to participate in a clinical trial. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants 
orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, 
warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
Our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our product candidates. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
The ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference 
biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. In September 2021, the FDA issued two guidance documents intended to inform prospective applicants and facilitate the development of proposed biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars, as well as to describe the FDA’s interpretation of certain statutory requirements added by the BPCIA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In July 2018, the FDA announced an action plan to encourage the development and efficient review of biosimilars, including the establishment of a new office within the agency that will focus on therapeutic biologics and biosimilars. On December 20, 2020, Congress amended the PHSA as part of the COVID-19 relief bill to further simplify the biosimilar review process by making it optional to show that conditions of use proposed in labeling have been previously approved for the reference product, which used to be a requirement of the application. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. As of March 2020, certain products previously approved as drugs under the FDCA, such as insulin and human growth hormone, are now deemed to be biologics under the PHSA, which means they may face competition through the biosimilars pathway and are not be eligible for the twelve-year period of exclusivity granted to new BLAs. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS; the federal False Claims Act, or FCA; HIPAA and similar foreign, federal and state fraud, abuse and transparency laws.
The AKS prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand, and prescribers and purchasers on the other. The government often takes the position that to violate the AKS, only one purpose of the remuneration need be to induce referrals, even if there are other legitimate purposes for the remuneration. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from AKS prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of federal government funds, including in federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for engaging in a variety of different types of conduct that caused the submission of false claims to federal healthcare programs. Under the AKS, 
for example, a claim resulting from a violation of the AKS is deemed to be a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA imposes mandatory treble damages and per-violation civil penalties up to approximately $23,000.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation.
The FDCA addresses, among other things, the design, production, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and testing of drugs, biologics and medical devices, and prohibits such acts as the introduction into interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded drugs or devices. The PHSA also prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of unlicensed or mislabeled biological products.
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such reporting obligations will be expanded to include payments and other transfers of value provided in 2021 to certain other healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal, and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations imposes privacy, security, and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve using, disclosing, creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information, in certain circumstances. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement 
exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
The Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the ACA’s requirement to carry health insurance, known as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA. In December 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Fifth Circuit upheld a ruling by a Texas U.S. District Court Judge that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. The Supreme Court heard the case but overturned the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs lacked standing and did not address the constitutionality. The Supreme Court’s decision left open the opportunity for additional challenges to the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including automatic aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year as part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, unless additional action is taken by Congress. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Medicare Act (as amended by the ACA) to increase the point-of-sale discounts that manufacturers must agree to offer under the Medicare Part D coverage discount program from 50% to 70% off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state measures designed to, among other things, reduce the cost of prescription drugs, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement 
methodologies for drug products. For example, in May 2019, CMS adopted a final rule allowing Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs, permitting Medicare Part D plans to apply certain utilization controls to new starts of five of the six protected class drugs, and requiring the Explanation of Benefits for Part D beneficiaries to disclose drug price increases and lower cost therapeutic alternatives, which went into effect on January 1, 2021. In October 2020, the FDA issued guidance describing procedures for manufacturers to facilitate the importation of FDA-approved biologics manufactured abroad and originally intended for sale in a foreign country into the United States. 
Although the Biden administration has stayed the effective dates of some last-minute drug price regulations issued by the Trump administration, Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Other Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, export and import, advertising, marketing and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization, approval as well as post-approval monitoring and reporting of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries.
Regulation in the European Union
European Data Laws
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or the GDPR, which came into force in May 2018, and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States. Under the GDPR, personal data can only be transferred to countries outside the EU Member States and the three additional European Economic Area, or EEA, countries (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) that have adopted a national law implementing the GDPR if such cross-border transfers comply with specific conditions. 
The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data of individuals within the EU and in the EEA, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to (i) the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, (ii) the information provided to such individuals prior to processing their personal data, (iii) data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities and (iv) the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also impose additional requirements. The GDPR increased responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance (up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater); other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and, in certain cases, their directors and officers; and civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level 
and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are regularly updated or otherwise revised.
Moreover, there is a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, European Medical Agency, or the EMA, disclosure initiatives and voluntary commitments by industry. Failure to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the EU Clinical Trials Regulation and the GDPR, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
With regard to the transfer of data from the EU to the United Kingdom, or UK, personal data may now freely flow from the EU to the UK since the UK is deemed to have an adequate data protection level. Such adequacy decisions include a ‘sunset clause’ which entails that the decisions will automatically expire four years after their entry into force (June 2025). Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the EEA, companies also have to comply with the UK’s data protection laws (including the GDPR as incorporated into UK national law). Penalties under this regime are up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.
Drug and Biologic Development Process
The conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Clinical Trials Directive, and will be replaced by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014, or Clinical Trials Regulation, once the latter comes into effect. The Clinical Trials Regulation introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. It entered into force on January 31, 2022.
Under the current regime, which will expire after a transition period of three years (as outlined below in more detail), before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted. The approval must be obtained from two separate entities: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
A more unified procedure will apply under the new Clinical Trials Regulation. A sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial form being conducted in such Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. After several postponements of the effective date of the Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems, the “go live” date of these systems and, accordingly, the coming into force of the regulation, occurred on January 31, 2022. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. Member States will work in CTIS immediately after the system has gone live. For one year, until January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors can still choose whether to submit an initial clinical trial application in line with the current system (Clinical Trials Directive) or via CTIS. After January 31, 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS becomes mandatory and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the current Clinical Trials Directive will be governed by the new Clinical Trials Regulation and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
Under both the current regime and the new Clinical Trials Regulation, national laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for 
designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.
Drug Marketing Authorization
In the European Union, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products, which are genes, cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation and that are administered to human beings in order to cure, diagnose or prevent diseases or regenerate, repair or replace a human tissue. We anticipate that our gene therapy development products will be regulated as ATMPs in the European Union under the EU Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMP Regulation. Pursuant to the ATMP Regulation, the Committee on Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although such guidelines are not legally binding, compliance with them is often necessary to gain and maintain approval for product candidates.
In the EEA, after completion of all required clinical testing, medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a related Marketing Authorization, or MA, has been granted. MAs can be obtained through, amongst others, a centralized procedure, which is compulsory for certain medicinal products such as ATMPs. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission, or EC, that is valid for all 27 EU Member States and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional EEA Member States (Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein). The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, ATMPs and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. It is optional for medicinal products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004, that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which the grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level. The timeframe for the evaluation of an application under the centralized procedure is 210 days, excluding clock stops. Typically, the overall process takes a year or more unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Applications may be eligible for accelerated assessment if the CHMP decides the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. On request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. However, the EC has final authority for granting the MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.
The decentralized marketing authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for a marketing authorization to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously for a pharmaceutical product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant a marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where the competent authority of an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies, or CMDh, for review.
All new marketing authorization applications must include a Risk Management Plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports, or PSURs, are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
Additionally, the holder of a marketing authorization for an ATMP must put in place and maintain a system to ensure that each individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport and delivery to the relevant healthcare institution where the product is used.
MAs have an initial duration of five years. The authorization may subsequently be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance unless the EC or the national competent authority grants only a five-year 
renewal on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
Data and Market Exclusivity
As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received a marketing authorization) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another marketing authorization for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. New chemical entities, or NCE, approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.
An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.
The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be added to the eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant preclinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year after the initial change was authorized).
Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to include a NCE. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full marketing authorization application with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. The EMA grants orphan drug designation if the medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union (prevalence criterion). In addition, Orphan Drug Designation can be granted if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product is a significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. An application for orphan drug designation (which is not a marketing authorization, as not all orphan-designated medicines reach the authorization application stage) must be submitted first before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Designated orphan medicines are eligible for conditional marketing authorization. 
The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products reassesses the orphan drug designation of a product in parallel with the review for a marketing authorization; for a product to benefit from market exclusivity it must maintain its orphan drug designation at the time of marketing authorization review by the EMA and approval by the EC. Additionally, any marketing authorization granted for an orphan medicinal product must only cover the therapeutic indication(s) that are covered by the orphan drug designation. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, orphan drug designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication.
During the 10-year period of market exclusivity, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as 
contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for an orphan-designated condition when the results of specific studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, addressing the pediatric population and completed in accordance with a fully compliant PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, i.e. the condition prevalence or financial returns criteria under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. When the period of orphan market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan drug designation for that indication expires as well. Orphan exclusivity runs in parallel with normal rules on data exclusivity and market protection. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (orphan or not) for the same or overlapping indication subject to certain requirements.
Pediatric Development
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a PIP together with a request for agreement to the EMA. The EMA issues a decision on the PIP based on an opinion of the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. Companies must conduct pediatric clinical trials in compliance with the PIP approved by the EMA, unless a deferral (e.g. until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available) or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) has been granted by the EMA. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of all pediatric clinical trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with the approved PIP, unless a waiver or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials may be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies on the basis of compelling non-clinical data and tolerability data from initial clinical trials. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, once a candidate medicine has been selected for the PRIME scheme, a dedicated contact point and rapporteur from the CHMP or from CAT are appointed facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting with the CHMP/CAT rapporteur initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts to provide guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy. PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of medicinal products.
Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or 
variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The holder of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. 
These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of PSURs in relation to medicinal products for which they hold MAs. The EMA reviews PSURs for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. If the EC agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations for which the EC’s decision provides can undermine the ongoing validity of the MA.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP. These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. Similarly, the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the European Union or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
The advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products and may differ from one country to another. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s SmPC as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Other Markets
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020. This means EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Following the end of the transition period, the EU and the UK concluded the TCA, which applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021.
The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the EU and the UK remain. Some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals are in place, including the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, and issued GMP documents. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable in the UK as “retained EU law.” As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has enacted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021. The purpose of the act is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks in relation to human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices to be updated. The powers under the act may only be exercised in relation to specified matters and must safeguard public health.
Specified provisions of the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 entered into force on February 11, 2021. The remaining provisions came into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or will otherwise come into effect as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments. The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002, or the UK Regulations, which are based on the EU Medical Devices Directive as amended to reflect the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime. Notably, the UK Regulations do not include any of the revisions that have been made by the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745, which, since May 26, 2021, now applies in all EU Member States. 
The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, conducted a comprehensive consultation between September and November 2021 on proposals to develop a new UK regime for medical devices in the UK. The proposals include more closely aligning definitions for medical devices and in vitro medical devices with internationally recognized definitions and changing the classification of medical devices according to levels or risk. The proposals are intended to improve patient and public safety and increase the appeal of the UK market. The new regime is planned to come into force on July 1, 2023, which will align with the date from which the UK is due to stop accepting CE marked medical devices and require UK Conformity Assessed marking. It is envisaged that, in Northern Ireland, the amended regime could run in parallel with any existing or future EU rules in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Human Capital Management
Shattuck Employees
As of December 31, 2021, Shattuck employed 85 full-time employees at two locations in the United States, including Austin, TX and Durham, NC. During 2021, we expanded our capabilities across the two sites by hiring 37 new employees. These employees were hired to support our clinical development, preclinical research and development, and efforts associated with operating as a public company.
We expect to continue to hire additional employees in 2022 and beyond with a focus on increasing expertise and bandwidth in preclinical and clinical research and development and in-house process development and manufacturing, as well as expanding our in-house general and administrative functions. The Company continually evaluates business needs and opportunities, with a hiring philosophy that balances in-house expertise with outsourced services. Currently, we outsource clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers.
Drug development is a complex endeavor which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Pharmaceutical companies compete for a limited number of highly qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract these applicants to the Company, Shattuck offers a total rewards package consisting of a base salary and cash target bonus targeting the 25th to 75th percentile of market based on geography, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for full-time employees. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility.
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. A large majority of Shattuck’s employees have obtained advanced degrees in their professions. Shattuck supports our employees’ further development with individualized development plans, mentoring, coaching, group training and conference attendance.
