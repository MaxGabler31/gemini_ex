Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Eastside Distilling, Inc. (the “Company,” “Eastside Distilling,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” below) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 2004 under the name of Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. In December 2014, we changed our corporate name to Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect our acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC. We operate in two segments. Our Spirits segment manufactures, blends, bottles, markets and sells a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands in 34 U.S. states. Our Craft Canning and Bottling segment provides canning and bottling services to the craft beer and cider industries in Washington, Oregon and Colorado. We employ 71 people in the United States.
Mission-What We Do
 
Our mission is to source, make and deliver the best in class, end-to-end craft spirits brands and product portfolio; and we contract pack cans and bottles with distinct capability and craftsmanship.
 
Vision-What We Want to Be
 
To be the one premium, preferred and “scaled” craft spirits, mobile canning and can printing company in the Western United States dominating the markets and segments we choose to serve.
 
Strategy
 
Our spirits brands span several alcoholic beverage categories, including whiskey, vodka, gin, rum, tequila and Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”). We sell our products on a wholesale basis to distributors in open states, and brokers in control states. Craft Canning + Bottling (“Craft C+B”) primarily services the craft beer, cider and kombucha business. Craft C+B operates 14 mobile lines in Seattle and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado.
 
Eastside Distilling is unique in several specific areas: (1) to our knowledge, we are the only craft spirits company listed on Nasdaq, (2) we do not function as a traditional craft distillery with store fronts relying on local sales, (3) our contract manufacturing division is diversified, and (4) we have a diversified portfolio of spirits brands. We are similar to other craft distillers in that (1) we have concentrated local volume, (2) we produce small batches and remain within the volume definition of “Craft”, and (3) our brands achieve success through differentiation, discovery and distribution.
 
The U.S. spirits market is occupied by large multi-national conglomerates with substantially more resources than Eastside Distilling. However, we can use our small size to be fast, focused, and flexible in our strategy. If we attempt to grow too quickly, we may lack the underlying strength required to build scale with loyalty via strong unaided awareness and powerfully derived attributes. Moreover, attempting to focus our “frame-of-reference” to compete with the biggest brands in the most expensive venues, is likely to fail unless we first establish underlying brand equity.

Our strategy is to utilize our public company stature to our advantage and position to expand our two distinct businesses – Spirits and Craft C+B. Our spirits portfolio is to be positioned as a leading regional craft spirits provider that develops brands, expands geographic presence and positions for either a sale to a tier 1 supplier or continued ownership with growth in revenue and cash flow. We look to grow and vertically integrate our Craft C+B business to expand our product offerings and improve our competitive position. These two segments are detailed below.
 
Segments
 
Spirits
 
Over the years, we have developed, matured, perfected, or acquired then launched many award-winning spirits while evolving to meet the growing demand for quality products and services associated with the burgeoning craft and premium beverage trade. Our portfolio includes originals like the Quercus garryana barrel-finished Burnside Whiskey family, Portland Potato Vodka, Hue-Hue Coffee Rum, and Azuñia Tequilas. We strive to bring premium beverages to the masses, not the few.

● | Burnside Whiskey Family – Our Burnside Whiskey Family celebrates the unique attributes of the native Oregon Oak tree (Quercus garryana). The unique complexity of each distinct whiskey comes from blending Oregon Oak barrels of differing sizes, char levels, and ages. After an initial experiment in 2012, we made it our mission to turn the Burnside program into a one-of-a-kind oak study. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Portland Potato Vodka – Our award-winning premium craft vodka is distilled four times to ensure a smooth finish. While most vodka is made from grain, we source award winning premium potato ethanol and blend it with pristine water sourced from Oregon. 
● | Hue-Hue (pronounced “way-way”) Coffee Rum – Premium silver rum is blended with concentrated cold-brewed coffee and a small amount of Demerara sugar. We source fair-trade, single-origin Arabica coffee beans from the Finca El Paternal Estate in Huehuetenango, Guatemala that are lightly roasted for us by Portland Coffee Roasters.

-


● | Azuñia Tequilas – Smooth, clean, tequilas crafted by Rancho Miravalle, a second generation, family-owned-and-operated estate, bursting with authentic flavor from the local terroir of Tequila Valley, Mexico. 100% pure Weber Blue Agave is harvested by hand, roasted in traditional clay hornos, and finished with a natural, open-air fermentation process. It is bottled on-site in small batches using a consistent process to deliver consistent field-to-bottle quality and exclusively exported by Agaveros Unidos de Amatitán. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Eastside Brands – We make the unique by blending together the unusual, craft inspired, experiential brands and high-quality artisan, in-and-out, seasonal and ongoing limited edition products. Each Eastside-branded product is rare and hard-to-get with a peculiar balance of age and innovation, craftsmanship and curiosity, creativity and restraint. 

Craft Canning + Bottling
 
With 10 years of experience in the canning business, we’ve become the West’s most trusted and premier mobile packaging provider. We serve locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado. Our team of professionals have packaged hundreds of award-winning products across both established and innovative beverage segments - beer, wine, cider, RTD cocktails, kombucha, seltzer, and many more. We use extensive proprietary and data-driven quality control measures and a robust clean-in-place procedure in order to provide the best packaging service for our customers. We take great pride in helping local beverage producers expand their distribution reach by using our service to offer industry-top quality and branding. Our greatest asset is the unmatched expertise of our talented group of packaging professionals who show up every day to go above and beyond to get the job done.

Our Craft mobile team offers a variety of services and products, including:
 

● | High Mobile Canning Capacity – We operate 14 Wild Goose MC-250 machines, with the capacity to can over 150,000 barrels per year. In addition to the canning lines, we use custom in-house designed fully automated depalletizers and twist rinses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Large Craft Volumes – With capabilities of around 600-800 cases per shift, we can manage any volume. Averaging 40 cans per minute, each machine can do 100 cases per hour. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Dedicated Team – All of our employees are carefully and rigorously trained. A fully insured workforce is ready to take on any and all of the customer’s packaging needs. We believe in continuous improvement and we understand the value of our clients’ products and dedicate ourselves to making every run a successful run. 
● | Quality Control – Hach Orbispheres measure our dissolved oxygen (“DO”) during packaging to ensure the lowest Total Packaged Oxygen for the customer’s can. We use luminometers and ATP swabs to ensure sanitation of our equipment. We can provide Zahm & Nagel volume meters to measure carbon dioxide (“CO2”) volumes in carbonated products before packaging. As masters of the “double seam” we frequently take on-site measurements with micrometers. We also offer CMC Kuhnke technology to generate even more accurate measurements in the form of visual seam reports. 
● | Velcorin and Nitrogen Dosing – We have both velcorin and nitrogen dosing capabilities that supports microbial control and allows packaging of still products in addition to carbonated and nitrogenated beverages.

● | Pre-printing and Outfeed Labeling – Bringing on advanced digital can printing technology from Hinterkopf in Q2 2022 allows us to offer customers both world-class aesthetics and full sustainability in an end-to-end branding and packaging solution, accessible from our smallest to our largest customers. We also provide outfeed labeling and the ability to package customer-provided branded cans of all varieties. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Location Flexibility – We allow our customers to choose the location of canning. We bring our mobile equipment to their facility, or our customers can bring their product to us for co-packing. 

 
We have secured an innovative printer that will revolutionize the growing custom canning operation. The new printer, the German-made Hinterkopf D240.2, is the only one of its kind on the West Coast and one of ten in the world. The new acquisition gives Craft C+B the ability to offer unparalleled customization and flexibility to craft beverage producers seeking direct printing for canning projects of all sizes. The new printer will be in operation starting April 2022.
 

We will print 12-ounce or 16-ounce cans in any quantity with any image, with a minimum order of 400 cans. This flexibility allows for custom graphics of limited releases, vintages, partnerships, and special events.
 

In anticipation of the printer, we partnered with a leading can provider to provide quality canning services from end to end. The new partnership guarantees a current and future supply of domestically manufactured Crown cans, cost-effective solutions for our customers, and improved logistics for beverage producers.
 
Production and Supply
 
Bringing a brand to market involves several important stages, including bottle and label design, raw materials procurement, filling the bottles, and packaging the bottles in various configurations for shipment. To achieve a unique flavor profile for each brand, we use one or more of the following techniques: infusion of fruit, addition of natural flavorings, blending of products, and aging in selected casks. Once the final profile is approved and quality control standards are met, we filter the liquid as needed and bottle or can the product.
 
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of our spirit products and raw materials, including our distillate products and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S and Mexico. One key supplier is Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV., which supplies tequila to us. We are working with this key supplier to adjust contract terms that we have been subject to since the acquisition of the Azuñia Tequila assets in 2019. We do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our other suppliers for the production of raw materials. However, we believe that we have consistent and reliable third-party sources for the needed materials. We produce and bottle all our spirits for distribution, regardless of whether the distillation phase of the process was at our facility or at one of our suppliers.

Distribution Network
 
U.S. Distribution
 
Producers and importers of beverage alcohol in the U.S. must sell their products through a three-tier distribution system. Typically, a brand is first sold to a network of distributors, or wholesalers, covering the U.S., in either “open” states or “control” states.
 
In the 33 open states, the distributors are generally large, privately held companies. The distributors and wholesalers in turn sell to individual retailers, such as liquor stores, restaurants, bars, supermarkets and other outlets licensed to sell alcoholic beverages. We primarily focus our distribution efforts in six open states; California, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Washington and Florida.
 
In the 17 control states, the states themselves function as the distributor, and regulate suppliers, including our Company. In control states, producers and importers sell their products directly to state liquor authorities, which distribute the products and either operate retail outlets or license the retail sales function to private companies, while maintaining strict control over pricing and profit. Our largest distribution channel is in the state of Oregon through the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.
 
The U.S. spirits industry has consolidated dramatically over the last ten years due to merger and acquisition activity. Eight major spirits companies currently dominate the industry, each of which owns and operates its own importing businesses. All companies, including these large companies, are required by law to sell their products through wholesale distributors in the U.S. The major companies continue to exert increasing influence over the regional distributors and as a result, it has become increasingly difficult for smaller companies to get their products recognized by distributors.
 
We hold the federal importer and wholesaler license required by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department and the requisite state licenses within the states in which we conduct business.
 
Our inventory is maintained in offsite bonded warehouses at our producers, our bonded warehouse in Milwaukie, Oregon, and at bonded warehouses managed by Park Street, our fulfillment and logistics partner. We also typically have inventory in transit that we ship nationally through our network of licensed and bonded carriers.
 
Wholesalers and Distributors
 
In the United States, we are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in the control states, state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our brands to retail outlets. As a result, we depend on distributors for sales, product placement and retail store penetration. All of the distributors with whom we currently work also distribute our competitors’ products and brands. As a result, we must foster and maintain our relationships with our distributors. Through our internal sales team, we have established relationships for our brands with wholesale distributors in the states where we sell our products, and our products are sold in the U.S. by these wholesale distributors, as well as by various state beverage alcohol control agencies.
Significant Customers
 
Sales to one customer, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 20% and 18% of our consolidated sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
Sales Team
 
Spirits
 
We have a total spirits sales force of eight people and have an average of over ten years of industry experience with premium spirits brands.

Our spirits sales personnel are engaged in the day-to-day interaction with our distributors, which includes setting quotas, coordinating promotional plans for our brands, maintaining adequate levels of stock, brand education and training and sales calls with distributor personnel. Our sales team also maintains relationships with key chain and retail customers through independent sales calls. They also schedule promotional events, create local brand promotion plans, host in-store tastings, where permitted, and provide wait staff and bartender training and education for our brands.
 
In addition, we have also engaged for our spirits business Park Street, a provider of back-office administrative, fulfillment, and logistical services for alcohol and beverage distributors, which services include state compliance, logistics planning, order processing, order fulfillment, distributor chargeback and bill-support management and certain accounting and reporting services. We believe given our smaller scale that we can leverage the outsourced services of Park Street to reduce complexity and increase profitability.
 
Craft C+B
 
The canning sales force is made up of four members, three of which focus on their respective regions. Their goal is to connect with and onboard new clients, survey and promote new and emerging beverage markets for craft package services, as well as maintain relations with current clients. The sales team provides a premium customer service experience from introductory conversations about mobile canning to the very first packaging day and beyond. Their previous experience of operating the equipment gives them deep knowledge to share with prospective customers, including trust and accountability. Our sales team is keen on strong partnerships that allow for sustainable success. And we partner with local guilds and associations for creative collaborations, booth events and sponsorships.
 
Advertising, Marketing and Promotion
 
To build and sell our brands, we must effectively communicate with three distinct audiences: distributors, retail trade and end consumers. Social media, sponsorships, micro events sampling and other promotional activities help to establish and reinforce the image of our brands, and to provide the push into the trade and pull through out of the trade that our customers demand.
 
In the spirits category, consumers “drink the image,” therefore brand identity and getting consumers through the purchase funnel (awareness, consideration, trail, purchase and advocacy) is just as important as pricing, promotion and place in the marketing mix.
 
For major marketing decisions regarding high stakes activity like packaging changes and new product development, we conduct primary qualitative and quantitative research with end consumers. Our fundamental strategy is to “learn as we grow” – market test and then consistently challenge ourselves to be vigilant about what worked, what didn’t and whether to stop, continue or improve.
 
We have significantly narrowed our focus on building three main brands, Burnside Whiskeys, Portland Potato Vodka and Azuñia Tequilas, across six key markets.
 
In Oregon, which has the strongest distribution for Burnside Whiskeys and Portland Potato Vodka, our focus is on closing the distribution gaps and on driving consumer pull through major local sponsorships in Portland, Oregon of the Portland Trail Blazers, Portland Pickles and Hood To Coast Relay. These are all both brand building and volume driving opportunities.
 
In our five other key states where Azuñia is the lead brand, driving distribution is the main priority, with some local tequila events and tastings scheduled to drive awareness and trial. In these states, we focus mostly on price promotions, point-of-sale materials, and in-store and off-premise promotions to make the most of our limited resources.

Intellectual Property
 
Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks which we own. Our brands are protected by trademark registrations or are the subject of pending applications for trademark registration in the U.S. where we distribute our brands. The trademarks may be registered in the names of our subsidiaries. In the U.S., trademark registrations need to be renewed every ten years. We expect to register our trademarks in additional markets as we expand our distribution territories.
Seasonality
 
Our business has historically followed the spirits industry seasonality trends with peak sales generally occurring in the fourth calendar quarter in spirits, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Our Craft C+B business typically has peak sales mid to late summer.
Competition
 
We compete on the basis of quality, authenticity, and artisanal spirits. Our premium brands compete with other alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages for market share. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, many of which have greater resources than us. We focus on the premium and super-premium segments of the market, which typically have higher prices per case and higher gross profit margins, and with our experienced marketing and sales force, we believe that we provide greater focus on smaller brands and individual consumer preferences and take advantage of regional market opportunities. However, our relative capital position and resources may limit our marketing capabilities, our ability to expand into new markets and our negotiating ability with our distributors.
 
Over the past ten years, the U.S. wine and spirits industry has undergone dramatic consolidation and realignment of brands and brand ownership. The number of major importers in the U.S. has declined significantly. Today, we believe eight major companies dominate the market: Diageo PLC, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Brown-Forman Corporation, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., and Rémy Cointreau S.A. These competitors have substantially greater resources than we do.
 
The mobile canning and bottling industry is highly fragmented and very competitive. The threat of new entrants is high. Moreover, we compete at the hyper-local scale, where we have a customer base concentrated in the craft beer segment. One of our greatest threats associated with losing customers is the customer’s own growth and success. As new brewers grow, they are able to afford the investment in their own canning line.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, U.S. Customs laws, and the Alcoholic Beverage Control laws of the states where our products are distributed, among many other regulations.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulates the production, blending, bottling, sales and advertising and transportation of alcohol products. Also, each state regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale and distribution of alcohol products within its jurisdiction. We are also required to conduct business in the U.S. only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell spirits.
 
We are subject to U.S. regulations on spirits, marketing, and advertising, such as style, media and messages. Labeling of spirits is also regulated in many markets, varying from health warning labels to importer identification, alcohol strength and other consumer information. All beverage alcohol products sold in the U.S. must include warning statements related to risks of drinking beverage alcohol products.
 
In the U.S. control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Consumers may purchase products not selected for listings only through special orders, if at all.

The distribution of alcohol-based beverages is also subject to extensive federal and state taxation in the U.S. and internationally. Most foreign countries impose excise duties on wines and distilled spirits, although the form of such taxation varies from a simple application on units of alcohol by volume to intricate systems based on the imported or wholesale value of the product. Several countries impose additional import duty on distilled spirits, often discriminating between categories in the rate of such tariffs. If we begin distributing our products internationally, import and excise duties could have a significant effect on our sales, both through reducing the consumption of alcohol and through encouraging consumer switching into lower-taxed categories of alcohol.
 
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2022, we have 71 employees, 12 of whom are in sales and marketing, 43 in production/canning/bottling, and 16 of whom are in administration. All employees are full-time with the exception of 2 part time production employees. We will continue to monitor our staffing in light of the impacts of COVID and streamlining on our operations for working capital needs.
Geographic Information
 
Spirits currently sells its products in 34 states. Craft C+B operates in three states.
