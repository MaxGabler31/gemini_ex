ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 When used in this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “our,” “us,” and “Kodak” refer to the consolidated company on the basis of consolidation described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.  Also, unless otherwise indicated by the context, “EKC” means the parent company, Eastman Kodak Company (the “Company”).
 Kodak provides directly, and through partnerships with other innovative companies hardware, software, consumables and services to customers in graphic arts, commercial print, publishing, packaging, electronic displays, entertainment and commercial films, and consumer products markets.  With its world-class R&D capabilities, innovative solutions portfolio and highly trusted brand, Kodak is helping customers around the globe to sustainably grow their own businesses and enjoy their lives.
 Kodak is a global commercial printing and imaging company with proprietary technologies in materials science, digital imaging science and software, and deposition processes (methods whereby one or more layers of various materials in gaseous, liquid or small particle form are deposited on a substrate in precise quantities and positions).  Kodak leverages its core technology products and services to develop solutions for the product goods packaging and graphic communications markets, and is developing products for the functional printing market. Kodak also offers brand licensing and intellectual property opportunities, provides products and services for motion pictures and other commercial films, and sells ink to its existing installed consumer inkjet printer base.
 The Company was founded by George Eastman in 1880 and incorporated in 1901 in the State of New Jersey.  Kodak is headquartered in Rochester, New York.
 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
 Kodak has seven reportable segments:  Print Systems, Enterprise Inkjet Systems, Flexographic Packaging, Software and Solutions, Consumer and Film, Advanced Materials and 3D Printing Technology and Eastman Business Park.  The balance of Kodak’s continuing operations, which do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment, are reported in All Other which primarily represents the RED utilities variable interest entity until deconsolidation in December 2016 (refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).
 Information on Kodak's revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area as well as revenues and earnings by reportable segment for each of the past three years are shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.
 Print Systems
 The Print Systems segment is comprised of Prepress Solutions, which includes Kodak’s digital offset plate offerings and computer-to-plate imaging solutions, and Electrophotographic Printing Solutions, which offers high-quality digital printing solutions using electrically charged toner based technology.  The Print Systems segment provides digital and traditional product and service offerings to a variety of commercial industries, including commercial print, direct mail, book publishing, newspapers and magazines and packaging.  While the businesses in this segment are experiencing pricing pressure, innovations in Kodak product lines that can command premium prices offset some of the long-term market price erosion.
 Prepress Solutions capitalizes on a contract-based, stable and recurring cash flow-generative business model. The average duration of customer contracts is two years. These contracts offer stability and generate recurring revenue. The core of the business is the manufacturing of aluminum digital printing plates of varying sizes. These plates can be as small as 23cm x 27cm and as large as 126cm x 287cm.  Unexposed plates are sold to commercial printing companies for use in the offset printing process. Kodak also manufactures equipment, known as Computer to Plate (“CTP”) equipment, which images the plates with a laser. The plates are used in the offset printing process, which transfers ink from the plate onto a rubber blanket and then onto the substrate to be printed. Due to the nature of the imaging and printing process, a new plate must be used for each printing run. As a result, there is a recurring revenue stream from the sale of these plates.
 The Print Systems products and services are sold globally to customers through both a direct sales team as well as indirectly through dealers. Primary competitors are Fuji and Agfa.  Kodak expects to benefit from current industry trends, including customers’ increasing focus on sustainability initiatives, which strengthens demand for Kodak’s process-free solutions.

Eastman Business Park
 The Eastman Business Park segment includes the operations of the Eastman Business Park, a more than 1,200-acre technology center and industrial complex in Rochester, New York and the leasing activities related to that space. A large portion of this facility is used in Kodak’s own manufacturing and other operations, while the remaining portion is occupied by external tenants or available for rent to external tenants.  Three tenants represent approximately 50% of total Eastman Business Park segment revenues.  A tenant that represented approximately 30% of segment revenues for the years ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, and 35% of segment revenues for the year ending December 31, 2015 notified Kodak that it does not plan to renew its lease upon expiration in the third quarter of 2018.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 Discontinued operations of Kodak include the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging businesses (“PI/DI Business”).  Refer to Note 25, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Financial Statements for additional information.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA
 Financial information by geographic area for the past three years is shown in Note 24, “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Financial Statements.
 RAW MATERIALS
 The raw materials used by Kodak are many and varied, and are generally readily available.  Lithographic aluminum is the primary material used in the manufacture of offset printing plates.  Kodak procures lithographic aluminum coils from several suppliers with pricing based, in part, on either prevailing market prices for aluminum or on fixed prices for aluminum agreed to up to one year prior.   Electronic components are used in the manufacturing of commercial printers and other electronic devices.  The film and chemicals business uses many raw materials from a broad range of suppliers.  Polymer and resin raw materials are used in the manufacture of flexographic printing plates and films.  Most electronic components, raw materials and other components are generally available from multiple sources.  However, certain key electronic components, raw materials and other components included in the finished goods manufactured by Kodak and manufactured by and purchased from Kodak’s third-party suppliers are obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects Kodak to supply risks.
SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS
 Equipment and plate unit sales generally are higher in the fourth quarter, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices and buying patterns.
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 Kodak's general practice is to protect its investment in research and development and its freedom to use its inventions by obtaining patents.  The ownership of these patents contributes to Kodak's ability to provide industry-leading products.  Kodak holds portfolios of patents in several areas important to its business, including the specific technologies previously discussed, such as flexographic and lithographic printing plates and related equipment systems; digital printing workflow and color management proofing systems; color and black-and-white electrophotographic printing systems including key press components and toners; commercial inkjet writing systems and components, presses and inks; consumer inkjet inks and media; functional printing materials, formulations, and deposition modalities; security materials; embedded information; and color negative films, processing and print films.  Each of these areas is important to existing and emerging business opportunities that bear directly on Kodak's overall business performance.
 Kodak's major products are not dependent upon one single, material patent.  Rather, the technologies that underlie Kodak's products are supported by an aggregation of patents having various remaining lives and expiration dates.  There is no individual patent, or group of patents, whose expiration is expected to have a material impact on Kodak's results of operations.
 Total research and development expenses were $53 million in 2017, $60 million in 2016 and $61 million in 2015.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
 Kodak is subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters.  The U.S. federal environmental legislation and state regulatory programs having an impact on Kodak include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the NY State Chemical Bulk Storage Regulations and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (the “Superfund Law”).
 It is Kodak’s policy to carry out its business activities in a manner consistent with sound health, safety and environmental management practices, and to comply with applicable health, safety and environmental laws and regulations.  Kodak continues to engage in programs for environmental, health and safety protection and control.
 Based upon information presently available, future costs associated with environmental compliance are not expected to have a material effect on Kodak's capital expenditures or competitive position, although costs could be material to a particular quarter or year.
 EMPLOYMENT
 At the end of 2017, Kodak employed the full time equivalent of approximately 5,800 people globally, of whom approximately 2,600 were employed in the U.S.  The actual number of employees may be greater because some individuals work part time.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 Kodak files many reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (www.sec.gov), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  These reports, and amendments to these reports, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after being electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.  They are available through Kodak's website at www.Kodak.com.  To reach the SEC filings, follow the links to About Kodak, Investor Center, Financial Information and then SEC Filings.
