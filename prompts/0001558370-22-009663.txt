ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
The Container Store® is the original and leading specialty retailer of storage and organization products and solutions in the United States and the only national retailer solely devoted to the category. We provide a collection of creative, multifunctional and customizable storage and organization solutions that are sold in our stores and online through a high-service, differentiated shopping experience. We feature The Container Store Custom Closets consisting of our elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, Avera® and Laren® closet lines. In fiscal 2021, the Company acquired Closet Parent Company, Inc. (“Closet Works”) which expanded our manufacturing capabilities to include wood-based spaces and enhanced our premium wood-based product offering. On April 2, 2022 we added the wood-based closet line PrestonTM closet to The Container Store Custom Closets. Our customers are highly educated, very busy and primarily homeowners with a higher than average household income. Our customers crave discovery, inspiration, and solutions that simplify their lives and maximize their spaces within their homes. Our vision is to deepen our relationship with our customers, expand our reach and strengthen our capabilities, all while transforming lives through the power of organization. 
We were founded in 1978 in Dallas, Texas as The Container Store, Inc. In 2007, The Container Store, Inc. was sold to The Container Store Group, Inc. In November 2013, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on The New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TCS.” In fiscal 2021, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.1 billion. Today our operations consist of two reportable segments:

● | The Container Store (“TCS”) consists of our retail stores, website and call center (which includes business sales), as well as our in-home services business. We operate 94 stores with an average size of approximately 25,000 square feet (19,000 selling square feet) in 33 states and the District of Columbia. We offer our customers their choice of how to shop—in-store, online or through our in-home services. Our stores receive all of our products directly from one of our two distribution centers. Our first distribution center in Coppell, Texas, is co-located with our corporate headquarters and call center, and our second distribution center is located in Aberdeen, Maryland. In fiscal 2021, TCS had net sales of $1.0 billion, which represented approximately 94% of our total consolidated net sales. On December 30, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Closet Works, a designer, manufacturer and supplier of wood-based custom home storage and organization solutions for total cash consideration of $21.4 million which is included in the TCS reportable segment. Closet Works, based in Chicago, Illinois, services the United States by offering customized solutions for closets, garages, home offices, pantries, laundry rooms, murphy beds and built-in wall units.

● | Elfa, The Container Store, Inc.’s wholly owned Swedish subsidiary, Elfa International AB (“Elfa”), designs and manufactures component-based shelving and drawer systems and made-to-measure sliding doors. Elfa was founded in 1948 and is headquartered in Malmö, Sweden. Elfa’s shelving and drawer systems are customizable for any area of the home, including closets, kitchens, offices and garages. Elfa operates three manufacturing facilities with two located in Sweden and one in Poland. The Container Store began selling elfa® products in 1978 and acquired Elfa in 1999. Today our TCS segment is the exclusive distributor of elfa® products in the U.S. and represented approximately 46% of Elfa’s total sales in fiscal 2021. Elfa also sells its products on a wholesale basis to various retailers in approximately 30 countries around the world, with a concentration in the Nordic region of Europe. In fiscal 2021, the Elfa segment had $70.9 million of third party net sales, which represented approximately 6% of our total consolidated net sales.

Strategic Priorities
 The Container Store exists to transform lives through the power of organization. We plan to accomplish this singular vision by executing our three strategic priorities, which include: deepening our relationship with customers, expanding our reach and strengthening our capabilities. During fiscal 2021, we made significant strides against these initiatives and we delivered the best financial results in the Company’s history with net sales of over $1 billion dollars for the first time. We have also made progress toward our goal of achieving $2 billion in annual sales by fiscal 2027 (fiscal year ending April 1, 2028). While we are still in the early stages of our goals, we have much to be proud of.
Strategic Pillar One: Deepening Our Relationship with Customers
 We believe our continued focus on deepening our customer relationship, while also driving profitability, demonstrates the appeal of our brand and the strength of our offering. We successfully reduced our promotional cadence throughout the year, which continued with our fourth quarter “Transform with Elfa” event. With less dependence on promotions in fiscal 2021, we focused on enhancing our in-store shopping experience by adding store greeters, front of store product spotlights and product demonstrations. Additionally, we have curated our product assortment to align with customer interests and values, including offering over 1,600 sustainable SKUs, an increase of 60% over last year.
During fiscal 2021, we launched our new branding campaign and fully reimagined company logo. The campaign, Welcome to The Organization, is an open invitation to all, to learn and discover the power of organization and to start their transformational journey. The campaign resonated with new and existing customers across our channels and resulted in a record-breaking single-day sales on 2/22/22. The new logo reflects a more modern and expressive era for the brand. The icon resembles three nested baskets in a subtle, uplifting smile, and represents our core differentiators–the largest assortment of organizing solutions; premium custom closets; and unmatched in-home services.
To further engage customers and attract new ones, we launched a new loyalty program, Organized Insider. Organized Insider is a tier-based loyalty program that rewards customer engagement and it incorporates customer favorite benefits from the past loyalty program. Both our website, containerstore.com, and The Container Store mobile app features an Organized Insider dashboard allowing customers to easily access their status, available offers, and exclusive benefits. 
Strategic Pillar Two: Expanding Our Reach
 We continue to be a market leader in the custom closets space and expanded our reach through the acquisition and integration of the Chicago-based home storage solutions and closet organization company, Closet Works. This strategic acquisition expanded our manufacturing capabilities to include wood-based spaces and enhanced our premium wood-based product offering. We are pleased that our modular metal-based manufacturing capability through Elfa, coupled with our new premium wood-based manufacturing capability, is expected to provide us the opportunity to not only benefit from improved margins, but allows us to deliver a custom and superior offering for every space of the home. Over the past year, we also increased the number of design specialists focused on designing and selling premium spaces from 64 to 96, with at least half of the designers selling more than $1 million in fiscal 2021. We are confident in our ability to deliver higher average tickets and improved sales productivity in our custom closet business.
We opened a new store in Annapolis, MD, in fiscal 2021 and are excited to open our two new smaller-format stores in Colorado Springs, Colorado, expected in the fall of calendar year 2022 and in Salem, New Hampshire, expected in the winter of calendar year 2022. We believe that we have attractive growth opportunities in key markets for potential expansion of an additional 74 new stores by the end of fiscal 2027.
Lastly, we made significant strides in fiscal 2021 to enhance our e-commerce. We maintained a healthy e-commerce penetration and made enhancements to our site including an improved browsing experience, smart filtering, sustainable product badging, enhanced site speed by 45% across our category and product pages, and added more compelling content. We will continue to identify ways to grow and improve our e-commerce experience.

Strategic Pillar Three: Strengthening Our Capabilities
Technology advancements continue to be a core focus. We have added more payment options for customers, including Afterpay, PayPal and a mobile point of sale solution. Additionally, we successfully launched our first-ever mobile app to meet customers where they are already shopping. The app features a convenient biometric login, an Organized Insider dashboard, and makes it simple for customers to shop using their digital wallet. Customers can also use the app to check an order status, find organizing inspiration or use it in store to scan bar codes for more product information and options.
We are also pleased with the fiscal 2021 additions to our company leadership team including a Chief Information Officer, Vice President (“VP”) of Merchandising, VP of Real Estate, Senior Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and a Senior Director of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”). 
With regards to being an employer of choice, we conducted a third-party pay equity study to ensure we are being equitable and inclusive in how we compensate our employees, regardless of race, age, gender or ethnicity. Additionally, we launched a Supplier Diversity program to intentionally invest in diverse vendors and we increased our minimum wage to $15 per hour for all hourly employees.
For our ESG strategy, further discussed below, we performed an assessment to establish our key areas of focus and completed our first sustainability report. Additionally, we joined the U.S. EPA Green Power Partnership and ranked #14 of the top 30 participating retailers for our total annual green power usage.
As we look ahead, we accomplished much in fiscal 2021 and established a strong foundation to build upon in fiscal 2022. As we continue on our path to reach $2 billion in sales by the end of fiscal year 2027, we will focus on these same strategic priorities to drive our future growth and address the incredible opportunity we have to continue to gain market share.
Our Key Differentiators
The Container Store Custom Closets:
Our focus on The Container Store Custom Closets, full complementary space completion products, and in-home services, provides a unique opportunity to drive sales through higher average ticket while differentiating the Company from other brick and mortar and online, items-based retailers. Our highly trained and experienced sales force has been selling, custom-designed and other closet solutions for over 43 years. We believe there is no other comparable retailer executing this holistic approach to custom closets. We offer the complete custom closet solution—not just our full line custom closets, but the full array of closet organization products that accompany those closets, as well as a national footprint with millions of customers coming through the door and visiting our online site each year. We design and sell The Container Store Custom Closets in-store, in-home, online, and through our call center.
Our elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor and Avera® closet lines as well as other elfa® products continue to be an ever important, highly profitable and differentiating component in the growth of our Company and reflect our commitment to dominating the custom closet market. In fiscal 2021, all Elfa-produced products accounted for approximately 30% of our TCS retail sales. Due to our vertical integration with Elfa, we have control over the sourcing and availability of elfa® Classic, elfa® Décor, and Avera®, our best selling and highest margin products. We are the exclusive distributor of Elfa-manufactured products in the United States. Approximately 19% of our fiscal 2021 TCS segment purchases were attributed to intercompany purchases from our Elfa segment. 
We are also excited that we have expanded our manufacturing capabilities and enhanced our premium wood-based product offering with the acquisition of Closet Works. On April 2, 2022 we added the PrestonTM collection to our custom closet offering. We expect this custom closet line to be margin accretive as we now own the manufacturing for this premium line.

Our Shopping Experience: 
We strive to create an Air of Excitement® in each of our stores across the country. You can experience the Air of Excitement® through our employees’ smiling faces and their genuine interest in a customer’s organizational projects and in the bright visual displays of products and solutions.
This is coupled with our highly personalized approach to customer service. Our employees are trained to ask questions to understand our customers’ needs. We believe that if we discover the underlying storage and organization challenges of our customers, we truly help them and hopefully improve the quality of their life. Service and selling are synonymous at The Container Store. We believe we can best serve our customers by astonishing them with personalized service and providing the solutions they most need to accomplish their organizational projects.
We are a multi-channel retailer, with a fully-integrated website, responsive mobile site and application and call center to complement our physical stores. Our website, containerstore.com, is intended to replicate the store experience offering virtually the same product assortment and providing real time inventory information for our stores, as well as certain products found exclusively online. We enhance the customer’s experience and deepen loyalty by creating consistent, relevant messages, regardless of which channel is being used. We offer free shipping on orders over $75 and our customers are able to purchase online and pick up at a store, with curbside pick-up in most markets, or request same-day home delivery in select markets. The website, mobile site, mobile application and call center sales channels combined accounted for approximately 24% of TCS net sales in fiscal 2021.
Our Stores:
We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and nationally recognized brand name to successfully develop new stores in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. Our current footprint of 94 stores extends to 33 states and the District of Columbia. We see the potential to add 76 new stores by the end of fiscal 2027. In fiscal 2021, we opened one new store in Annapolis, Maryland. We expect to open two new stores in fiscal 2022. While our current expansion focus is on domestic markets, we believe international expansion may provide additional growth opportunities for us in the future.
We have a strong base of profitable stores and believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We plan to seek out strategic and profitable real estate expansion via a variety of store formats and sizes. In fiscal 2021, our new store in Annapolis, Maryland was designed as a reduced-sized footprint store and our anticipated two new stores in fiscal 2022 are also being designed as reduced-sized footprint stores. Our typical new store opening includes a strategic marketing plan inclusive of public relations and comprehensive training for our store employees that includes product education, solution-selling education, operational education and company culture understanding – all of which we believe enables our new stores to deliver strong sales volume more quickly.
Our Unique Product Collection:
Our merchandising philosophy is to provide a carefully curated, one-of-a-kind collection of storage and organization solutions for every area of the home, at a variety of price points. We offer over 11,000 products designed to provide customers solutions that simplify their lives and maximize their spaces within their homes. Each year, we introduce approximately 2,000 new SKUs. Our solutions-based selling approach (versus items-based) is delivered by our highly trained salespeople. We believe helping customers accomplish their organizational projects by selling solutions primarily consisting of exclusive, proprietary products differentiates us from other retailers. In fact, in fiscal 2021, over half of our annual sales came from exclusive or proprietary products, inclusive of 26% of private label products.

In order to offer our unique collection of products and to execute a competitive merchandising and business strategy, we work to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with vendors from around the world. We believe these relationships benefit us in a number of ways, including providing us with an increased number of exclusive products and competitive pricing. We believe that by creatively crafting mutually beneficial vendor relationships, we foster a unique sense of loyalty among our more than 600 product vendors. In fact, 16 of our top 20 vendors have been with us for at least 10 years and several of those vendors have been with us since our inception in 1978. For the TCS segment, our top 10 vendors, excluding Elfa, accounted for 40% of our total purchases in fiscal 2021. In order to maximize our purchasing flexibility, we generally do not enter into long-term contracts with our vendors.

Environmental, Social and Governance
At The Container Store, we recognize the importance of our impact on people, the planet and the communities where we operate. It is imperative to the success of our business that we continue to learn, improve, and advance our vision in those key areas by implementing a strong and thoughtful ESG strategy. 
Sustainability
The Board’s role includes overseeing the Company’s corporate strategy and enterprise risk management, including sustainability efforts. Our Board and its committees play a critical role in the oversight of our corporate culture and hold management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards, governance practices and compliance programs to protect our business, employees, and reputation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our ESG efforts. Our Chief Financial Officer, a member of the executive committee, leads the ESG function. The Senior Director of ESG manages corporate sustainability activities and strategy, and reports to the Chief Financial Officer. This year, we formed a Sustainability Committee to oversee sustainable product development and materials selection. The Committee is led by the VP of Merchandising and includes members from various functions of the organization.
Our top priorities are to develop policies and programs that focus on the environment, social responsibility and our employees, respect for human rights and ethics. Our contribution to a sustainable society is to reduce environmental impact and improve our sustainable business practices to meet stakeholder demand and address growing environmental concerns and risks. In fiscal 2021, we conducted our first assessment to identify and prioritize the ESG topics most important to our business and our stakeholders. Additionally, we onboarded tools to help us measure baseline Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and energy intensity data according to the Green House Gas (“GHG”) Protocol. We continue to offset power usage in our stores, distribution centers, and support center with 100% renewable energy. 
Our Elfa-manufactured products, which contributed approximately 30% of our fiscal year 2021 retail sales, are largely made from recycled materials and Elfa has a robust sustainability program in place. 
We continue our progress towards a fair, healthy, and safe workplace, while creating work environment policies that promote diversity, equality, and inclusion. We believe that when we create a workplace where our colleagues are engaged, committed and empowered for the long-term, we are better positioned to create value for our company, as well as for our shareholders. We are proud of our focus on promoting human rights across our operations – from our supply chain to our products – and are committed to build our business on a foundation of ethics.

Human Capital Management
The Container Store was founded on basic and fundamental business philosophies about treating employees, customers, vendors, shareholders and the community with respect and dignity. It’s a culture that is driven by our seven Foundation Principles® and results in an environment where the lives of everyone connected to our business are enriched and brimming with opportunity.
Our customers consider us their happy place; and we recognize the importance of taking care of the employees who are responsible for creating this environment in our stores. That’s why we are committed to providing a robust and ongoing training and development program. Through training, we equip our team to meet the needs of our customers, whether they work in our Stores, Distribution Centers or the Support Center. Training also helps our employees become knowledgeable and trusted experts armed with intuition and trained for success. 

11



In terms of business productivity, one of our Foundation Principles, 1 Great Person = 3 Good People® is the belief that one great person with passion, perspective and a range of experiences has the energy and drive to achieve more than three good people without those traits. Our philosophy attracts other great people, making it easy to build a dedicated team who will exceed goals and create a successful work environment. Our culture shows why we hire great people from diverse backgrounds and foster an equitable, inclusive and safe environment where everyone can thrive. 
As of April 2, 2022, we had approximately 5,200 employees, of which approximately 4,800 were TCS segment employees and approximately 400 were Elfa segment employees. Of the 4,800 TCS segment employees, approximately 2,900 were part time employees. We are committed to doing everything we can, as individuals and as a company, to ensure that all of us, regardless of ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, ability, or religious affiliation have EQUAL opportunity to grow, develop and achieve our dreams.
We also know that the commitment for a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture, starts from the top, and our Chief Executive Officer, Satish Malhotra, has demonstrated his commitment by signing the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity & Inclusion (www.ceoaction.com). By taking this pledge, The Container Store has committed to actions that cultivate a trusting environment where all ideas are welcomed, and employees feel comfortable and empowered to have discussions about diversity and inclusion. These commitments include unconscious bias education, working with other companies to develop best practices, sharing our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) plans with our board of directors, as well as implementing accountability systems to track our progress. 
Our commitment to equity and inclusion extends beyond our employees. We know supporting the local communities where we have stores and distribution centers makes the communities stronger. Therefore, we are proud to offer opportunities within our supply chain to small and diverse-owned businesses and through our philanthropy efforts focus on causes that are important to our employees and customers and align with our commitment to making a lasting social and economic impact in those communities.
You can read more learn more about our DE&I efforts at www.containerstore.com/inclusion. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Rights
The Container Store recognizes the importance of protecting and advocating for human rights as our employees are our most valued asset. We are committed to ethical business practices including fair and impartial treatment of all persons regarding wages and benefits, working conditions, global labor and anti-corruption laws, and the preservation of applicable environmental standards. We strive to provide a safe, secure, and healthy environment for our employees, vendors, and customers and align our policies with guidance provided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
TCS has a zero-tolerance philosophy against modern slavery and the deprivation of a person’s liberties for personal or commercial gain. Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights that takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labor, and human trafficking. TCS is committed to eliminating acts of modern slavery from occurring within our business and will take the necessary measures to assess the effectiveness of our approach. This includes training employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management to raise awareness and help to identify victims of modern slavery. 
The Container Store will not knowingly do business with any company that engages in modern slavery or human trafficking. Our merchandise suppliers contractually agree that the finished products they sell to us, and the materials used to create them, were not produced from child or forced labor and comply with the local laws in which they operate. We conduct announced audits of select merchandise suppliers with whom we acquire goods directly from.

Health & Safety
The health and safety of The Container Store employees and customers are vital to the health of our business. We strive to minimize injury or illness, in addition to property loss or business interruption caused by accidents, fire, or other hazards. The safer our workplace is, the more efficient and profitable our company will be. 
TCS is committed to providing quality equipment, access to clean water, safe tools, and necessary protective equipment to keep employees safe. This includes providing ongoing training and the necessary resources and time required to maintain a safe place to work. 
Additionally, we expect all employees to cooperate fully with our safety measures and actively participate in helping keep each other safe. All TCS employees must recognize hazards, anticipate exposures and risks, and act to eliminate or control them. Our employees are expected to communicate with each other and our management team when unsafe acts are observed or if there is potential for an unsafe working environment. Through personal commitment and excellent communication, we strive to maintain a safe and productive place to work.
Distribution
In the TCS segment, the majority of our merchandise flows through one of our two distribution centers prior to transport to our retail stores and/or online customers. Our first distribution center is co-located with our corporate office in Coppell, Texas. The approximately 1.1 million square foot facility was designed and constructed specifically for The Container Store and is comprised of approximately 100,000 square feet of corporate office space and approximately 1 million square feet of warehouse space. Our second distribution center located in Aberdeen, Maryland is approximately 600,000 square feet and is comprised primarily of warehouse space. On December 30, 2021, as a part of the Closet Works acquisition, we added a domestic manufacturing facility in Elmhurst, Illinois.
Our distribution centers are utilized for retail store replenishment and direct-to-customer order fulfillment. We utilize third party truckload carriers to transport all of our products to our stores and major parcel carriers for direct-to-customer order deliveries. We utilize best in class logistics technology to optimize operations and current processes for receiving, picking, packing and shipping while providing a strong foundation for future growth. We continue to strengthen our distribution centers with ongoing process and material handling improvements, as well as automation, in order to achieve even greater efficiencies in service levels and inventory management.
Within our distribution operations, we have a culture of safety and efficiency, with a robust metric program and a commitment to continuous improvement. All processes, teams and individuals are held to high efficiency and performance standards. Our second distribution center improved service levels to our customers while at the same time increasing our network capacity. We also continue to invest in supply chain system enhancements for increased logistics network support.
Elfa utilizes a broad network of third-party carriers to deliver products from its manufacturing facilities to customers worldwide.
With employee safety as our top priority, our distribution centers follow all recommended guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This includes sanitizing supplies throughout both facilities and continuous communication around safety expectations. We will continue to follow local, state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of our employees.

Intellectual Property
Our “The Container Store®,” “Welcome to the OrganizationSM,” “Foundation Principles®,” “Organized InsiderSM,” “PrestonTM”, “Laren®,” “Avera®,” “Contained Home®,” and “elfa®” trademarks and certain variations thereon, such as our “The Container Store” logo and many trademarks used for our product lines and sales campaigns are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of many foreign countries. In addition, we own many domain names, including “www.containerstore.com,” “www. closets.com” and others that include our trademarks. We own several elfa® utility and design patents protecting Elfa’s closet and shelving systems, and a utility patent for TCS’s proprietary retail shopping computer systems, design patents on select private label products, along with copyrights in our catalogs, websites, and other marketing material. We believe that our trademarks, product designs and copyrighted works have significant value and we vigorously protect them against infringement.
Competition
We operate within the storage and organization category which extends across many retail segments including custom closets, housewares, and office supplies, among others. However, we are the only national retailer solely devoted to it. Storage and organization products are sold by a variety of retailers, including mass merchants, specialty retail chains, and internet-based retailers, but they devote a smaller portion of their overall merchandise assortment to storage and organization. We also compete within a highly fragmented custom closets market with national, regional and local custom closet competitors, as well as local homebuilders and contractors. One of our biggest differentiators is that we sell solutions, not items. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than The Container Store. However, we compete based on our customer service, product selection and quality, price, convenience, consumer marketing and promotional activities, and our ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences, vendor relationships, and brand recognition, among other things. In addition, we believe that the strength of our solutions-based selling with highly trained employees, exclusive offerings and vendor relationships, our passionate and loyal customer base and the quality, differentiation and breadth of our product assortment compare favorably to those of our competitors.
Seasonality
Our storage and organization product and services offering makes us less susceptible to holiday season shopping patterns than many retailers. Prior to fiscal 2021, our business realized a higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. However, in fiscal 2021, sales and profitability did not follow historical patterns due to various factors, including changes in promotional strategy and cadence. For fiscal 2022, we expect that our sales and profitability patterns will be largely consistent with fiscal 2021. 
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, environmental and other laws, including tax and trade policies and consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. Any legal or regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers, such as the imposition of potential additional tariffs or retaliatory trade restrictions in connection with U.S. trade actions, could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations.

The Company has been monitoring guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local, state, and federal health officials, as well as local, state and federal mandates, and intends to continue to follow recommended mandates and protocols while operating its business.
