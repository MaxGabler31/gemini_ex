 Item 1. Business
 THE COMPANY
 Overview
 Loral Space & Communications Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Loral,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us”), is a leading satellite communications company engaged, through our ownership interests in affiliates, in satellite-based communications services. Satellite Services
 Loral has one operating segment consisting of satellite-based communications services. Loral participates in satellite services operations primarily through its ownership interest in Telesat Canada (“Telesat”), a leading global satellite operator. Telesat provides its satellite and communication services from a fleet of satellites that occupy Canadian and other orbital locations. Loral held a 62.7% economic interest and a 32.6% voting interest in Telesat as of December 31, 2018.
 Telesat owns and leases a satellite fleet that operates in geostationary orbit approximately 22,000 miles above the equator. In this orbit, satellites remain in a fixed position relative to points on the earth’s surface and provide reliable, high-bandwidth services anywhere in their coverage areas, serving as the backbone for many forms of telecommunications. Telesat is also developing a global constellation of low earth orbit (“LEO”) satellites. LEO satellites operate in a circular orbit around the earth with an altitude typically between 500 and 870 miles. Unlike geostationary satellites that operate in a fixed orbital location above the equator, LEO satellites travel around the earth at high velocities requiring antennas on the ground to track their movement. LEO satellite systems have the potential to offer a number of advantages over geostationary satellites to meet growing requirements for broadband services, both consumer and commercial, by providing increased data speeds and capacity, global coverage, and latency on par with or potentially better than terrestrial services.
 At December 31, 2018, Telesat, with approximately $2.7 billion of backlog, provided satellite services to customers from its fleet of 17 in-orbit geostationary satellites, including Telstar 18 VANTAGE and Telstar 19 VANTAGE which were successfully launched in the third quarter of 2018. Telesat also owns the Canadian Ka-band payload on the ViaSat‑1 satellite and manages the operations of additional satellites for third parties. In January 2018, Telesat launched a Ka-band satellite into low earth orbit as part of its plan to deploy a high capacity LEO constellation that is expected to deliver low latency, fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide.
     Telesat provides video distribution and direct-to-home (“DTH”) video, as well as end-to-end communications services using both satellite and hybrid satellite-ground networks.
 Telesat Services
 Telesat earns the majority of its revenues by providing satellite-based services to customers, who use these services for their own communications requirements or to provide services to customers further down the distribution chain for video and data services. Telesat also earns revenue by providing ground-based transmit and receive services, selling equipment, installing, managing and maintaining satellite networks, and providing consulting services in the field of satellite communications. Telesat categorizes its revenues into: Broadcast, Enterprise, and Consulting and Other. Broadcast
 Telesat’s broadcast services business provided approximately 50% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These services include:
 DTH:  Both Canadian DTH service providers (Bell TV and Shaw Direct) use Telesat’s satellites as a distribution platform for their services, delivering television programming, audio and information channels directly to customers’ homes. In addition, Telesat’s satellites are used by EchoStar/DISH Network for DTH services in the United States.

 Video distribution and contribution:  Broadcasters, cable networks and DTH service providers use Telesat satellites for the full-time transmission of television programming. Additionally, Telesat provides certain broadcasters and DTH service providers bundled value-added services that include satellite capacity, digital encoding of video channels, authorization services and uplinking and downlinking services to and from Telesat satellites and earth station facilities.
 Occasional use services:  Occasional use services consist of satellite transmission services for the timely broadcast of video news, sports and live event coverage on a short-term basis enabling broadcasters to conduct on-the-scene transmissions using small, portable antennas.
 Enterprise
 Telesat’s enterprise services provided approximately 48% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These services include:
 Telecommunication carrier and integrator services:  Telesat provides satellite capacity and end-to-end services for data and voice transmission to telecommunications carriers and integrators located throughout the world. These services include space segment services and terrestrial facilities for broadband, internet backhaul, cellular backhaul and services such as rural telephony to telecommunications carriers and network services integrators around the world.
 Government services: The United States government is the largest single consumer of fixed satellite services in the world and a user of Telesat’s international satellites. Telesat provides services to the United States government through government service integrators, rather than directly to United States government agencies. Telesat is also a significant provider of satellite services to the Canadian government.
 Broadband services: Telesat provides Ka-band satellite capacity to customers in Canada, primarily to Bell Canada subsidiary Northwestel, which uses it to enhance broadband connectivity for all 25 communities in Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost territory and to Xplornet Communications Inc., which uses it to provide two-way broadband internet services and in the United States to ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”), which uses it to provide similar services. Telesat also provides Ka-band and Ku-band satellite capacity to Hughes Network Systems LLC (“HNS”), which uses it to provide two-way broadband internet services in South America. 
 Resource services: Telesat provides communications services to geographically diverse locations, both on and off shore, for the oil and gas and mining industries.
 Maritime and aeronautical services: Telesat is increasingly providing satellite capacity to customers serving the growing maritime and aeronautical markets bringing broadband communications services to commercial airplanes and vessels.
 Retail services: Telesat operates VSAT and hybrid VSAT/terrestrial networks in Canada providing end-to-end services including installation and maintenance of the end user terminal, maintenance of the VSAT hub and provision of satellite capacity. These networks include the support of point-of-sale and other applications at thousands of retail petroleum sites.
 Satellite operator services: Telesat provides services to other satellite operators in the form of partial channel satellite capacity, full transponder satellite capacity and, on occasion, the relocation and use of an entire satellite at a designated orbital location to preserve their spectrum rights.
 Consulting and Other
 Telesat’s consulting and other category provided approximately 2% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Telesat’s consulting operations allow it to realize operating efficiencies by leveraging Telesat’s existing employees and the facility base dedicated to its core satellite communication business. With almost 50 years of engineering and technical experience, Telesat is a leading consultant in establishing, operating and upgrading satellite systems worldwide.

 Competitive Strengths
 Telesat’s business is characterized by the following key competitive strengths:
 Leading Global FSS Operator
 Telesat is one of the world’s leading fixed satellite services (“FSS”) operators and the largest in Canada. It has a leading position as a provider of satellite services in the North American video distribution market. Telesat provides services to both of the major DTH providers in Canada, Bell TV and Shaw Direct, which together have approximately two million subscribers, as well as to EchoStar (DISH Network) in the United States, which has approximately 10.3 million subscribers. Its international satellites are well positioned to serve a number of growing markets and serve a range of important customers in those markets. Blue Chip Customer Base
 Telesat offers its broad suite of satellite services to more than 400 customers worldwide, which include some of the world’s leading DTH service providers, ISPs, network services integrators, telecommunications carriers, corporations and government agencies. Over almost 50 years of operation, Telesat has established long-term, collaborative relationships with its customers and has developed a reputation for creating innovative solutions and providing services essential for its customers to reach their end users. Telesat’s customers represent some of the strongest and most financially stable companies in their respective industries. A number of these customers have historically committed to long-term contracts for Telesat’s services, which enhances the predictability of its future revenues and cash flows and supports its future growth. Large Contracted Backlog and Young Satellite Fleet Underpin Anticipated Growth and High Revenue Visibility
 Historically, Telesat has been able to generate strong cash flows from its operating activities due to the high operating margins in the satellite industry and its disciplined control of expenses. The stability of Telesat’s cash flows is underpinned by its large revenue backlog. Telesat has been able to generate significant backlog by entering into long-term contracts with some of its customers, in some cases for all or substantially all of a satellite’s orbital maneuver life. Historically, this has resulted in revenue from the satellite services business being fairly predictable.
 Many of Telesat’s satellites are relatively new and will not need to be replaced for a significant period of time, which defers replacement capital expenditures.
 Portfolio of Orbital Real Estate
 Telesat’s satellites occupy highly attractive orbital locations that provide it with an advantageous position in the markets in which it operates due to the scarcity of available satellite spectrum and the strong neighborhoods Telesat has developed at these locations. Access to these orbital locations, coupled with the high capital intensity of the satellite industry, creates barriers to entry in those markets. Telesat is licensed by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (“ISED”) to occupy a number of key orbital locations that are well-suited to serve the Americas and support its leading position in North America. Telesat’s international satellites also occupy highly desirable orbital locations that enable broad pan-regional service with interconnectivity between regions, making them attractive for both intra- and inter-regional services. Telesat has rights to additional spectrum, including at certain existing orbital locations.
 Telesat also has rights to use Ka-band and V-band to operate a global LEO satellite constellation. LEO satellite systems have the potential to offer a number of advantages over geostationary satellites to meet growing requirements for broadband services by providing increased data speeds and capacity, global coverage, and latency on par with or potentially better than terrestrial services. Telesat’s ﬁrst LEO satellite was launched in January 2018 and is being used to support live demonstrations of certain features of Telesat’s LEO system design with existing Telesat customers and potential suppliers of Telesat LEO system hardware. These satellite leaders will be able to experience key advantages of Telesat’s LEO system – including ultra-low latency and high speeds – and assess the role Telesat’s constellation can play in their next-generation broadband networks.

 Global Operations Provide Revenue Diversification and Economies of Scale
 The combination of Telesat’s North American broadcast and enterprise services businesses and Telesat’s international business offers diversity in terms of both the customers and regions served as well as the services provided.
 Moreover, as the operator of a fleet of 17 geostationary satellites plus multiple other satellites for third parties, Telesat has attained meaningful scale to allow it to leverage its relatively fixed cost base to achieve substantial operating margins.
 Business Strategy
 Telesat’s commitment to providing strong customer service and its focus on innovation and technical expertise has allowed it to successfully build its business to date. Building on its existing contractual revenue backlog, Telesat will continue to focus on increasing the utilization of its existing satellite capacity, maintaining its operating efficiency and, in a disciplined manner, using its strong cash flow to grow in-orbit satellite capacity and strengthen its business.
     Telesat believes its satellite fleet offers a strong combination of existing backlog and available capacity that provides a solid foundation upon which it will seek to grow its revenue and cash flows. To achieve this growth, Telesat will seek to capture the anticipated increased demand for satellite services and capacity, particularly in the enterprise services market, from requirements such as maritime and aeronautical, government services and supporting carrier and enterprise networks.
     Telesat will continue to focus on capturing the anticipated increase in worldwide demand for satellite services through a disciplined satellite expansion program that should drive incremental contracted backlog and cash flows, and further leverage its fixed cost structure. 
     In 2018, Telesat launched two new geostationary satellites:
     Telstar 18 VANTAGE, a powerful, state-of-the-art, multi-mission satellite was successfully launched in September 2018 to replace Telstar 18 at 138° EL. This new satellite replaces and expands on Telesat’s Telstar 18 satellite through extensive C-band capacity over Asia, Ku-band high throughput spot beams over Indonesia and Malaysia, and five additional regional Ku-band beams. Telstar 18 VANTAGE’s innovative Ku-band payloads of high throughput spot beams and focused regional beams provide customers operating in Mongolia, Indochina, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand and the Pacific Ocean with greater choice and flexibility in deploying high performing broadband networks. Telesat’s long-standing partner at the 138° EL location, APT, will use 57.5% of the satellite’s capacity in exchange for providing 57.5% of the capital for the satellite program.
     Telstar 19 VANTAGE, a powerful, multi-mission, high throughput satellite was successfully launched in July 2018, bringing additional capacity to the 63° WL orbital location where Telesat operates its Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 satellite. The satellite offers a high degree of flexibility with coverage of Brazil, the Andean region, the Caribbean, the North Atlantic Ocean and Northern Canada. HNS has entered into a long-term contract for Telstar 19 VANTAGE Ka-band capacity to expand its broadband satellite services for consumers and businesses in South America. Telesat also has long term contracts for the entire Ka-band capacity of Telstar 19 VANTAGE over Northern Canada, including providing Bell Canada subsidiary Northwestel with the high throughput spot beam capacity required to enhance broadband capacity for all 25 communities in Nunavut, Canada’s northernmost territory. 
     Telesat will continue to advance its LEO constellation plans. In January 2018, Telesat successfully launched its first LEO satellite, an important milestone in its development of a state-of-the-art, high capacity LEO constellation that will deliver transformative, fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide. This Phase 1 LEO satellite is now demonstrating certain features of Telesat’s LEO system design, in particular the capability of the satellite and customer terminals to deliver a low-latency broadband experience. Telesat has installed ground infrastructure at its teleport in Allan Park in Canada to support testing with existing customers and potential suppliers of Telesat LEO system hardware who have been participating in trials since the second half of 2018. In July and August 2018, Telesat entered into agreements with two leading satellite manufacturing teams, Airbus Defence and Space and a consortium of Thales Alenia Space and Maxar Technologies, to further develop systems designs for Telesat’s LEO constellation. The two teams will complete their preliminary designs, address key hardware and software development items, and perform a series of technical reviews. Later in 2019, Telesat expects to receive firm proposals for manufacture and launch support of Telesat’s LEO satellites and deployment of the ground system infrastructure.

 Competition
 Telesat is a leading global FSS operator in a highly competitive industry, and Telesat competes against other global, regional and national satellite operators and with providers of terrestrial-based communications services. Fixed Satellite Operators
 Other global satellite operators are Intelsat S.A. (“Intelsat”), SES S.A. (“SES”), Eutelsat S.A. (“Eutelsat”) and Inmarsat. Telesat also competes with a number of nationally or regionally focused FSS operators around the world.
 Intelsat, SES and Eutelsat are each substantially larger than Telesat in terms of both the number of satellites they have in-orbit as well as their revenues. Telesat believes that Intelsat and its subsidiaries and SES and its subsidiaries each have global fleets of over 50 satellites, and that Eutelsat and its subsidiaries have a fleet of almost 40 satellites. Due to their larger sizes, these operators may be able to take advantage of greater economies of scale, may be more attractive to customers, and may (depending on the specific satellite and orbital location in question) have greater flexibility to restore service to their customers in the event of a partial or total satellite failure. In addition, their larger sizes may enable them to devote more resources, both human and financial, to sales, operations, product development and strategic alliances and acquisitions.
 Regional and domestic providers: Telesat also competes against regional FSS operators, including:

· | in North America: Ciel, ViaSat, HNS/EchoStar, Hispasat and Arsat;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in Europe, Middle East, Africa: Avanti, Arabsat, Es’hailsat, Nilesat, Gazprom, Hellas Sat, RSCC, Yahsat, Turksat and Spacecom;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in Asia: AsiaSat, Measat, Thaicom, APT, PT Telkom, Optus, SKY Perfect JSAT and Asia Broadcast Satellite; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | in Latin America: Star One, Arsat and Hispamar.
--+------------------------------------------------

  A number of other countries have domestic satellite systems against which Telesat competes in those markets.
 The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators as part of its 1998 World Trade Organization commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services. As of January 2019, approximately 90 non-Canadian licensed geostationary satellites and non-geostationary satellite constellations are listed as having been approved for use in Canada. Four of these geostationary satellites are Telesat satellites licensed by other administrations and one is a satellite on which Telesat owns the Canadian-coverage capacity.
 In addition, the FSS and the mobile satellite services (“MSS”) sectors, which have historically served distinct customer requirements, are converging. As a result, Telesat faces competition from MSS operators that include Inmarsat, which offers a high throughput Ka-band service using a global constellation of four geostationary satellites. The growth in satellite service providers using or planning to use Ka-band, including Avanti Communications, SES/O3b, ViaSat, Eutelsat, HNS/Echostar, Inmarsat, SES, Yahsat and others, will result in increased competition.
 Many of the new and replacement satellites expected to be deployed in the near term will be high throughput satellites or will include high throughput payloads. In addition, second generation high throughput satellite systems recently launched and in development purport to be capable of throughput that substantially exceeds the throughput of first generation high throughput satellites. This is expected to result in a significant increase in satellite capacity which may further increase competition.
 Over the past few years, in addition to Telesat’s LEO constellation, a number of other global non-geostationary orbit (“NGSO”) satellite systems have been announced and are now in various stages of development. These include proposed systems from One Web, SpaceX, SES/O3b and LeoSat, among others. In addition, a number of other non-terrestrial systems using drones or balloons have also been announced. As these new systems are deployed they may significantly increase the supply of services that will compete with Telesat’s LEO constellation as well as traditional satellite services.

 Terrestrial Service Providers
 Providers of terrestrial-based communications services compete with satellite operators. Increasingly, in developed and developing countries alike, governments are providing funding and other incentives to encourage the expansion of terrestrial networks resulting in increased competition for satellite operators. Consulting Services
 The market for satellite consulting services is generally comprised of a few companies qualified to provide advice to governments, satellite operators, spacecraft manufacturers and other industry participants on a range of technical and commercial matters related to satellite communications and earth observation. Telesat’s competitors are primarily United States and European-based companies. Satellite Fleet & Ground Resources
 Telesat’s state-of-the art satellite ﬂeet is comprised of 17 geostationary satellites offering global coverage with a concentration over the Americas. Telesat’s Nimiq 1 and Nimiq 2 satellites are primarily used to provide short-term services to other operators who use the satellites at their designated orbital locations to preserve their spectrum rights. 
 In January 2018, Telesat launched a Ka-band satellite into low earth orbit as part of a plan to deploy a high capacity LEO constellation that is expected to deliver low latency, fiber-like broadband to commercial and government users worldwide. 
 Telesat operates an extensive ground infrastructure, including a satellite control center (“SCC”) in Ottawa, Ontario, its main earth station and backup SCC at Allan Park, Ontario, nine earth stations throughout Canada, one teleport located in the United States and one in Brazil. These ground facilities are used for controlling Telesat’s satellites and for the provision of end-to-end services to Telesat’s customers.

(1) | Telesat’s current estimate of when each satellite will be decommissioned, taking account of anomalies and malfunctions the satellites have experienced to date and other factors such as remaining fuel levels, consumption rates and other available engineering data. These estimates are subject to change and it is possible that the actual orbital maneuver life of any of these satellites will be shorter than Telesat currently anticipates. Further, it is anticipated that the payload capacity of each satellite may be reduced prior to the estimated end of orbital maneuver life. For example, Telesat currently anticipates that it will need to commence the turndown of transponders on Anik F1 prior to the end of orbital maneuver life as a result of further degradation in available power.

(3) | 54% of the transponders on the satellite are leased to APT (the “APT transponders”), through the end of life of the satellite in consideration for APT’s funding a portion of the satellite’s cost. This transaction was accounted for as a sales-type lease, because substantially all of the benefits and risks incident to the ownership of the leased transponders were transferred to APT. Telesat has agreed with APT among other things that, if Telesat is able to obtain the necessary approvals and licenses from the U.S. government under U.S. export laws, it would transfer title to the APT transponders on Telstar 18 to APT, as well as a corresponding interest in the elements on the satellite that are common to or shared by the APT transponders and the Telesat transponders. Telesat acquired two transponders from APT for an additional payment in August 2009.

  In addition, Telesat has rights to satellite capacity on other satellites including the Ka-band Canadian payload consisting of nine user beams on ViaSat‑1.
 Telesat is currently evaluating mission extension services that have the potential to prolong the orbital maneuver lives of certain of its satellites. However, there can be no assurance that Telesat will contract for the use of these mission extension services or that, if it does so, the services will be successful.

  Total Telesat assets were $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in total assets from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 is primarily the result of the change in foreign exchange rates. Backlog was approximately $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in backlog is due to revenues recognized and exchange rate changes, partially offset by new orders. It is expected that approximately 20% of the backlog at December 31, 2018 will be recognized as revenue by Telesat in 2019.

 Other
 We also own 56% of XTAR, LLC (“XTAR”), a joint venture between Loral and Hisdesat Servicios Estrategicos S.A. (“Hisdesat”) of Spain. We account for our ownership interest in XTAR under the equity method of accounting because we do not control certain of its significant operating decisions. XTAR owns and operates an X-band satellite, XTAR-EUR located at 29˚ EL, which entered service in March 2005. The satellite is designed to provide X-band communications services exclusively to United States, Spanish and allied government users throughout the satellite’s coverage area, including Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The government of Spain granted XTAR rights to an X-band license, normally reserved for government and military use, to develop a commercial business model for supplying X-band capacity in support of military, diplomatic and security communications requirements. XTAR also leases 7.2 72 MHz X-band transponders (subject to certain temporary reductions for 2018) on the Spainsat satellite located at 30˚ WL owned by Hisdesat, which entered commercial service in April 2006. These transponders, designated as XTAR-LANT, allow XTAR to provide its customers in the U.S. and abroad with additional X-band services and greater flexibility. XTAR currently has contracts to provide satellite telecommunication services to various agencies of the United States, Spanish and other European governments. For more information on XTAR see Note 5 to the Loral consolidated financial statements. REGULATION
 Telesat is subject to regulation by government authorities in Canada, the United States and other countries in which it operates and is subject to the frequency coordination process of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”). Telesat’s ability to provide satellite services in a particular country or region is subject also to the technical constraints of its satellites, international coordination, local regulation including as it applies to securing landing rights and licensing requirements. Canadian Regulatory Environment
 Telesat was originally established by the government of Canada in 1969 under the Telesat Canada Act. As part of the Canadian government’s divestiture of its shares in Telesat, pursuant to the Telesat Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act (1991), or the Telesat Divestiture Act, Telesat was continued on March 27, 1992 as a business corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Telesat Canada Act was repealed and the Canadian government sold its shares in Telesat. The Telesat Divestiture Act provides that no legislation relating to the solvency or winding-up of a corporation applies to Telesat and that its affairs cannot be wound up unless authorized by an Act of Parliament. In addition, Telesat and its shareholders and directors cannot apply for Telesat’s continuation in another jurisdiction or dissolution unless authorized by an Act of Parliament.
 Telesat is a Canadian carrier under the Telecommunications Act (Canada), or the Telecom Act. The Telecom Act authorizes the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (“CRTC”) to regulate various aspects of the provision of telecommunications services by Telesat and other telecommunications service providers. Telesat is currently not subject to detailed rate regulation; the CRTC has, however, retained its powers under the Telecom Act to impose price regulation or other regulatory measures on Telesat in the future, as necessary. In addition, Section 28(2) of the Telecom Act provides that the CRTC may allocate satellite capacity to particular broadcasting undertakings if it is satisfied that the allocation will further the implementation of the broadcasting policy for Canada. The exercise by the CRTC of its rights under section 28(2) of the Telecommunications Act could affect Telesat’s relationship with existing customers, which could have a material adverse effect on Telesat’s results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.
 Telesat’s operations are also subject to regulation and licensing by ISED (formerly Industry Canada) pursuant to the Radiocommunication Act (Canada). ISED has the authority to issue spectrum and earth station licenses and establish policies and standards related to the radio frequencies upon which Telesat’s satellites and earth stations depend. The Minister responsible for ISED has broad discretion in exercising this authority to issue licenses, fix and amend conditions of licenses and to suspend or even revoke them. Some of the spectrum licenses under which Telesat operates the Anik and Nimiq satellites require Telesat to comply with research and development and other industrial and public benefit commitments, to pay annual spectrum license fees and to provide all-Canada satellite coverage.

 ISED traditionally licensed satellite radio spectrum using a competitive licensing process. In 2012, ISED conducted a public consultation on the licensing framework for FSS and broadcast satellite services (“BSS”) in Canada. As a result of the consultation, changes in policy were announced in November 2013. Effective January 6, 2014, all FSS and BSS licenses are awarded to qualified applicants on a first-come, first-served basis and spectrum licenses have replaced radio licenses. The term of spectrum licenses is 20 years, with a high expectation of renewal. ISED may, however, issue licenses with a shorter term. Satellite and terrestrial operators are seeking additional spectrum to accommodate the expected growth in demand for broadband services and 5G networks. ISED is considering and may adopt new spectrum allocations for terrestrial services that require satellite operators to vacate or share spectrum and may limit the spectrum that is available for satellite services.
     The Canadian government opened Canadian satellite markets to foreign satellite operators as part of its 1998 World Trade Organization (“WTO”) commitments to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications services, with the exception of DTH television services provided through FSS or DBS facilities. Satellite digital audio radio service markets were also closed to foreign entry until 2005. In September 2005, the Canadian government revised its satellite-use policy to permit the use of foreign-licensed satellites for digital audio radio services in Canada. Further liberalization of the policy may occur and could result in increased competition in Canadian satellite markets.
     Since November 2000, pursuant to the CRTC’s Decision CRTC 2000‑745, virtually all telecommunications service providers are required to pay contribution charges based on their Canadian telecommunications service revenues, minus certain deductions (e.g., terminal equipment sales and inter-carrier payments). The contribution rate varies from year to year. It was initially set at 4.5% of eligible revenues but was significantly reduced in subsequent years. The rate for 2018 was 0.54%, and an interim rate of 0.60% has been established by the CRTC for 2019.
     United States Regulatory Environment
     The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates the provision of satellite services to, from, or within the United States.
     Telesat has chosen to operate its U.S. licensed satellites, Telstar 11N, Telstar 12 and Telstar 12 VANTAGE, on a non-common carrier basis. Consequently, it is not subject to rate regulation or other common carrier regulations enacted under the Communications Act of 1934. Telesat pays FCC filing fees in connection with its space station and earth station applications and annual fees to defray the FCC’s regulatory expenses. Annual and quarterly status reports must be filed with the Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) covering interstate/international telecommunications revenues. Based on these reports, USAC assesses Telesat for contribution to the FCC’s Universal Service Fund (“USF”). Payments to the USF are made on a quarterly and annual basis. The USF contribution rate is adjusted quarterly and is proposed to be set at 20% for the first quarter of 2019. At the present time, the FCC does not assess USF contributions with respect to bare transponder capacity (i.e. agreements for space segment only). Telesat’s United States telecom revenues that are subject to USF contribution requirements are currently small and its USF payments are not material.
     Telesat also owns and operates the portion of the ViaSat‑1 satellite (115o WL) payload that is capable of providing service within Canada. The ViaSat‑1 satellite is licensed by the United States.
     The FCC currently grants geostationary-like satellite authorizations on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants which demonstrate that they are legally and technically qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. In contrast, applications for non-geostationary-like satellite authorizations are dealt with through processing rounds, initiated by public notice or the submission of a lead application. Under licensing and market access rules, a bond must be posted starting at $1 million when a geostationary satellite or non-geostationary satellite constellation authorization is granted and escalating to up to $3 million in the case of a geostationary satellite and $5 million in the case of a non-geostationary satellite constellation. The entire amount of the bond may be forfeited if there is a failure to meet the FCC’s milestones for the launch and commencement of operations of the geostationary satellite or the milestones for the deployment and operation of 50% of the satellites in a non-geostationary satellite constellation. According to current licensing rules, the FCC will issue new satellite licenses for an initial 15‑year term and will provide a licensee with an “expectancy” that a subsequent license will be granted for the replacement of an authorized satellite using the same frequencies. At the end of the 15‑year term, a satellite that has not been replaced, or that has been relocated to another orbital location following its replacement, may be allowed to continue operations for a limited period of time subject to certain restrictions. As in other jurisdictions, the FCC is considering and may adopt new spectrum allocations for terrestrial mobile broadband and 5G, including in bands that are currently allocated to satellite services. New spectrum allocations may require satellite operators to vacate or share spectrum and may limit the spectrum that is available for satellite services.

 To facilitate the provision of FSS in C-, Ku-, Ka- and V-band frequencies in the United States market, foreign licensed operators can apply to have their satellites either placed on the FCC’s Permitted Space Station List (for certain frequencies) or be granted a declaratory ruling (for other frequencies). The bond and milestone requirements for U.S.-licensed satellites apply equally to authorized foreign-licensed satellites. Telesat’s Anik Fl, Anik FlR, Anik F2, Anik F3, Telstar 14R/Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites and Telesat’s Ka- and V-band LEO constellations are currently authorized to serve the U.S. market in accordance with these procedures.
 The United States made no WTO commitment to open its DTH, DBS or digital audio radio services to foreign competition, and instead indicated that provision of these services by foreign operators would be considered on a case-by-case basis, based on an evaluation of the effective competitive opportunities open to United States operators in the country in which the foreign satellite was licensed (i.e., an ECO-sat test) as well as other public interest criteria. While Canada currently does not satisfy the ECO-sat test in the case of DTH and DBS service, the FCC has found, in a number of cases, that provision of these services into the United States using Canadian-licensed satellites would provide significant public interest benefits and would therefore be allowed. In cases involving Telesat, United States service providers, Digital Broadband Applications Corp., DIRECTV and EchoStar, have all received FCC approval to access Canadian-authorized satellites under Telesat’s direction and control in Canadian-licensed orbital locations to provide DTH-FSS or DBS service into the United States.
 The approval of the FCC for the acquisition of our ownership interest in Telesat was conditioned upon compliance by Telesat with commitments made to the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security relating to the availability of certain records and communications in the United States in response to lawful United States law enforcement requests for such access.
 The export of United States-manufactured satellites and technical information related to satellites, earth station equipment and provision of services to certain countries are subject to State Department, Commerce Department and Treasury Department regulations.
 In 1999, the United States State Department published amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) which included satellites on the list of items requiring export licenses. Effective November 2014, further amendments to the ITAR transferred jurisdiction of certain satellites and related technology to the Export Administration Regulations administered by the Commerce Department, which also impose license requirements in specified circumstances. These ITAR provisions may limit Telesat’s access to certain technical information and may have a negative impact on Telesat’s international consulting revenues.
 Regulation Outside Canada and the United States
 The Brazilian national telecommunications agency, ANATEL, grants exploitation rights for Brazilian satellites to companies incorporated and existing in Brazil which participate in specific auctions conducted by ANATEL and which demonstrate that they are legally, technically and financially qualified and that the public interest will be served by the grant. ANATEL may also grant exploitation and landing rights for foreign satellites when the public interest is evidenced, provided that the applicant company provides certain specific technical information on the relevant satellite and appoints a legal representative in Brazil (i.e., a company incorporated and existing in Brazil). The landing rights of foreign satellites are granted to the owner of the space segment or the company which holds the right to operate it, in whole or in part, but the satellite capacity may only be sold or negotiated in Brazil through the local legal representative. In exploitation and landing rights of Brazilian and foreign satellites, the rights are granted on an onerous basis and are valid for 15 years for Brazilian satellites (renewable once for an additional 15 years) and up to 15 years for foreign satellites (renewable once for an additional equal period).
 ANATEL has authorized Telesat, through its subsidiary, Telesat Brasil Capacidade de Satélites Ltda. (“TBCS”), to operate a Ku-band FSS satellite at the 63° WL orbital location. In December 2008, TBCS entered into a new 15‑year Concession Agreement with ANATEL which obligates TBCS to operate the satellite in accordance with Brazilian telecommunications law and contains provisions to enable ANATEL to levy fines for failure to perform according to the Concession Agreement terms.
 In May 2015, TBCS was the successful bidder in an ANATEL auction for Ka-Band and planned Ku-band frequency rights at the 63° WL orbital location, and the associated 15‑year Concession Agreements were signed in March 2016. Telesat’s Estrela do Sul 2 and Telstar 19 VANTAGE satellites are located at 63° WL and make use of these frequency rights.

 
  13

 

 In addition, ANATEL has accredited TBCS as legal representative in Brazil of three non-Brazilian satellites; Telstar 12 VANTAGE, Anik F1 and Anik G1.
 Telesat owns Telstar 18 and its replacement, Telstar 18 VANTAGE, which currently operate at the 138° EL orbital location under an agreement with APT. APT has been granted the right to use the C- and Ku-band frequencies at the 138° EL orbital location by The Kingdom of Tonga. APT is the direct interface with the Tonga regulatory bodies. Because Telesat gained access to this orbital location through APT, there is greater uncertainty with respect to its ability to maintain access to this orbital location and the frequencies. Telstar 18 VANTAGE also includes Ka-band frequencies that operate under rights provided to Telesat by the United Kingdom.
 Telesat owns and operates the portion of the ViaSat‑1 satellite (115˚ WL) payload that is capable of providing service within Canada. ViaSat‑1 operates in accordance with a license granted by the FCC in the United States. However, by virtue of an intergovernmental arrangement between the United States and the United Kingdom, ViaSat‑1 operates in accordance with ITU networks filed by the United Kingdom regulatory agency, OFCOM, on behalf of the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is a British Crown Dependency and Isle of Man satellite frequency filings are filed with the ITU by OFCOM. ManSat Ltd. (“ManSat”) has been granted rights by the Isle of Man government to manage all aspects of Isle of Man satellite frequency filings. Both Telesat and ViaSat have a commercial relationship with ManSat. ViaSat and Telesat have agreed to cooperate in their dealings with ManSat with respect to the ViaSat‑1 satellite for OFCOM and ITU purposes. The Ka-band and portions of the Ku-band frequencies on Telstar 12 VANTAGE, portions of the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 18 VANTAGE and the Ka-band frequencies on Telstar 19 VANTAGE are also filed with the ITU by ManSat on behalf of Telesat.
 Landing Rights and Other Regulatory Requirements
 Many countries regulate satellite transmission signals to, and for uplink signals from, their territory. Telesat has landing rights in major market countries worldwide. In many jurisdictions, landing rights are granted on a per satellite basis and applications must be made to secure landing rights on replacement satellites. International Regulatory Environment — International Telecommunication Union
 The ITU, a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for administering access by member states to frequencies in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The ITU Radio Regulations set forth the process that member states must follow to secure rights for satellites to use frequencies and the obligations and restrictions that govern such use. The process includes, for example, a “first-come, first-served” system for gaining access to certain frequencies and time limits for bringing the frequencies into use. Other frequencies at specified orbital locations have been reserved in perpetuity for individual administrations’ use.
 Canada, the United States and other member states have rights to use certain frequencies. Telesat has been authorized by its ITU filing administrators (Canada, USA, Brazil and United Kingdom) to use certain frequencies. In addition, through commercial arrangements, Telesat has the right to use certain frequencies for which the Kingdom of Tonga has the rights. Authorized frequencies include those already used by its current satellites, and additional frequencies at various geostationary orbital locations or in non-geostationary constellations that must be brought into use within specified time limits.
 The ITU Radio Regulations govern the process used by satellite operators to coordinate their operations with other satellite operators to avoid harmful interference. Each member state is required to give notice of, coordinate, and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments with the ITU. The filing and registration process is administered by the ITU Radiocommunications Bureau (the “ITU-BR”).


 
  14

 

 Once a member state has filed with the ITU its proposed use of frequencies, other member states inform that member state and the ITU-BR of any intended use that has the potential to cause interference to either existing operations, or operations that may occur in accordance with priority rights. The member states are then obligated to negotiate with each other in an effort to coordinate the proposed uses and resolve interference concerns. If all outstanding issues are resolved in accordance with the various procedures of the ITU Radio Regulations, the frequencies are entered into the ITU’s Master Register (“MIFR”). Registered frequencies are entitled under international law to interference protection from subsequent or nonconforming uses.
 Under the ITU Radio Regulations, a member state that places a satellite or any ground station into operation without completing coordination could be vulnerable to interference from other systems and may have to alter the operating parameters of its satellite or ground station if harmful interference occurs to other users already entered in the MIFR or that have priority rights.
 The process of ITU filing and notification in the MIFR of frequencies spans a period of seven to eight years, or longer, depending upon the frequency band and the various provisions of the ITU Radio Regulations that may be invoked. Telesat’s authorized frequencies are in various stages of the coordination and notification process. Many frequencies have completed the process and have been registered in the MIFR. In other cases, coordination is on-going so that entry into the MIFR is pending. This is typical for satellite operators. Depending upon the outcome of coordination discussions with other satellite operators Telesat may need to make concessions in terms of how a frequency may be used. This, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on Telesat’s financial condition, as well as on the value of its business. The failure to reach an appropriate arrangement with such satellite operators may render it impossible to secure entry into the MIFR and result in substantial restrictions on the use and operations of Telesat’s existing satellites. In the event disputes arise during the coordination process or thereafter, the ITU Radio Regulations set forth procedures for resolving disputes but do not contain a mandatory dispute resolution mechanism or an enforcement mechanism. Rather, the rules invite a consensual dispute resolution process for parties to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Neither the rules nor international law provide a clear remedy for a party where this voluntary process fails.
 The ITU is considering and may adopt at the World Radio Conference in November 2019, new international spectrum allocations to terrestrial mobile, satellite and other services. New international spectrum allocations may require satellite operators to vacate or share spectrum and may limit the spectrum that is available for satellite services. Although non-governmental entities, including Telesat, participate at the ITU, only national administrations have full standing as ITU members. Consequently, Telesat must ultimately rely on the administrations of Canada, the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Tonga to represent its interests, including submitting and coordinating the ITU satellite networks that provide frequency information within the ITU process described above.
 Some of the international and domestic regulations governing NGSO satellites are undergoing revision or have yet to be established. Both Canada and the U.S. have recently adopted new deployment milestones for NGSO systems and the ITU is expected to adopt new deployment milestones for the maintenance of international NGSO filings at the World Radio Conference in November 2019. New international milestones could limit Telesat’s ability to maintain international priority rights for its planned LEO constellation. In addition, while the international rules governing coordination between Ka-band NGSO satellite systems are established and rely on international filing date priority, the US has adopted a different approach to NGSO-NGSO coordination that requires band splitting if NGSO operators are unable to reach a coordination agreement. As a result, the amount of spectrum that may be available to Telesat’s planned LEO constellation in the U.S. is uncertain. It is possible that other jurisdictions may adopt the U.S. approach to coordination between NGSO systems. Some of the spectrum utilized by Telesat’s planned LEO constellation is also allocated to terrestrial fixed and mobile services and geostationary satellite services. While jurisdictions such as the U.S. have established rules for sharing the spectrum, many jurisdictions have yet to address this issue. Telesat’s ability to use shared spectrum for its planned LEO constellation may be impacted by new rules or the absence of rules for spectrum sharing.

 PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
 As of December 31, 2018, Telesat owned 18 issued patents, five of which are in the United States. These patents expire between 2019 and 2032. Telesat also has several pending domestic and international patent applications.
 There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing pending patent applications will be issued. Moreover, there can be no assurance that infringement of existing third party patents has not occurred or will not occur. Additionally, because the patent application process is confidential, there can be no assurance that third parties, including competitors, do not have patents pending that could result in issued patents which Telesat may infringe. In such event, Telesat may be restricted from continuing the infringing activities, which could adversely affect its business, or Telesat may be required to obtain a license from a patent holder and pay royalties, which would increase the cost of doing business.
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 Telesat’s research and development expenditures are incurred for the studies associated with advanced satellite system designs and experimentation and development of space, satellite and ground communications products. This includes the development of Telesat’s planned LEO constellation. FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 Telesat’s revenues from customers in Canada, the U.S. and other geographical regions, primarily Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America and Caribbean, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are tabulated below:
