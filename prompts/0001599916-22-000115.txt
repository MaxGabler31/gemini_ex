SkyFight-X
 
SkyFight-X, which was originally developed and designed by our Chief Executive Officer, specifically for the hobbyist drone race known as “SKY FIGHT”, which is organized by Drone Net, a Japanese Company. Drone Net began running a drone school in 2017, and a drone race in 2019. Our CEO, Ryohei Uetaki, was in the planning stages of a new small sized drone product, and believed that his products would have higher performance capabilities than the drones at the time used by Drone Net, which prompted him to propose collaboration between the Company and Drone Net. Currently, Drone Net administrates 16 racetracks in Japan, specifically designed for drone use.
 
Although SkyFight-X was designed for Sky Fight, the drones can also be used outside the facilities designed exclusively for drone racing, and they can be used for recreational and miscellaneous purposes.
 
The following includes details regarding the SkyFight-X which we currently offer for sale. As mentioned later on, we have plans to expand our reach to more customers, but at this time it should be noted our only customer is Drone Net.

Structure of Operations of SkyFight-X





At present, the Company’s operations are carried out in the following manner:
 
(1) The Company receives an order for the Company’s products from Drone Net.
 
In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, entered into on March 1, 2020, Drone Net shall not develop, manufacture, purchase or sell similar products to SkyFight-X without the Company’s consent through February 28, 2023.
 
(2) The Company places orders to G-Force, Inc., a Japan corporation (“G-Force”) to manufacture the Products, in accordance with the terms outlined in the agreement entered into on March 4, 2020.
 
(3) G-Force purchases lap measuring sensors (the “Sensors”) from ShenZhen RadioMaster Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“RadioMaster”). The sensors are later installed in the SkyFight-X Drones.
 
(4) The Sensors are installed into the drones manufactured by G-Force on behalf of the Company.
 
(5) G-Force manufactures the Products and installs the Sensors. G-Force is a non-exclusive OEM supplier of the Company. After completion of the production process, the Company conducts a final product inspection of the goods produced. During the inspection, on average, the Company physically inspects between five to ten percent of the products for quality control.
 
(6) Following inspection and acceptance of the products, the Company directs G-Force to deliver the products to a location designated by Drone Net, currently the warehouse of Drone Net in Toyko, Japan, and G-Force delivers the Products directly.
 
(7) The Company relies on the marketing and sales of Drone Net, in part for its own success. If Drone Net realizes increased demand for the products, then in turn our own operations will increase. It should be noted that, at present, Drone Net is our primary customer.
 
Marketing
 
Our marketing plan, at present, is not yet complete and is still being researched and developed. SkyFight-X, our current primary product, is being marketed solely by our primary customer, Drone Net. We believe that Drone Net’s sales of our products will result in increased demand, from Drone Net, for future products, but this is not directly related to any marketing activities conducted by the Company itself. We do not currently engage in any marketing efforts, with the exception of the company’s website located at: https://www.world-scan-project.com/
 
In the future, as our operations progress, we may begin to evaluate the possibility of marketing our products through various methods, but no such plans have been developed with any level of specificity at this point in time.

Future plans
 
The Company plans to expand its business in the future in the following ways:
 
(1) To expand the revenues from Drone Net
 
Drone Net has plans to increase its instructional programs, shops and race tracks. The Company expects to increase revenue according to the business expansion of Drone Net. At present, the exact amount that Drone Net will increase its orders in the future is speculative, and we will need to evaluate in greater detail as the scope of Drone Net’s operations increases.
 
(2) To begin direct sales to consumers in Japan
 
The Company has tentative plans to evaluate the possibility of directly selling its products via web-based direct sales in Japan. It is possible that we may evaluate, and even begin, to do so in 2022, but we do not currently have any concrete plans to do so at this point in time.
 
(3) To start selling products overseas, mainly in the USA
 
The Company has intentions to begin developing sales agencies, and at such time to begin to sell the Products through such agencies, overseas beginning, potentially, in 2022. These plans remain speculative in nature, however, in order to begin to progress these efforts, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Pine Hill Productions, Inc., a New York corporation (Pine Hill”) on March 3, 2020. Pine Hill shall support the Company to expand its business operations into the USA. The consulting fee due to Pine Hill is $3,000 per month.
 
(4) To develop new products
 
META DIVER
 
META DIVER is an application for smartphones that provides user experience with full-scale VR images. The purpose of the application is to provide 3D data such as historical heritage as VR video content.
 
The main function of the application is image reproductions of VR images and 360 degree images, with VR images of World Heritages, historical heritages, and natural heritage both in Japan and overseas as its contents. Currently, all contents in the applications are free of charge.
 
META DIVER is still in production and is expected to launch around May 2022.
 
The Company also have tentative plans, which have not progressed beyond intentions at this point, to evaluate the possibility of working on a underwater drone and a hover bike (flying bike). We are exploring the feasibility of these endeavors, however, there is no guarantee that such plans will come to fruition.
 
Government Regulations in Japan
 
Currently, given that the entirety of our operations are conducted within Japan, and our customers reside in Japan, only the rules and regulations pertaining to drones within Japan are presently applicable to the Company’s operations.
 
The Aviation Act prohibits flying drones over residential areas or areas surrounding an airport without permission from the Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation. Flying drones during night time and during an event is also prohibited. In addition, drones no lighter than 200 grams in unrestricted areas across the country are required to stay below 150 meters (492 feet), and also be kept at least 30 meters (98 feet) from people, buildings, and vehicles.
 
Given that SkyFight-X is lighter than 200 grams, flying SkyFight-X’s for the purposes of drone racing or participating in drone flying schools is not prohibited by any pertinent regulations in Japan. We are not subject to specific regulations pertaining to the manufacturing and design of the SkyFight-X at this time.
