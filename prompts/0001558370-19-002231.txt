 Item 1. Business
     Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (Genesis) is a holding company with subsidiaries that, on a consolidated basis, comprise one of the nation's largest post-acute care providers.  As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company,” and similar terms, refer collectively to Genesis and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.  We offer inpatient services through our network of 425 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities located in 29 states.  We also supply rehabilitation and respiratory therapy to more than 1,400 locations in 46 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2018.  In addition, we provide a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators through our administrative services subsidiary and to third-party operators with whom we contract through our management services subsidiary. There were 21 facilities subject to such management services agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators as of December 31, 2018. All of our healthcare operating subsidiaries focus on providing quality care to the people we serve, and our skilled nursing facility subsidiaries, which comprise the largest portion of our consolidated business, have a strong commitment to treating patients who require a high level of skilled nursing care and extensive rehabilitation therapy, whom we refer to as high-acuity patients.  For additional information regarding our financial condition, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Overview.”       Operations
 As of December 31, 2018, we offered inpatient services through our network of 425 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities across 29 states, consisting of 399 skilled nursing facilities and 26 stand-alone assisted/senior living facilities. Of the 425 facilities, 359 are leased, 45 are owned, 15 are managed and 6 are joint ventures. Collectively, these skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities have 50,957 licensed beds, approximately 68% of which are concentrated in the states of California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. See Item 2. “Properties” for the full count of facilities by state.  Our skilled nursing and assisted/senior living facilities are generally clustered in large urban or suburban markets. We leased 84% of our facilities as of December 31, 2018.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 84% of our revenue from our skilled nursing facilities. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from our assisted/senior living services, rehabilitation therapy services provided to third-party facilities, and other ancillary services.
 Our services focus primarily on the medical and physical issues facing elderly patients and are provided by the employees of our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living communities, integrated and third-party rehabilitation therapy business, and other ancillary services.

 As of December 31, 2018, we had three reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities and is the largest portion of our business; (2) rehabilitation therapy services, which includes our integrated and third-party rehabilitation and respiratory therapy services; and (3) all other services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the inpatient services segment generated approximately 86% of our revenue, the rehabilitation therapy services segment generated approximately 11% of our revenue and all other services accounted for the remaining balance of our revenue. For additional information regarding the financial performance of our reportable operating segments, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7 – "Segment Information,"” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Inpatient Services Segment
 Skilled Nursing Facilities
 As of December 31, 2018, our skilled nursing facilities provided skilled nursing care at 399 regionally clustered facilities, having 47,536 licensed beds, in 29 states.  We have developed programs for, and actively market our services to, high-acuity patients who are typically admitted to our facilities as they recover from strokes, other neurological conditions, cardiovascular and respiratory ailments, joint replacements and other muscular or skeletal disorders.  We also provide 24-hour long-term care services for elderly residents and people with a chronic condition or a prolonged illness. Our staff is devoted to the creation of a comforting environment and focused on helping each person achieve their highest level of independence and vitality. 
 We use interdisciplinary teams of experienced medical professionals to provide services prescribed by physicians. These teams include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, certified nursing assistants and other professionals who provide individualized comprehensive nursing care to our short-stay and long-stay patients. Many of our skilled nursing facilities are equipped to provide specialty care, such as on-site dialysis, ventilator care, cardiac and pulmonary management. We also provide standard services to each of our skilled nursing patients, including room and board, special nutritional programs, social services, recreational activities and related healthcare and other services.
 Our PowerBack Rehabilitation branded facilities are designed to provide short-stay skilled nursing facilities that deliver a comprehensive rehabilitation regimen in accommodations specifically designed to serve high-acuity patients. We believe that having PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities enables us to more effectively serve higher acuity patients and achieve a higher skilled mix than a traditional hybrid skilled nursing facility, which in turn results in higher reimbursement rates. Skilled mix is the average daily number of Medicare and insurance patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the average daily number of total patients we serve at our skilled nursing facilities.  Insurance as a payor source includes both traditional commercial insurance programs as well as managed care plans, including Medicare Advantage plans.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 10 PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities with 1,075 beds. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we have 21 facilities subject to management agreements with unaffiliated or jointly owned skilled nursing facility operators. The income associated with the management services provided to the third-party facility operator is included in inpatient services in our segment reporting as services are performed primarily by personnel supporting the inpatient services segment. 
 Our administrative service company provides a full complement of administrative and consultative services to our affiliated operators to allow them to better focus on the delivery of healthcare services.
 Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
 We complement our skilled nursing care business by providing assisted/senior living services at 26 stand-alone facilities with 2,209 beds and offer an additional 1,212 assisted/senior living beds within our skilled nursing facilities as of December 31, 2018. Our assisted/senior living facilities provide residential accommodations, activities, meals, security, housekeeping and assistance in the activities of daily living to seniors who are independent or who require some support, but not the level of nursing care provided in a skilled nursing facility.  Rehabilitation Therapy Services
 As of December 31, 2018, we provided rehabilitation therapy services, including speech-language pathology (SLP), physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and respiratory therapy, to more than 1,400 healthcare locations in 46 states and the District of Columbia, including 396 facilities operated by us. We provide rehabilitation therapy services at our skilled nursing facilities and assisted/senior living facilities as part of an integrated service offering in connection with our skilled nursing care. We believe that an integrated approach to treating high-acuity patients enhances our ability to achieve successful patient outcomes and enables us to 

 
  2

 
identify and treat patients who can benefit from our rehabilitation therapy services. We believe hospitals and physician groups often refer high-acuity patients to our skilled nursing facilities because they recognize the value of an integrated approach to providing skilled nursing care and rehabilitation therapy services.  
 We believe that we have also established a strong reputation as a premium provider of rehabilitation therapy services to third-party skilled nursing operators in our local markets, with a recognized ability to provide these services to high-acuity patients. Our approach to providing rehabilitation therapy services for third-party operators emphasizes quality treatment and successful clinical outcomes. In addition to our rehabilitation therapy services in the United States, we have a presence in the Chinese and Hong Kong markets with initiatives to develop a rehabilitation therapy care delivery model and other services.  The revenues generated and long-lived assets associated with this expansion are immaterial as of December 31, 2018. 
 Other Services
 As of December 31, 2018, we provided an array of other specialty medical services, including physician services, staffing services, and other healthcare related services.
 Industry Trends
     Healthcare Reforms.  In recent years, reforms under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) and other policy changes are reshaping all aspects of healthcare payment and delivery systems in the United States.  A significant objective of these reforms is to transform delivery of and payment for healthcare services by holding providers accountable for the cost and quality of care provided.  
     Medicare and many commercial third party payors are implementing Accountable Care Organization (ACO) models in which groups of providers share in the benefit and risk of providing care to an assigned group of individuals.  Other reimbursement methodology reforms include value-based purchasing, in which a portion of provider reimbursement is redistributed based on relative performance on designated economic, clinical quality and patient satisfaction metrics.  In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing demonstration and mandatory programs to bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care.  
     These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans.  As alternative payment models seek to incentivize delivery of better care at lower costs, providers are making fundamental changes in their day-to-day operations to better coordinate and manage the care of patients, improve care transitions, reduce lengths of stay and prevent avoidable rehospitalizations.  
     In recent years, these healthcare reform trends, among other factors, have resulted in a decline in the occupancy and skilled mix of our skilled nursing facilities and have reduced the utilization of rehabilitation therapy services.
     Reimbursement Trends.  In recent years, continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain the rate of payment for the provision of healthcare services has impacted providers like us.  Federal Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates in many states are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. In recent years, those adjustments have not reflected actual increases in the cost of providing healthcare services. 
     In addition to rate pressure, in recent years we have continued to see a shift from “traditional” Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare patients to Medicare Advantage patients.  Reimbursement rates and average lengths of stay are generally lower for services provided to Medicare Advantage patients than they are for the same services provided to traditional FFS Medicare patients, negatively impacting our profitability.  In addition to the federal Medicare program, a number of states use managed care to coordinate long term care support services and many states are interested in implementing or expanding existing ones.  The emergence of managed Medicaid programs has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement for our services and has introduced new challenges and complexities with respect to billings and collections. We expect further migration towards managed Medicare and Medicaid programs.

 Accordingly, in recent years, these reimbursement-related trends, along with other factors, have resulted in lower operating margins in each of our business segments despite our significant efforts to conform both our clinical operations and overall expense structure to these emerging payment trends.
     Revenue Sources
     We derive revenue primarily from the following programs: Medicaid, Medicaid Managed Care, Medicare, Medicare Advantage Plans, commercial insurance payors and private pay patients.
      Medicaid
     Medicaid typically covers patients that require standard room and board services, and provides reimbursement rates that are generally lower than rates earned from other sources. Medicaid is a program financed by state funds and matching federal funds administered by the states and their political subdivisions. Medicaid programs generally provide health benefits for qualifying individuals, and may supplement Medicare benefits for the disabled and for persons aged 65 and older meeting financial eligibility requirements. Medicaid reimbursement formulas are established by each state with the approval of the federal government in accordance with federal guidelines. Seniors who enter skilled nursing facilities as private pay clients can become eligible for Medicaid once they have substantially depleted their assets. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for skilled nursing facilities.
     Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state and is based upon a number of different systems, including cost-based, prospective payment; case mixed adjusted payments and negotiated rate systems. Rates are subject to a state’s annual budgetary requirements and funding, statutory and regulatory changes and interpretations and rulings by individual state agencies and State Plan Amendments approved by CMS.  
     Medicaid Managed Care
     Medicaid Managed Care is a health care delivery system of Medicaid health benefits and additional services through contracted arrangements between state Medicaid agencies and managed care organizations (MCOs) designed to manage cost, utilization and quality of care.  The delivery of long term care services is provided through capitated payment programs known as Managed Long Term Services and Support (MLTSS).  These MLTSS programs use a strategy for expanding home and community based services, ensuring quality and increasing efficiency.  The number of states with MLTSS programs in 2018 is 22. Genesis has operations in 13 states that have MLTSS programs. States may implement a Medicaid MLTSS program under multiple federal authorities with the approval of CMS.       Medicare
      Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare benefits to individuals who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled. To achieve and maintain Medicare certification, a skilled nursing facility must sign a Medicare provider agreement and meet the CMS “Requirements for Participation” on an ongoing basis, as determined in periodic facility inspections or “surveys” conducted primarily by the state licensing agency in the state where the facility is located. Medicare pays for inpatient skilled nursing facility services under the prospective payment system (PPS). The prospective payment for each beneficiary is based upon the medical condition of and care needed by the beneficiary. Medicare Part A skilled nursing facility coverage is limited to 100 days per episode of illness for those beneficiaries who require daily care following discharge from an acute care hospital.

eligible patients.
------------------

      Medicare reimburses our skilled nursing facilities under PPS for a defined bundle of inpatient covered services. Medicare coverage criteria require that a beneficiary spend at least three qualifying days in an inpatient acute setting before Medicare will cover the skilled nursing service. While beneficiaries are eligible for up to 100 days per episode of illness of skilled nursing care services (defined as requiring daily skilled nursing and/or skilled rehabilitation services), current law imposes a daily co-payment after the 20th day of covered services. Under PPS, facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient, per day, for certain services based on the anticipated costs of treating patients.  The amount to be paid is determined by classifying each patient into a resource utilization group (RUG) category that is based upon each patient's acuity level. 
     For Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the Medicare Part A coverage, rehabilitation services are included in the per diem payment. For beneficiaries who do not meet the coverage criteria for Part A services, rehabilitation services may be provided under Medicare Part B. As discussed above, there are specific coverage and payment requirements.
     Part B Rehabilitation Requirements
      One of the more challenging rehabilitation requirements is that covered Part B services are limited with a payment cap by combined SLP and PT services and a separate annual cap for OT services. These caps were implemented under the authority of the Balanced Budget Amendments of 1997. On multiple occasions during the past two decades, Congress has interceded to suspend the “therapy caps” offering an “exceptions process” so claims in excess of the annualized cap can be processed.  
     The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 extended the therapy exceptions process but added a second tier cap mandating manual medical review (MMR) for claims submitted that exceeded $3,700 for PT and SLP services combined and another threshold of $3,700 for OT services.  The Medicare Access & CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which authorized payment reforms for physicians and other professional services, including the three rehabilitative therapies, included provisions not only stabilizing the professional fee schedules, but also extending the therapy cap exceptions process through December 31, 2017. 
     On February 9, 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was signed into law, which provides for the repeal of all therapy caps retroactively to January 1, 2018.  The law requires post-pay MMR in certain instances, once claims for SLP and PT reach $3,000 and OT reaches $3,000. 
     Medicare Annual Market Basket
     Current law requires CMS to calculate an annual market basket update to the payment rates. Provisions of PPACA directed the agency to reduce that payment level by a calculated multi-factor productivity adjustment. The agency also retains the authority to review and adjust payments for corrections to previous year market baskets where over/under payment exceeded 0.05% between the projected market basket and the actual performance. Annually, on a federal fiscal year basis (October 1), the agency makes its payment changes. Normally, CMS issues proposed rules during April providing 60-days for stakeholder input, and issues finalized rules 60 days prior to the start of the fiscal year. If there are no substantive changes in rules and regulations, the agency has the authority to issue rate adjustments in a notice, rather than a proposed rule. The notice must be issued 60 days before the beginning of the fiscal year.
     On July 29, 2016, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2017 outlining a net increase of 2.4% to Medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing facilities attributable to a 2.7% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.3% multi-factor productivity adjustment required by law.
     On July 31, 2017, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2018 outlining Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities.  The final rule uses a market basket percentage of 1.0% effective October 1, 2017.
     On August 8, 2018, CMS issued a final rule for fiscal year 2019 outlining Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities.  A market basket increase of 2.4% was mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 effective October 1, 2018. Reimbursement for fiscal year 2019 is based on the current payment methodology using the Resource Utilization Group, Version IV (RUG-IV) model with one significant change, the addition of the Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (see below) incentive multiplier.

 Skilled Nursing Facility - Quality Measures Reporting Program (SNF QRP):
     The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act) imposed new data reporting requirements for certain Post-Acute-Care (PAC) providers. The IMPACT Act requires that each skilled nursing facility submit their quality measures data.  Beginning with fiscal year 2018, and each subsequent year, if a skilled nursing facility does not submit required quality data, their payment rates for the year are reduced by 2.0% points for that fiscal year. Application of the 2.0% reduction may result in payment rates for a fiscal year being less than the preceding fiscal year. In addition, reporting-based reductions to the market basket increase factor will not be cumulative; they will only apply for the fiscal year involved. A skilled nursing facility will receive a notification letter from its Medicare administrator contractor if it was non-compliant with the Quality Reporting Program reporting requirements and is subject to the payment reduction.
     Current performance measures mandated for the SNF QRP for fiscal year 2019 were established in the final SNF PPS rules adopted on August 4, 2017 (FY 2018 SNF PPS Rules). The final rules summarize these requirements, finalize adoption of a new measure removal factor for previously adopted SNF QRP measures, review the quality measures currently adopted for the fiscal year 2020 SNF QRP and finalize the intention to specify new measures to be adopted no later than October 1, 2019 for the fiscal year 2020 SNF QRP.  The SNF QRP applies to freestanding skilled nursing facilities, skilled nursing facilities affiliated with acute care facilities, and all non-critical access hospital swing-bed rural hospitals. Under the SNF QRP, a skilled nursing facility’s annual market basket percentage is reduced by 2.0% points if the skilled nursing facility does not submit quality measure data in accordance with thresholds set by the IMPACT Act.  Final fiscal year 2019 SNF PPS rules (FY 2019 SNF PPS Rules) specified that skilled nursing facilities that do not meet the SNF QRP requirements for a program year will receive a notice of non-compliance.   
     Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF-VBP) Program 
     The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA) of 2014, enacted into law on April 1, 2014, authorized a SNF-VBP Program that requires CMS to adopt a SNF-VBP payment adjustment for skilled nursing facilities effective October 1, 2018.  CMS issued the fiscal year 2018 skilled nursing facility PPS Final Rule on August 4, 2017, which included instructions for the SNF-VBP Program.  The PPS Final Rule adopts the Skilled Nursing Facility Readmission Measure as the skilled nursing facility 30-day all-cause readmission measure for the SNF-VBP Program.  Effective October 1, 2018, skilled nursing facilities will have an opportunity to receive incentive payments based on their performance under the SNF-VBP Program. 
     All skilled nursing facilities receive two scores, one for achievement and the other for improvement of their hospital readmission measure over the designated reporting period. All skilled nursing facilities are ranked from high to low based on the higher of the two scores. The highest ranked facilities will receive the highest payments, and the lowest ranked facilities will receive payments that are less than what they otherwise would have received without the SNF-VBP Program. 
     CMS began to withhold 2.0% of Medicare payments starting October 1, 2018, to fund the incentive payment pool and will redistribute 60% of the withheld payments back to skilled nursing facilities through the SNF-VBP Program.  All skilled nursing facilities will receive an incentive multiplier to apply to each of their RUG rates for the fiscal year that will either provide an incentive payment, a full RUG payment, or a reduction.    
     In addition to setting the payment rules for skilled nursing facility services using the SNF-VBP Program, CMS annually adjusts its payment rules for other acute and post-acute service providers including hospitals and home health agencies using a similar SNF-VBP Program. It is important to understand the Medicare program and its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services.  Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins.
     The FY 2019 SNF PPS Rules reiterate the SNF-VBP program instructions and affirm that effective October 1, 2018, skilled nursing facilities now experience a 2.0% withholding to fund the incentive payment pool. Simultaneously, based upon performance, skilled nursing facilities have an opportunity to have their reimbursement rates adjusted for incentive payments based on their performance under the SNF-VBP Program.  Of the 2.0% withheld under the SNF-VBP Program, we expect to retain 1.3% based on performance.

     The FY 2019 SNF PPS Rules also account for social risk factors in the SNF-VBP Program and finalize the numerical values for the skilled nursing facility 30-day all-cause readmission measure for the fiscal year 2021 SNF-VBP Program based on the fiscal year 2017 baseline period.  In addition, the FY 2019 SNF PPS Rules finalize scoring policy for skilled nursing facilities without sufficient baseline period data, finalize SNF-VBP Program scoring adjustment for low-volume skilled nursing facilities and establish an extraordinary circumstances exception policy for the SNF-VBP Program.
     Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM)
     The FY 2019 SNF PPS Rules include a new case-mix classification system called the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM) that will replace the existing case-mix classification system, RUG-IV, effective October 1, 2019.  PDPM is designed to increase focus on patients’ conditions and clinical needs, as opposed to the volume of services provided, thereby improving payment accuracy and encouraging a more patient-driven care model.  Under PDPM, there are only two required minimum data set (MDS) assessments, the admission assessment and discharge assessment, with one optional MDS assessment, the interim payment assessment.
     PDPM utilizes a combination of six components to determine the amount of the per diem payment.  Five of the components are case-mix adjusted, meaning they are intended to cover the utilization of skilled nursing facility resources that vary according to patient characteristics. These components are as follows:  PT, OT, SLP, non-therapy ancillary (NTA) services, and nursing. The sixth component is non-case-mix adjusted, meaning it is intended to cover those skilled nursing facility resources that do not vary by patient.  The PT, OT, and NTA components are also subject to a variable adjustment factor that serves to adjust the per diem payment over the course of the patient’s stay. PT and OT services have variable per diem adjustments beginning on the 21st day of the Medicare stay and further adjusted every seven days thereafter.  NTA services have variable per diem adjustments beginning on the 4th day of the Medicare stay.  PDPM utilizes patient specific, data-driven characteristics to classify patients into payment groups within each of the six components, which are used as the basis for the payment amount. 
     PDPM also revises the limits on group and concurrent therapy.  RUG-IV included a 25% limit per discipline (PT, OT, SLP), for group therapy and did not impose a limit for concurrent therapy.  PDPM includes a 25% limit per discipline (PT, OT, SLP), for both combined group and concurrent therapy.
     Decisions Regarding Skilled Nursing Facility Payment
     In addition to setting the payment rules for skilled nursing facility services using the SNF-VBP Program, CMS annually adjusts its payment rules for other acute and post-acute service providers including hospitals and home health agencies using a similar SNF-VBP Program. It is important to understand the Medicare program and that its reimbursement rates and rules are subject to frequent change. These include statutory and regulatory changes, rate adjustments (including retroactive adjustments), administrative or executive orders and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially adversely affect the rates at which Medicare reimburses us for our services.  Budget pressures often lead the federal government to reduce or place limits on reimbursement rates under Medicare. Implementation of these and other types of measures has in the past, and could in the future, result in substantial reductions in our revenue and operating margins.     Sequestration of Medicare Rates 
     The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires a mandatory, across the board reduction in federal spending, called a sequestration.  Medicare FFS claims with dates of service or dates of discharge on or after April 1, 2013 incur a 2.0% reduction in Medicare payments.  All Medicare rate payments and settlements have incurred this mandatory reduction and it will continue to remain in place through at least 2023, unless Congress takes further action.     Medicare Advantage Plans 
     Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called Medicare Part C or MA Plans, are offered by private companies that are approved by CMS.  Medicare Advantage Plans cover all Medicare services and manage care of patients through a network of doctors, hospitals and other providers. Reimbursement rates for nursing care are negotiated with the plans and are not set by skilled nursing facility PPS rules of payments. CMS has indicated that Medicare Advantage Plans can determine whether any aspects of PDPM, which is effective October 1, 2019, will be incorporated into their reimbursement methodology.

     Commercial Insurance
      A different type of insurance, commercial long-term care insurance, is also available to consumers. However, its role as a significant contributor to industry revenues has not been fully realized. Factors contributing to the lack of revenues include high premium costs and intermittent, often significant premium rate increases throughout the life of the policy and denials of coverage.     Private and Other Payors
     Private and other payors consist primarily of self-pay individuals, family members or other third parties who directly pay for the services we provide.
     Reimbursement for our Services
     Reimbursement for Skilled Nursing Facilities
     The majority of skilled nursing facility revenues in the U.S. come from Medicare and Medicaid, with the remainder of revenues derived from managed care and commercial insurance, other third-party sources and private pay.  Typically, all patients that enter a skilled nursing facility begin as a short-term acute care patient and either get discharged or become long-term care residents.  After a patient no longer qualifies for skilled care under Medicare, the reimbursement of costs incurred by a skilled nursing facility patient will be shifted to private pay (out of pocket) resources and then Medicaid if the patient qualifies.    Historically, adjustments to reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid have had a significant effect on our revenue and results of operations.  Recently enacted, pending and proposed legislation and administrative rulemaking at the federal and state levels could have similar effects on our business.  Efforts to impose reduced reimbursement rates, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, any delay or default by the federal or state governments in making Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement payments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Reimbursement for Assisted/Senior Living Facilities
     Assisted/senior living facilities generate revenues primarily from private pay sources, including third-party insurance and self-pay, with only a small portion derived from government sources.
     Reimbursement for Rehabilitation Services
     Outside of therapy received during a Medicare Part A covered stay of up to 100 days, most of our rehabilitation therapy services are typically reimbursed under the Medicare Part B program. The payments made to our rehabilitation therapy services segment for services it provides to skilled nursing facilities are determined by negotiated patient per diem rates or a negotiated fee schedule based on the type of service rendered. In addition, this segment is also directly reimbursed from the Medicare Part B program and other insurance companies through its certified outpatient rehabilitation agencies and group practices for services provided in assisted living facilities, homes and the community.  Recent Legislative, Regulatory and other Governmental Actions Affecting Revenue
     The revenue and operating environment for the post-acute and long term care services we deliver has been significantly shaped by a series of healthcare laws passed by Congress and implemented by government entities. 
     The broad healthcare reforms enacted as part of PPACA have been among the most significant of revisions. Embedded in this complex legislation were provisions redesigning the private insurance market place, expanding the obligations of Medicaid,

empowering changes in Medicare and stimulating innovations in payment and care delivery. The implementation of the provisions of PPACA has shaped the policy landscape. 
     Our operating environment has been further influenced by specific provisions in other legislation.

As signed into law, this legislation has provisions restricting the Medicare skilled nursing facilities PPS market basket index for fiscal year 2019 to 2.4%, limits the physician/non-physician fee schedules update for the coming year, and alters payment beginning in 2022 for services provided by therapy assistants.

      Skilled Nursing Facilities
     Healthcare Reform Initiatives
     We believe we are transforming our business and operations for success in a post-healthcare reform environment.  As healthcare reform continues to be implemented, we believe post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals and payors and operate with scale will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  We believe our business strategies should position us to become a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay and hospital readmissions, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models.
     As the industry and its regulators engage in this new environment, we are positioning ourselves to adapt to changes that are ultimately made to the delivery system. 
    
· | Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP): Effective January 1, 2016, we entered our physician services subsidiary into MSSP as an ACO. Successful participation requires us to carefully document delivery, meet specific performance criteria and meet specific savings targets. While savings were generated for the 2016 performance year, they were not enough to meet the minimum savings target, and therefore, we did not share in any of the savings. In 2017, savings were not generated. The program continued into 2018 and 2019 and is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. The program is designed so that when savings targets are met participating providers will receive a share of the savings.

· | CMS Bundling Demonstrations: We had been successful in managing multiple sites participating in the CMS Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) demonstration. Based on the BPCI quarterly reconciliations, accumulated historical data and current data, our performance was within expectations. The demonstration term for the current bundling models expired on September 30, 2018. In late January 2018, CMS revised its program design by proposing a new model called BPCI Advanced. This new BPCI Advanced model, which commenced on October 1, 2018, precludes post-acute providers from participating in a

manner similar to the original demonstration program. Accordingly, we are evaluating whether this new program offers opportunities for participation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths support our business strategy:
 Quality Patient Care, Differentiated Clinical Capabilities and Clinical Specialization: To ensure clinical oversight and continuity of patient care, we employ physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners that are primarily involved in providing medical direction and/or direct patient care. This medical staff structure allows for significant involvement of physicians at all levels of the organization, thus ensuring an emphasis on quality care is maintained.  In an effort to further enhance the quality of care we provide to our patients, we have made significant investments to expand rehabilitation gym capacity and develop clinical specialty units. The development of clinical specialty units in our facility portfolio has allowed us to better meet the needs of our patients.  These specialty units, along with our advanced capabilities in post-acute cardiac and pulmonary management, differentiate us in local areas, as competitors often do not offer these programs.  Our focus on quality patient care, differentiated clinical capabilities and clinical specialization allows us to care for higher acuity patients who are typically reimbursed by Medicare or managed care payors.
 Strong Geographic Density in Regional Markets:  We have developed geographic density in markets with 68% of our total licensed skilled nursing beds located in nine states: California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Within these and other states, we seek to cluster our facilities to create a dense, localized footprint.   By clustering our facilities, we are able to provide a larger and more diverse number of clinical services within a regional market.  As a result, we are often the leading skilled nursing facility operator in many of the regional markets in which we operate, based on number of beds.  Strategically clustered facilities in single or contiguous markets also allow us to achieve lower operating costs through greater purchasing power and operating efficiencies, facilitate the development of strong relations with state and local regulators and provide us with the ability to coordinate sales and marketing strategies.  Our strong reputation and operating performance in regional markets also allows us to develop relationships with key referral sources, including hospitals and other managed care payors.
 Experienced Management Team with Proven Operating Performance: We have an experienced management team with deep post-acute experience. Our management team has demonstrated an ability to adapt to a rapidly changing business climate, providing a distinct competitive advantage in navigating the complex and evolving post-acute care industry.    
 Key Partnerships and Relationships: We have partnered with hospitals in our local markets to enhance the coordination of patient care during and after a post-acute rehabilitation stay. The goal of these relationships is to provide quality care while lowering hospital readmission rates and reducing overall healthcare costs.  Further, these relationships allow us to manage patient outcomes and coordinate care once a patient leaves the acute care setting and enters one of our facilities.  We have also forged key relationships with managed care payors to better align quality goals and reimbursement, resulting in a more coordinated care approach that reduces hospital readmissions.  As an increasing number of patients gain access to health insurance through healthcare reform or move to managed Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are poised to capture additional market share as managed care companies look to match quality patient care with a cost efficient setting. 
 Leading Post-Acute Provider Well Positioned for Increased Demand for Post-Acute Care: As life expectancy continues to increase in the United States and seniors account for a higher percentage of the U.S. population, we believe overall demand for the services we provide will increase.  As the largest operator of skilled nursing facilities and the largest provider of post-acute rehabilitation therapy services in the U.S., we are well positioned to benefit from these trends by delivering cost effective, high quality services. 
 Strategy
 We believe that we are well positioned to succeed in what will be an increasingly integrated healthcare delivery system.  Our core strategy is to provide superior clinical outcomes with an approach that is patient-centered and focused on lowering costs by reducing lengths of stay and improving outcomes by developing programs to prevent avoidable rehospitalizations.

 
  10

 

 The key elements of our business strategy include:
 Commitment to quality care.  We are focused on qualitative and quantitative clinical performance measures in order to enhance and improve the care provided in our facilities.  We continually seek to enhance our reputation for providing clinical capabilities and favorable outcomes.  Among other things, we have and will continue to increase our professional nursing mix and integrate nurse practitioners and employed physicians into our clinical model.  We have incentivized our management team to improve clinical performance to further ensure accountability for the quality of care. 
 Position ourselves for success in a value based environment. As healthcare reform continues to be implemented, we believe post-acute healthcare providers who provide quality diversified care, have density and strong reputations in local markets, have good relationships with acute care hospitals and operate with scale will have a competitive advantage in an episodic payment environment.  Our ongoing clinical and operational initiatives position us as a valuable partner to acute care hospitals and managed care organizations that are seeking to increase care coordination, reduce lengths of stay, more effectively manage healthcare costs and develop new care delivery and payment models.
 Improve operating efficiency.  We are continually focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling costs, while maintaining quality patient care.  Investments in information systems, the development of tools to more effectively manage operating costs and the reengineering of key business and operating processes are an effective way to grow cash flow and improve operating margins.  Such investments involve significant upfront costs that must be assessed on a long-term cost-benefit basis and can be limited due to our available liquidity.
 Focusing on core markets by optimizing our facility portfolio.  We are continually evaluating the long-term strategic value of our portfolio of facilities and other operating businesses.  In this regard, we will continue to pursue the sale, divestiture, closure or reconfiguration of facilities or businesses that are unprofitable, located in unattractive or saturated markets, physically obsolete or not core to our business strategy.  Shedding non-core or non-strategic assets increases our focus and resources to assets in markets where we have geographic density, strong hospital partnerships and the greatest growth potential.
 Grow through selective acquisitions and successful integration. The post-acute care industry is highly fragmented.  The vast majority of skilled nursing facilities are owned by local and regional groups, providing an opportunity for consolidation.  We seek strategic acquisitions in selected target markets with strong demographic trends for growth in our service population.  Expansion of existing facility clusters and the creation of new clusters in local markets will allow us to leverage existing operations and to achieve greater operating efficiencies.  
 Government Regulation
 General
 Healthcare is an area of extensive and frequent regulatory change. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant impact on our methods and costs of doing business.  Our subsidiaries that provide healthcare services are subject to federal, state and local laws relating to, among other things, licensure, delivery, quality and adequacy of care, physical plant requirements, life safety, personnel and operating policies.  In addition, our provider subsidiaries are subject to federal and state laws that govern billing and reimbursement, relationships with vendors and business relationships with physicians.  Such laws include the Anti-Kickback Statue, the federal False Claims Act (FCA), the Stark Law and state corporate practice of medicine statutes.
 Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities, assisted/senior living facilities and outpatient rehabilitation agencies to verify that we continue to comply with the applicable regulations and standards. We must pass these inspections to remain licensed under state laws, to comply with our Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements, and, in some instances, to continue our participation in the Veterans Administration program. We can only participate in these third-party payment programs if inspections by regulatory authorities reveal that our facilities and agencies are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements. In the ordinary course of business, we may receive notices from federal or state regulatory authorities alleging deficiencies in certain regulatory practices. These statements of deficiency may require us to take corrective action to regain and maintain compliance.  In some cases, federal or state regulators may impose other remedies including imposition of CMPs, temporary payment bans, loss of certification as a provider in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program or revocation of a state operating license. 

 
  11

 

 We believe that the regulatory environment surrounding the healthcare industry subjects providers to intense scrutiny. In the ordinary course of business, providers are subject to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies related to compliance with participation and payment rules under government payment programs. These inquiries may originate from the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audits, state Medicaid agencies, local and state ombudsman offices and CMS Recovery Audit Contractors, among other agencies.  In response to the inquiries, investigations and audits, the federal and state governments continue to impose citations for regulatory deficiencies and other regulatory penalties, including demands for refund of overpayments, expanded CMPs that extend over long periods of time and date back to incidents long before surveyor visits, Medicare and Medicaid payment bans and terminations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We vigorously contest these matters where appropriate; however, there are significant legal and other expenses involved that consume our financial and personnel resources. Expansion of enforcement activity could adversely affect our business, financial condition or the results of our operations. 
 Five-Star Quality Rating
     In 2008, CMS created the Five-Star Quality Rating System (the Star Ratings) to help consumers, families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities and choose providers more easily.  Skilled nursing facilities receive an overall star rating from one to five stars based on three components: health inspection rating (survey results), quality measure calculations and staffing data. Each of the components receives star rankings as well. Skilled nursing facilities with five stars are considered to have much above average quality and skilled nursing facilities with one star are considered to have quality much below average. Families are increasingly consulting the Star Ratings prior to placing a family member in a skilled nursing facility and hospital referral partners are increasingly narrowing their panels of skilled nursing facilities to include only those with at least a three-star overall rating. However, CMS has acknowledged that there are limitations in using the Star Ratings to make inferences about nursing center quality, including (i) variations by state in survey processes, (ii) the use of payroll based data that may not fully reflect actual staffing patterns and (iii) quality measures do not represent all aspects of care that could be important to consumers.  The foundation of the Star Rating is the annual survey.
     In April 2016, CMS added six quality measures to the Nursing Home Compare website. These quality measures include:  successful discharges to the community; visits to the emergency department; rehospitalizations; improvements in function; long-stay residents whose ability to move independently worsened; and antianxiety or hypnotic medications.  Five quality measures were used to compute Star Ratings in July 2016 (antianxiety or hypnotic medications were excluded).  Starting in January 2017, the five quality measures have the same weight as the other quality measures.  This change was the largest addition of quality measures to Nursing Home Compare since 2003 and nearly doubles the number of short-stay measures about key short-stay outcomes. Short-stay measures reflect care provided to residents who are in the nursing home for 100 days or less, while long-stay measures reflect care for residents who are in the nursing home for more than 100 days.  The health inspection star rating for surveys was frozen and did not reflect surveys conducted between November 28, 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. This freeze was in anticipation of the phase 2 implementation of the Requirements for Participation on the same date, as well as the implementation of the new Long-Term Care Survey Process. CMS has notified providers that the freeze to the health inspection star for surveys will be lifted within the first quarter of 2019 and all surveys conducted during the freeze will be incorporated into the health inspection star.
 The table below summarizes the Star Rating given to our qualified skilled nursing facilities:
    
 | Year ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | 2017 | 
Number of skilled nursing facilities | | 393 | | 438 | 
Number of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 251 | | 231 | 
Percentage of 3, 4 and 5-Star skilled nursing facilities | | 64 | % | 53 | %

      Payroll-Based Journal
 One of the CMS initiatives authorized by the PPACA was to improve the accuracy of nursing home staffing data. CMS initiated and rolled-out an electronic payroll-based journal (PBJ) requirement effective July 1, 2016. This system allows staffing and census information to be collected on a regular and more frequent basis than previously collected. It is also auditable to ensure accuracy.  All long-term care facilities have access to this system at no cost to facilities. Effective January 2018, the Staffing Star component of 5 star is calculated using the data collected from PBJ coupled with MDS data.

 Requirements for Participation
     On October 4, 2016, CMS published a final rule to make major changes to improve the care and safety of residents in long-term care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The policies in this final rule are targeted at reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions and infections, improving the quality of care, and strengthening safety measures for residents in these facilities.
     Changes finalized in this rule include:

· | Strengthening the rights of long-term care facility residents.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that long-term care facility staff members are properly trained on caring for residents with dementia and in preventing elder abuse.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that long-term care facilities take into consideration the health of residents when making decisions on the kinds and levels of staffing a facility needs to properly take care of its residents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensuring that staff members have the right skill sets and competencies to provide person-centered care to residents. The care plans developed for residents will take into consideration their goals of care and preferences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improving care planning, including discharge planning for all residents with involvement of the facility’s interdisciplinary team and consideration of the caregiver’s capacity, giving residents information they need for follow-up after discharge, and ensuring that instructions are transmitted to any receiving facilities or services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Updating the long-term care facility’s infection prevention and control program, including requiring an infection prevention and control officer and an antibiotic stewardship program that includes antibiotic use protocols and a system to monitor antibiotic use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The regulations became effective on November 28, 2016. CMS is implementing the regulations using a phased approach. The phases are as follows: 
    
· | Phase 1: The regulations included in Phase 1 were implemented by November 28, 2016.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The regulations included in Phase 2 were implemented by November 28, 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: The regulations included in Phase 3 must be implemented by November 28, 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Some regulatory sections are divided among more than one phase, and some of the more extensive new requirements have been placed in later phases to allow facilities time to successfully prepare to achieve compliance.
     The total costs associated with implementing the new regulations is not known at this time.  Failure to comply with the new regulations could result in exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We have substantially complied with the regulations imposed through the Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementations. We are currently preparing for Phase 3 and anticipate substantial compliance on or before November 28th, 2019.
 Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws and Enforcement
 Federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws regulate both the provision of services to government program beneficiaries and the methods and requirements for submitting claims for services rendered to such beneficiaries. Under these laws, individuals and organizations can be penalized for submitting claims for services that are not provided; that have been inadequately provided; billed in an incorrect manner, intentionally or accidentally, or other than as actually provided; not medically necessary; provided by an improper person; accompanied by an illegal inducement to utilize or refrain from utilizing a service or product; or billed or coded in a manner that does not otherwise comply with applicable governmental requirements. Penalties also may be imposed for violation of anti-kickback and patient referral laws.
 Federal and state governments have a range of criminal, civil and administrative sanctions available to penalize and remediate healthcare fraud and abuse, including exclusion of the provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, imposition of civil and criminal fines, suspension of payments and, in the case of individuals, imprisonment.
 We have internal policies and procedures, including a program designed to facilitate compliance with and to reduce exposure for violations of these and other laws and regulations. However, because enforcement efforts presently are widespread within the industry and may vary from region to region, there can be no assurance that our internal policies and procedures will significantly reduce or eliminate exposure to civil or criminal sanctions or adverse administrative determinations.

 
  13

 

 Anti-Kickback Statute
 Federal law commonly referred to as the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of anything of value, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony, and sanctions for each violation include imprisonment of up to five years, significant criminal fines, significant CMPs plus three times the amount claimed or three times the remuneration offered, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Additionally, violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA.  Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to induce referrals applicable to all payors.
 We are required under the Medicare Requirements for Participation and some state licensing laws to contract with numerous healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and hospice agencies and to arrange for these individuals or entities to provide services to our residents and patients. In addition, we have contracts with other suppliers, including pharmacies, laboratories, x-ray companies, ambulance services and medical equipment companies. Some of these individuals or entities may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to us, and we may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to these individuals or entities. Certain safe harbor provisions have been created so that although a relationship could potentially implicate the federal anti-kickback statute, it would not be treated as an offense under the statute. We attempt to structure these arrangements in a manner that falls within one of the safe harbors. Some of these arrangements may not ultimately satisfy the applicable safe harbor requirements, but failure to meet the safe harbor does not necessarily mean an arrangement is illegal.
 We believe that our arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, if any of our arrangements with third parties were to be challenged and found to be in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, we could be required to repay any amounts we received, subject to criminal penalties, and we could be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Stark Law
 Federal law commonly known as the Stark Law prohibits a physician from making referrals for particular healthcare services to entities with which the physician (or an immediate family member of the physician) has a financial relationship if the services are payable by Medicare or Medicaid. If an arrangement is covered by the Stark Law, the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met for the physician to be able to make referrals to the entity for designated health services and for the entity to be able to bill for these services. Although the term “designated health services” does not include long-term care services, some of the services provided at our skilled nursing facilities and other related business units are classified as designated health services, including PT, SLP and OT services. The term “financial relationship” is defined very broadly to include most types of ownership or compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from seeking payment from the patient or the Medicare and Medicaid programs for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral.
 The Stark Law contains exceptions for certain physician ownership or investment interests in, and certain physician compensation arrangements with, certain entities. If a compensation arrangement or investment relationship between a physician, or immediate family member, and an entity satisfies the applicable requirements for a Stark Law exception, the Stark Law will not prohibit the physician from referring patients to the entity for designated health services. The exceptions for compensation arrangements cover employment relationships, personal services contracts and space and equipment leases, among others.
 If an entity violates the Stark Law, it could be subject to significant civil penalties. The entity also may be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. If the Stark Law were found to apply to our relationships with referring physicians and no exception under the Stark Law were available, we would be required to restructure these relationships or refuse to accept referrals for designated health services from these physicians. If we were found to have submitted claims to Medicare or Medicaid for services provided pursuant to a referral prohibited by the Stark Law, we would be required to repay any amounts we received from Medicare or Medicaid for those services and could be subject to CMPs. Further, we could be excluded from participating in Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we were required to repay any amounts to Medicare or Medicaid, subjected to fines, or excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed significantly.
 As directed by PPACA, in 2010 CMS released a self-referral disclosure protocol (SRDP) for potential or actual violations of the Stark Law. Under SRDP, CMS states that it may, but is not required to, reduce the amounts due and owing for a Stark Law violation, and will consider the following factors in deciding whether to grant a reduction: (1) the nature and extent of the improper or illegal 

 
  14

 
practice; (2) the timeliness of the self-disclosure; (3) the cooperation in providing additional information related to the disclosure; (4) the litigation risk associated with the matter disclosed; and (5) the financial position of the disclosing party.
 Many states have physician relationship and referral statutes that are similar to the Stark Law. These laws generally apply regardless of the payor. We believe that our operations are structured to comply with the Stark Law and applicable state laws with respect to physician relationships and referrals. However, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties. This, in turn, could significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 False Claims Act
 Federal and state laws prohibit the submission of false claims and other acts that are considered fraudulent, wasteful or abusive. Under the federal FCA, actions against a provider can be initiated by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government. These private parties, who are often referred to as “qui tam relators” or “relators,” are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years. The use of private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically, in part because the relators are entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment.
 An FCA violation occurs when a provider knowingly submits a claim for items or services not provided.  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by creating liability for knowingly retaining an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. The submission of false claims or the failure to timely repay overpayments may lead to the imposition of significant CMPs, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Allegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services.  Worthless services cases allege that although care was provided it was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all.    
 In recent years, prosecutors and relators are increasingly bringing FCA claims based on the implied certification theory as an expansion of the scope of the FCA.  Under the implied certification theory, a violation of the FCA occurs when a provider’s request for payment implies a certification of compliance with the applicable statutes, regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment.  This development has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from the federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA. Many states have enacted similar laws providing for imposition of civil and criminal penalties for the filing of fraudulent claims.
 Because we submit thousands of claims to Medicare each year, and there is a relatively long statute of limitations under the FCA, there is a risk that intentional, or even negligent or recklessly submitted claims that prove to be incorrect, or even billing errors, cost reporting errors or lapses in statutory or regulatory compliance with regard to the provision of healthcare services (including, without limitation the Anti-Kickback Statue and the federal self-referral law discussed above), could result in significant civil or criminal penalties against us.  For information regarding matters in which the government is pursuing, or has expressed an intent to pursue, legal remedies against us under the FCA and similar state laws, see Note 22 – "Commitment and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings." 
 We believe that our operations comply with the FCA and similar state laws. However, if our claims practices were challenged and found to violate the applicable laws, any finding that we are not in compliance with these laws could require us to change our operations or could subject us to penalties or make us ineligible to participate in certain government funded healthcare programs, which could in turn significantly harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Patient Privacy and Security Laws
 There are numerous legislative and regulatory requirements at the federal and state levels addressing patient privacy and security of health information.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) contains provisions that require us to adopt and maintain business procedures designed to protect the privacy, security and integrity of patients' individual health information.  States also have laws that apply to the privacy of healthcare information. We must comply with these state privacy laws to the extent that they are more protective of healthcare information or provide additional protections not afforded by HIPAA.
 HIPAA's security standards were designed to protect specified information against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information and to protect the information against unauthorized use or disclosure.  These standards have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry because they impose extensive requirements and restrictions on the use and disclosure of identifiable patient information.  In addition, HIPAA established uniform standards governing 

 
  15

 
the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information.
 The Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH Act) expanded the requirements and noncompliance penalties under HIPAA and require correspondingly intensive compliance efforts by companies such as ours, including self-disclosures of breaches of unsecured health information to affected patients, federal officials, and, in some cases, the media.  These laws make unauthorized employee access illegal and subject to self-disclosure and penalties.  Other states may adopt similar or more extensive breach notice and privacy requirements. Compliance with these regulations could require us to make significant investments of money and other resources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable state and federal regulations relating to privacy and security of patient information.  However, if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations, we could be subject to significant penalties and other adverse consequences.
 Certificates of Need (CON) and Other Regulatory Matters
 There are CON programs in 35 states and the District of Columbia, many of which are states in which we operate skilled nursing facilities.  We are required in these jurisdictions to obtain CON approval or exemption prior to certain changes including without limitation, change in ownership, capital expenditures over certain limits, development of a new facility or expansion of services of an existing facility or service in order to control overdevelopment of healthcare projects. Certain states that do not have CON programs may have other laws or regulations that limit or restrict the development or expansion of healthcare projects. In the event we choose to develop or expand the operations of our subsidiaries, the development or expansion could be affected adversely by the inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to such approvals or possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining such approvals.  Failure to comply with state requirements with CON or other regulations that address development or expansion of services could adversely affect the progress or completion of a healthcare project. State Operating License Requirements
 We are required to obtain state licenses, certificates or permits to operate each of our skilled nursing facilities. Many states require similar licenses or certificates for assisted/senior living facilities, and some states require a license to operate outpatient agencies. Medicare requires compliance with applicable state laws as a requirement of participation.  In addition, healthcare professionals and practitioners are required to be licensed in most states. We take measures to ensure that our healthcare professionals are properly licensed and participate in required continuing education programs. We believe that our operating companies and personnel that provide these services have required licenses or certifications necessary for our current operations. Failure to obtain, maintain or renew a required license, permit or certification could adversely affect our ability to bill for services or operate in the ordinary course of business.      Federal Health Care Reform
 In addition to the matters described above affecting Medicare and Medicaid participating providers, PPACA enacted several reforms with respect to skilled nursing facilities, including payment measures to realize significant savings of federal and state funds by deterring and prosecuting fraud and abuse in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While many of the provisions of PPACA will not take effect for several years or are subject to further refinement through the promulgation of regulations, some key provisions of PPACA are presently effective.
· | Expanded CMPs and Escrow Provisions. PPACA includes expanded CMP and related provisions applicable to all Medicare and Medicaid providers. CMS rules adopted to implement applicable provisions of PPACA also provide that assessed CMPs may be collected and placed in whole or in part into an escrow account pending final disposition of the applicable administrative and judicial appeals processes. To the extent our businesses are assessed large CMPs that are collected and placed into an escrow account pending lengthy appeals, such actions could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Nursing Home Transparency Requirements. In addition to expanded CMP provisions, PPACA imposes new transparency requirements for Medicare-participating nursing facilities. In addition to previously required disclosures regarding a facility's owners, management and secured creditors, PPACA expanded the required disclosures to include information regarding the facility's organizational structure, additional information on officers, directors, trustees and "managing employees" of the facility (including their names, titles, and start dates of services), and information regarding certain parties affiliated with the facility. The transparency provisions could result in the potential for greater government scrutiny and oversight of the
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  16

 

ownership and investment structure for skilled nursing facilities, as well as more extensive disclosure of entities and individuals that comprise part of skilled nursing facilities' ownership and management structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Suspension of Payments During Pending Fraud Investigations. PPACA provides the federal government with expanded authority to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments if a provider is investigated for allegations or issues of fraud. This suspension authority creates a new mechanism for the federal government to suspend both Medicare and Medicaid payments for allegations of fraud, independent of whether a state exercises its authority to suspend Medicaid payments pending a fraud investigation. To the extent the suspension of payments provision is applied to one of our businesses for allegations of fraud, such a suspension could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.

· | Overpayment Reporting and Repayment; Expanded False Claims Act Liability. PPACA enacted several important changes that expand potential liability under the federal FCA. Overpayments related to services provided to both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries must be reported and returned to the applicable payor within specified deadlines, or else they are considered obligations of the provider for purposes of the federal FCA. This new provision substantially tightens the repayment and reporting requirements generally associated with operations of healthcare providers to avoid FCA exposure.

· | Home- and Community-Based Services. PPACA provides that states can provide home- and community-based attendant services and supports through the Community First Choice State plan option. States choosing to provide home- and community-based services under this option must make such services available to assist with activities of daily living and health related tasks under a plan of care agreed upon by the individual and his/her representative. PPACA also includes additional measures related to the expansion of home- and community-based services and authorizes states to expand coverage of home- and community-based services to individuals who would not otherwise be eligible for them. The expansion of home- and community-based services could reduce the demand for the facility-based services that we provide.

· | Health Care-Acquired Conditions. PPACA provides that the Secretary of HHS must prohibit payments to states for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for certain medical conditions acquired during the patient's receipt of healthcare services. The CMS regulation implementing this provision of PPACA prohibits states from making payments to providers under the Medicaid program for conditions that are deemed to be reasonably preventable. It uses Medicare's list of preventable conditions in inpatient hospital settings as the base (adjusted for the differences in the Medicare and Medicaid populations) and provides states the flexibility to identify additional preventable conditions and settings for which Medicaid payment will be denied.

  The provisions of PPACA discussed above are examples of recently enacted federal health reform provisions that we believe may have a material impact on the long-term care industry generally and on our business. However, the foregoing discussion is not intended to constitute, nor does it constitute, an exhaustive review and discussion of PPACA. It is possible that other provisions of PPACA may be interpreted, clarified, or applied to our businesses in a way that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similar federal and/or state legislation that may be adopted in the future could have similar effects.
 Competition
 Our skilled nursing facilities compete primarily on a local and regional basis with other skilled nursing facilities and with assisted/senior living facilities, from national and regional chains to smaller providers owning as few as a single facility. Competitors include other for-profit providers as well as non-profits, religiously-affiliated facilities, and government-owned facilities. We also compete under certain circumstances with inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) and long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals. Increasingly, we are competing with home health and community based providers who have developed programs designed to provide services to seniors outside an institutional setting, extending the time period before they need the higher level of care provided in a skilled nursing facility.  In addition, some competitors are implementing vertical alignment strategies, such as hospitals who provide long-term care services. Our ability to compete successfully varies from location to location and depends on a number of factors, including the number of competing facilities in the local market and the types of services available at those facilities, our local reputation for quality care of patients, the commitment and expertise of our caregivers, our local service offerings and treatment programs, the cost of care in each locality, and the physical appearance, location, age and condition of our facilities.
 We seek to compete effectively in each market by establishing a reputation within the local community for quality of care, attractive and comfortable facilities, and providing specialized healthcare with an emphasized focus on high-acuity patients. Programs targeting high-acuity patients, including our PowerBack Rehabilitation facilities, generally have a higher staffing level per patient than our other inpatient facilities and compete more directly with an IRF or LTAC hospitals, in addition to other skilled nursing facilities. We believe that the average cost to a third-party payor for the treatment of our typical high-acuity patient is lower if that patient is treated in one of our skilled nursing facilities than if that same patient were to be treated in an IRF or LTAC hospital.

 Our other services, such as assisted/senior living facilities and rehabilitation therapy provided to third-party facilities, also compete with local, regional, and national companies. The primary competitive factors in these businesses are similar to those for our skilled nursing facilities and include reputation, cost to provide the services, quality of clinical services, responsiveness to patient/resident needs, location and the ability to provide support in other areas such as information management and patient recordkeeping.
 Increased competition could limit our ability to attract and retain patients, attract and retain employees or to expand our business. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, may have greater brand recognition and may be more established in their respective communities than we are. Competing companies may also offer newer facilities or different programs or services than we do and may as a result be more attractive to our current patients, to potential patients and to referral sources. 
     Employees and Labor Relations
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed an aggregate of approximately 61,300 active employees as follows:  40,700 in our inpatient services segment, 14,000 (primarily therapists) in our rehabilitation therapy segment, and 6,600 in our all other services segment, which includes our administrative services subsidiary.  
 Our most significant operating cost is labor, which accounted for approximately 66% of our operating expenses from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.  We seek to manage our labor costs by improving staffing retention, maintaining competitive labor rates, and reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary staffing services.  Managing labor costs is proving to be difficult as reimbursement rate increases are often significantly lower than annual inflationary wage increases. The issue is compounded by the shift in payor mix to lower reimbursed Medicaid as well as increasing state-mandated minimum staffing requirements.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 103 collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 6,100 active employees at our skilled nursing facilities. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
     Insurance and Related Risks
 We maintain a variety of types of insurance, including general and professional liability, workers' compensation, fiduciary liability, property, cyber/privacy liability, directors' and officers' liability, crime, boiler and machinery, automobile liability, employment practices liability and earthquake and flood. We believe that our insurance programs are adequate and where there has been a direct transfer of risk to the insurance carrier, our risk is limited to the cost of the premium. We self-insure a significant portion of our potential liabilities for several risks, including certain types of general and professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile liability and health benefits. To the extent our insurance coverage is insufficient or unavailable to cover losses that would otherwise be insurable, or to the extent that our estimates of anticipated liabilities that we self-insure are significantly lower than the actual self-insured liabilities that we incur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  For additional information regarding our insurance programs, see Note 22 – “Commitments and Contingencies – Loss Reserves for Certain Self-Insured Programs,” in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 We have developed a risk management program intended to control our insurance and professional liability costs.  As part of this program, we have implemented an arbitration agreement program at each of our nursing facilities under which, upon admission and to the extent permitted under existing regulations, patients are requested (but not required) to execute an agreement that requires disputes to be arbitrated instead of litigated in court. We believe that this program accelerates resolution of disputes and reduces our liability exposure and related costs. We have also established an incident reporting process that involves the provision of tracking and trending data to our facility administrators for purposes of quality assurance and improvement. We apply an enterprise risk management program to continually evaluate risks and opportunities impacting the business. 
     Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. As a healthcare provider, we face regulatory requirements in areas of air and water quality control, medical and low-level radioactive waste management and disposal, asbestos management, response to mold and lead-based paint in our facilities and employee safety.
 In our role as owner of subsidiaries which operate our facilities (including our leased facilities), we also may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances that are located on the property, including any such substances that may have migrated off, or discharged or transported from the property. Part of our operations involves the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and/or discharge of hazardous, infectious, toxic, flammable and other hazardous materials, wastes, pollutants or contaminants. These activities may result in damage to individuals, property or the environment; may interrupt operations and/or increase costs; may result in legal liability, damages, injunctions or fines; may result in investigations, administrative proceedings, penalties or other governmental

agency actions; and may not be covered by insurance. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities in the future, and such liabilities may result in material adverse consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations.
     Customers
 With the exception of our rehabilitation therapy services segment, no individual customer or client accounts for a significant portion of our revenue. We do not expect that the loss of a single customer or client within our inpatient services segment would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Within the rehabilitation services business, there are over 180 distinct customers, many of which are chain operators with more than one location.  At December 31, 2018, the four largest customer accounts receivable balances comprised $55.8 million, approximately 52%, of the net outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business. An adverse event impacting the solvency of one or more of these large customers resulting in their insolvency or other economic distress would have a material impact on us.  
     In December 2017, we recorded a $55.0 million non-cash impairment charge to customer receivership and other related charges, related to a customer, which is a related party of ours. This charge reduced the net receivable of the customer to $32.0 million. The customer comprises $32.3 million, approximately 30%, of the net outstanding contract receivables in the rehabilitation services business at December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2018, gross accounts receivable of $58.9 million were converted to a note receivable. The $55.0 million reserve recorded in 2017 was posted against the note receivable. Including the charge above, in the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded customer receivership and other related charges of $90.9 million associated with three rehabilitation therapy services contracts.  See Note 17 – “Related Party Transactions.”
