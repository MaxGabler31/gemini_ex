As of the end of fiscal 2018, we employed 1,631 people in our technology, engineering, and product design functions in the United States, Taiwan, Japan, India, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Armenia.  Our research and development expenses were $363.2 million, $292.3 million, and $311.2 million for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 Intellectual Property Rights
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products.  We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection.  
 As of June 30, 2018, we held 1,748 active patents and 996 pending patent applications worldwide.  Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those for fingerprint sensors, touch controllers, display driver ICs, integrated touch and display controllers, touchpad, far-field voice DSPs, audio codec, multimedia processors and image processors.  Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws.  
 Our extensive array of technologies include those related to integrated circuits (ICs), firmware, software, and mechanical hardware.  Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products.  Furthermore, the lengths of our customers’ design cycles and the customizations required within the products we provide to our customers also serve to protect our intellectual property rights.
 Customers
 Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMS and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers.  Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human interface semiconductor product solutions.  We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions which are focused in several of our target markets, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings.
 Our leading OEM customers in fiscal 2018 included the following:
 
 
• Dell • Google | • Oppo Mobile • Samsung 
• Hewlett-Packard | • Sony 
• Huawei | • Vivo 
• Lenovo | • Xiaomi 
• LG Electronics | 

 
We generally supply custom-designed products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chain or distributors.  Sales to Sanshin Electronics Co., Ltd. and Sharp Corporation accounted for 15% and 12%, respectively, of our net revenue in fiscal 2018.  
 We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors.  Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human interface semiconductor product solutions in their products.  The contract manufacturers and distributors place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases.  The majority of these customers do not have return rights except for warranty provisions.
 Strategic Relationships
 We have used strategic relationships to enhance our ability to offer value-added customer solutions in the past. We intend to enter additional strategic relationships with companies that may help us serve our target markets.
 13


Sales and Marketing
 We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers.  We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value added resellers.  Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions.  Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process.
 As of the end of fiscal 2018, we employed 279 sales and marketing professionals.  We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the United States, Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, and Europe.  In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors which are primarily located in America, China, Korea and Taiwan.
 International sales constituted over 86% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016.   Approximately 75% of our sales in fiscal 2018 were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major notebook computer and mobile product applications OEMs.  Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars.  This information should be read in conjunction with Note 12 Segment, Customers, and Geographic Information to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.
 Manufacturing
 We employ a virtual manufacturing platform through third-party relationships.  We currently utilize a few semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications.  The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution.
 After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers.  During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human interface solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good.  The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products.
 We diversify our production capacity through third-party relationships, thereby strengthening our virtual manufacturing platform.  We believe our virtual manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment.  
 Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements.  We generally do not have long-term agreements with our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules.  Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on  a few sources of supply.  We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available.  We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply.
 Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order.  In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue.  We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations.
 Backlog
 As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had a backlog of orders of $267.3 million, an increase of $45.5 million compared with a backlog of orders as of the end of fiscal 2017 of $221.8 million.  The increase in backlog is primarily due to the number of units being higher in backlog for products ordered by customers at the end of fiscal 2018 than those ordered at the end of 
 14


fiscal 2017, due to our new IoT business, as well as slightly higher average selling prices of products ordered in backlog in our PC and mobile businesses.  Our backlog consists of products for which purchase orders have been received and are scheduled for shipment in the subsequent quarter.  Most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with limited penalties.  Because of the possibility of customer changes in product shipments, our backlog as of a particular date may not necessarily be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.
