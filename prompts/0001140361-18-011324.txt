Item 1.   Business
 Tronox is a public limited company registered under the laws of the State of Western Australia. We are a global leader in the mining of titanium bearing mineral sands and the production of titanium dioxide (TiO2) pigment. Our TiO2 products are critical components of everyday applications such as paint and other coatings, plastics, paper, and other uses. Products we derive from mineral sands include titanium feedstock, zircon, and pig iron. Zircon, a hard, glossy mineral, is used for the manufacture of ceramics, refractories, TV screen glass, and a range of other industrial and chemical products. Pig iron is a metal material used in the steel and metal casting industries to create wrought iron, cast iron, and steel. Titanium feedstock is primarily used to manufacture TiO2 pigment.
 On February 21, 2017, Tronox Limited, The National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., a limited company organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Cristal), and Cristal Inorganic Chemicals Netherlands Coöperatief W.A., a cooperative organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cristal (Seller), entered into a Transaction Agreement (the Transaction Agreement), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Cristals titanium dioxide business for $1.673 billion in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment at closing (the Cash Consideration), plus 37,580,000 Class A ordinary shares (Class A Shares), par value $0.01 per share, of Tronox Limited (the Cristal Transaction). Following the closing of the Cristal Transaction, the Seller will own approximately 24% of the outstanding ordinary shares (including both Class A and Class B) of Tronox Limited. On March 1, 2018, Tronox, Cristal and Seller entered into an Amendment to the Transaction Agreement (the Amendment) that extends the termination date under the Transaction Agreement to June 30, 2018, with automatic 3-month extensions to March 31, 2019, if necessary based on the status of outstanding regulatory approvals. 
 In 2012, our Class B ordinary shares (Class B Shares) were issued to Exxaro Resources Limited (Exxaro) and one of its subsidiaries in consideration for 74% of Exxaros South African mineral sands business (the Exxaro Transaction). On March 8, 2017, Exxaro announced its intention to begin pursuing a path to monetize its ownership stake in Tronox over time. On October 10, 2017, Exxaro sold 22,425,000 Class A ordinary shares (Class A Shares) in an underwritten registered offering (the Exxaro Share Transaction). At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Exxaro held approximately 24% and 44%, respectively, of the voting securities of Tronox Limited. Presently, Exxaro intends to sell the remainder of its Tronox shares in a staged process over time pursuant to the existing registration statement, subject to market conditions. Exxaros sale of Class A Shares does not impact its 26% ownership interest in each of our Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd. and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd. subsidiaries. See Notes 1 and 21 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding Exxaro transactions. 
 Principal Business Segment
 On September 1, 2017, we completed the previously announced sale of our wholly owned subsidiary Tronox Alkali Corporation (Alkali) to Genesis Energy, L.P. for proceeds of $1.325 billion in cash (the Alkali Sale). As a result of the Alkali Sale, Alkalis results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations and we now operate under one operating and reportable segment, TiO2. See Notes 3 and 22 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 TiO2 is used in a wide range of products due to its ability to impart whiteness, brightness, and opacity. TiO2 is used extensively in the manufacture of paint and other coatings, plastics and paper, and in a wide range of other applications, including inks, fibers, rubber, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, it is a critical component of everyday consumer applications due to its superior ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently relative to alternative white pigments and extenders. TiO2 is considered to be a quality

  of life product, and some research indicates that consumption generally increases as disposable income increases. At present, it is our belief that there is no effective mineral substitute for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness, or can be incorporated as cost effectively.

Exploration
 Ilmenite - Ilmenite is the most abundant titanium mineral, with naturally occurring ilmenite having a titanium dioxide content ranging from approximately 45% to 65%, depending on its geological history. The weathering of ilmenite in its natural environment results in oxidation of the iron, which increases titanium content.
 Rutile - Rutile is essentially composed of crystalline titanium dioxide and, in its pure state, would contain close to 100% titanium dioxide. Naturally occurring rutile, however, usually contains minor impurities and therefore, commercial concentrates of this mineral typically contain approximately 94% to 96% titanium dioxide.
 Leucoxene - Leucoxene is a natural alteration of ilmenite with a titanium dioxide content ranging from approximately 65% to 90%. The weathering process is responsible for the alteration of ilmenite to leucoxene, which results in the removal of iron, leading to an upgrade in titanium dioxide content.
 Titanium Slag - The production of titanium slag involves smelting ilmenite in an electric arc furnace under reducing conditions, normally with anthracite (coal) used as a reducing agent. Slag, containing the bulk of the titanium and impurities other than iron, and a high purity pig iron are both produced in this process. The final quality of the slag is highly dependent on the quality of the original ilmenite and the ash composition of the anthracite used in the furnace. Titanium slag has a titanium dioxide content of approximately 75% to 91%. Our slag typically contains 86% to 89% titanium dioxide.
 Titanium Slag Fines - For titanium slag to be suitable for use in the chloride process, it needs to be milled down to a particle size range, which allows it to be processed effectively during the chlorination step of the chloride process. The milling of titanium slag results in the generation of a smaller size than can readily be used by chloride producers, which is separated and sold as a separate product, mostly to pigment producers who operate the sulfate process.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Synthetic Rutile - A number of processes have been developed for the beneficiation of ilmenite into products containing between approximately 90% and 95% titanium dioxide. These products are known as synthetic rutile or upgraded ilmenite. The processes employed vary in terms of the extent to which the ilmenite grain is reduced, and the precise nature of the reducing reaction and the conditions used in the subsequent removal of iron. All of the existing commercial processes are based on the reduction of ilmenite in a rotary kiln, followed by leaching under various conditions to remove the iron from the reduced ilmenite grains. Our synthetic rutile has a titanium dioxide content of approximately 90% to 93%.
 Zircon - Zircon is often, but not always, found in the mineral sands deposits containing ilmenite. It is extracted, alongside ilmenite and rutile, as part of the initial mineral sands beneficiation process.
Mining
 The mining of mineral sands deposits is conducted either wet, by dredging or hydraulic water jets, or dry, using earth-moving equipment to excavate and transport the sands. Dredging, as used at the Cooljarloo mine, is generally the favored method of mining mineral sands, provided that the ground conditions are suitable and water is readily available. In situations involving hard ground, discontinuous ore bodies, small tonnage, high slimes contents or very high grades, dry mining techniques are generally preferred.
 Dredge Mining - Dredge mining, or wet mining, is best suited to ore reserves located below the water table. A floating dredge removes the ore from the bottom of an artificial pond through a large suction pipe. The bulk sand material is fed as slurry through a primary, or wet, concentrator that is typically towed behind the dredge unit. The dredge slowly advances across the pond and deposits clean sand tailings behind the pond for subsequent revegetation and rehabilitation. Because of the high capital cost involved in the manufacturing and location, dredge mining is most suitable for large, long-life deposits. The dredging operations at Cooljarloo use two large floating dredges in a purpose-built pond. The slurry is pumped to a floating concentrator, which recovers heavy minerals from the sand and clay.
 Hydraulic Mining - At our Fairbreeze mine in KZN, we employ a hydraulic mining method for mineral sands due to the topography of the ore body and the ore characteristics. A jet of high-pressure water is aimed at the mining face, thereby cutting into and loosening the sand so that it collapses on the floor. The water acts as a carrier medium for the sand, due to the high fines (mineral particles that are too fine to be economically extracted and other materials that remain after the valuable fraction of an ore has been separated from the uneconomic fraction) content contained in the ore body. The slurry generated by the hydraulic monitors flows to a collection sump where oversize material is removed and the slurry is then pumped to the primary concentration plant.
 Dry Mining - Dry mining is suitable where mineral deposits are shallow, contain hard bands of rock, or are in a series of unconnected ore bodies. Dry mining is performed at Namakwa Sands, which is located in an arid region on the west coast of South Africa. The ore is mined with front end loaders in a load and carry operation, dumping the mineral bearing sands onto a conveyor belt system that follows behind the mining face. The harder layers are mined using hydraulic excavators in a backhoe configuration or by bulldozer. Namakwa Sands does not use blasting in its operations. The mined material is transported by trucks to the mineral sizers where primary reduction takes place.
Processing and Mineral Separation
 Processing - Both wet and dry mining techniques utilize wet concentrator plants to produce a high grade of heavy mineral concentrate (typically approximately 90% to 98% heavy mineral content). Screened ore is first deslimed, a process by which slimes are separated from larger particles of minerals, and then washed through a series of spiral separators that use gravity to separate the heavy mineral sands from lighter materials, such as quartz. Residue from the concentration process is pumped back into either the open pits or slimes dams for rehabilitation and water recovery. Water used in the process is recycled into a clean water dam with any additional water requirements made up from pit dewatering or rainfall.
 Mineral Separation - The non-magnetic (zircon and rutile) and magnetic (ilmenite) concentrates are passed through a dry separation process, known as the dry mill to separate out the minerals. Electrostatic and dry magnetic methods are used to further separate the ilmenite, rutile and zircon. Electrostatic separation relies on the difference in surface conductivity of the materials to be separated. Conductive minerals (such as ilmenite, rutile

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  and leucoxene) behave differently from non-conductive minerals (such as zircon) when subjected to electrical forces. Magnetic separation techniques are dependent on the iron content of a mineral. Magnetic minerals (such as ilmenite) will separate from non-magnetic minerals (such as rutile and leucoxene) when subjected to a magnetic field. A combination of gravity and magnetic separation is used to separate zircon from the non-magnetic portion of the heavy mineral concentrate. The heavy mineral concentrate at KZN Sands and Namakwa Sands is passed through wet high-intensity magnetic separation to produce a non-magnetic fraction and a magnetic fraction.
 Production of titanium feedstock, pig iron, and zircon
 Our TiO2 operations have a combined annual production capacity of approximately 721,000 metric tons (MT) of titanium feedstock, which is comprised of 91,000 MT of rutile and leucoxene, 220,000 MT of synthetic rutile, and 410,000 MT of titanium slag. Our TiO2 operations also have the capability to produce approximately 220,000 MT of zircon and 221,000 MT of pig iron.
 Synthetic Rutile Production - Ilmenite may also be upgraded into synthetic rutile. Synthetic rutile, or upgraded ilmenite, is a chemically modified form of ilmenite that has the majority of the ferrous, non-titanium components removed, and is also suitable for use in the production of titanium metal or TiO2 using the chloride process. Ilmenite is converted to synthetic rutile in a two-stage pyrometallurgical and chemical process. The first stage involves heating ilmenite in a large rotary kiln. Coal is used as a heat source and, when burned in an oxygen deficient environment, it produces carbon monoxide, which promotes a reducing environment that converts the iron oxide contained in the ilmenite to metallic iron. The intermediate product, called reduced ilmenite, is a highly magnetic sand grain due to the presence of the metallic iron. The second stage involves the conversion of reduced ilmenite to synthetic rutile by removing the metallic iron from the reduced ilmenite grain. This conversion is achieved through aeration (oxidation), accelerated through the use of ammonium chloride as a catalyst, and acid leaching of the iron to dissolve it out of the reduced ilmenite. Activated carbon is also produced as a co-product of the synthetic rutile production process.
 Titanium Feedstock - Ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, titanium slag and synthetic rutile are all used primarily as feedstock for the production of TiO2. Titanium feedstock can be segmented based on the level of titanium contained within the feedstock, with substantial overlap between each segment. Different grades of titanium feedstock have similar characteristics. As such, TiO2 producers generally source and supply a variety of feedstock grades, and often blend them into one feedstock. The lower amount of titanium used in the TiO2 manufacturing process, the more feedstock required and waste material produced. Naturally occurring high-grade titanium minerals required for the production of TiO2 are limited in supply. Two processes have been developed commercially: one for the production of titanium slag and the other for the production of synthetic rutile. Both processes use ilmenite as a raw material, and involve the removal of iron oxides and other non-titanium material.
 Titanium Slag - Ilmenite at KZN Sands and Namakwa Sands is processed further through direct current arc furnaces to produce titanium slag with a titanium content of approximately 86% to 89%. The smelting process comprises the reduction of ilmenite to produce titanium slag and pig iron. Ilmenite and anthracite are fed in a tightly controlled ratio into an operating furnace where the endothermic reduction of ilmenite occurs. The resultant titanium slag has a lower density than the iron, and separation of the two liquid products occurs inside the furnace. The slag and iron are tapped periodically from separate sets of tapholes located around the circumference of the furnace. Slag is tapped into steel pots and cooled for several hours in the pots before the slag blocks are tipped out. The blocks are subsequently transported to the blockyard where they are cooled under water sprays for a number of days. They are then crushed, milled, and separated according to size fractions, as required by the customers. The tapped pig iron is re-carburized, de-sulfurized, and cast into ingots or pigs.
 High Purity Pig Iron - The process by which ilmenite is converted into titanium slag results in the production of high purity iron containing low levels of manganese. When iron is produced in this manner, the molten iron is tapped from the ilmenite furnace during the smelting process, alloyed by adding carbon and silicon and treated to reduce the sulfur content, and is then cast into pigs. The pig iron produced as a co-product of our titanium slag production is known as low manganese pig iron.
 Zircon - Zircon (ZrSiO4) is a co-product of mining mineral sands deposits for titanium feedstock. Zircon is primarily used as an additive in ceramic glazes to add hardness, which makes the ceramic glaze more water, chemical and abrasion resistant. It is also used for the production of zirconium metal and zirconium chemicals, in refractories, as molding sand in foundries, and for TV screen glass, where it is noted for its structural stability at

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  high temperatures and resistance to abrasive and corrosive conditions. Zircon typically represents a relatively low proportion of the in-situ heavy mineral sands deposits, but has a relatively higher value compared to other heavy mineral products. Refractories containing zircon are expensive and are only used in demanding, high-wear and corrosive applications in the glass, steel and cement industries. Foundry applications use zircon when casting articles of high quality and value where accurate sizing is crucial, such as aerospace, automotive, medical, and other high-end applications.
Competitive Conditions
 Globally, there are a small number of large mining companies or groups that are involved in the production of titanium feedstock and these are dominated by close relationships between miners and consumers (predominately pigment producers).
 Production and Marketing of TiO2
 We operate three TiO2 pigment facilities at the following locations: Hamilton, Mississippi; Botlek, the Netherlands; and Kwinana, Western Australia, representing an aggregate annual TiO2 production capacity of 465,000 MT.
 Production
 TiO2 is produced using a combination of processes involving the manufacture of base pigment particles followed by surface treatment, drying and milling (collectively known as finishing). Two commercial production processes are used by manufacturers: the chloride process and the sulphate process. All of our TiO2 is produced using the chloride process. We are one of a limited number of TiO2 producers in the world with chloride production technology. We believe that we are one of the largest global producers and marketers of TiO2 manufactured via chloride technology. TiO2 produced using the chloride process is preferred for some of the largest end-use applications.
 In the chloride process, high quality feedstock (slag, synthetic rutile, natural rutile or, in limited cases, high titanium content ilmenite ores) are reacted with chlorine (the chlorination step) and carbon to form titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) in a continuous fluid bed reactor. Purification of TiCl4 to remove other chlorinated products is accomplished using a distillation process. The purified TiCl4 is then oxidized in a vapor phase form to produce raw pigment particles and chlorine gas. The latter is recycled back to the chlorination step for reuse. Raw pigment is then typically slurried with water and dispersants prior to entering the finishing step. The chloride process currently accounts for substantially all of the industry-wide TiO2 production capacity in North America, and approximately 46% of industry-wide capacity globally.
 Commercial production of TiO2 results in one of two different crystal forms: rutile, which is manufactured using either the chloride process or the sulphate process, or anatase, which is only produced using the sulfate process. All of our global production capacity utilizes the chloride process to produce rutile TiO2. Rutile TiO2 is preferred over anatase TiO2 for many of the largest end-use applications, such as coatings and plastics, because its higher refractive index imparts better hiding power at lower quantities than the anatase crystal form and it is more suitable for outdoor use because it is more durable. Although rutile TiO2 can be produced using either the chloride process or the sulphate process, some customers prefer rutile produced using the chloride process because it typically has a bluer undertone and greater durability.
 The primary raw materials used in the production of TiO2 include titanium feedstock, chlorine and coke. Chemicals used in the production of TiO2 include oxygen and nitrogen. Other chemicals used in the production of TiO2 are purchased from various companies under long-term supply contracts. In the past, we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into in the near term, to meet our requirements over the next several years.
 Marketing
 We supply and market TiO2 under the brand name TRONOX® to approximately 700 customers in approximately 100 countries, including market leaders in each of the key end-use markets for TiO2, and we have supplied each of our top ten customers with TiO2 for more than 10 years. For information regarding 2017 sales volume by geography and end-use market, see section Segment and Geographic Revenue Information.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In addition to price and product quality, we compete on the basis of technical support and customer service. Our direct sales and technical service organizations execute our sales and marketing strategy, and work together to provide quality customer service. Our direct sales staff is trained in all of our products and applications. Due to the technical requirements of TiO2 applications, our technical service organization and direct sales offices are supported by a regional customer service staff located in each of our major geographic markets.
 Our three TiO2 production facilities are strategically positioned in key geographies. The Hamilton facility located in Mississippi USA, is one of the largest TiO2 production facilities in the world, and has the size and scale to service customers in North America and around the globe. Our Kwinana plant, located in Australia, is well positioned to service the growing demand from Asia. Our Botlek facility, located in the Netherlands, services our European customers and certain specialized applications globally.
 Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on effective customer management through the development of strong relationships. We develop customer relationships and manage customer contact through our sales team, technical service organization, research and development team, customer service team, plant operations personnel, supply chain specialists, and senior management visits. We believe that multiple points of customer contact facilitate efficient problem solving, supply chain support, formula optimization and co-development of products.
 The global market in which our TiO2 business operates is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face competition not only from chloride process pigment producers, but from sulfate process pigment producers as well. Moreover, because transportation costs are minor relative to the cost of our product, there is also competition between products produced in one region versus products produced in another region.
 We face competition from competitors with facilities in multiple regions, including Chemours, Cristal Global, Venator and Kronos Worldwide Inc. In addition to the major competitors discussed above, we compete with numerous regional producers, including producers in China such as Lomon Billions, CNNC and Blue Star.
 Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide Manufacturing and Marketing
 Our electrolytic and other chemical products operations are primarily focused on advanced battery materials and specialty boron products.
 Electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) - EMD is the active cathode material for alkaline batteries used in flashlights, electronic games, and medical and industrial devices. We believe that we are one of the largest producers of EMD for the global alkaline battery industry. EMD quality requirements for alkaline technology are much more demanding than for zinc carbon technology and, as a result, alkaline-grade EMD commands a higher price than zinc carbon-grade EMD. The United States (U.S.) primary battery market, predominantly based on alkaline-grade EMD, is the largest in the world followed by China and Japan according to publicly available industry reports. As such, we expect demand for alkaline-grade EMD to be flat as the demand stabilizes for devices using primary batteries.
 Boron - Specialty boron product end-use applications include semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, high-performance fibers, specialty ceramics and epoxies, as well as igniter formulations. According to publicly available industry reports, we are one of the leading suppliers of boron trichloride, along with JSC Aviabor, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, and several Asian manufacturers. We anticipate demand for boron trichloride will remain positive, driven primarily by the growth of the semiconductor industry.
Research and Development
 We have research and development facilities that service our products, and focus on applied research and development of both new and existing processes. Our research and development facilities supporting our mineral sands business are located in South Africa, while the majority of scientists supporting our pigment and electrolytic research and development efforts are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA. 
 New process developments are focused on increased throughput, efficiency gains and general processing equipment-related improvements. Ongoing development of process technology contributes to cost reduction, enhanced production flexibility, increased capacity, and improved consistency of product quality. In 2017, our product development and commercialization efforts were focused on several TiO2 products that deliver added value to customers across all end use segments by way of enhanced properties of the pigment.

  Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Other Intellectual Property Rights
 Protection of our proprietary intellectual property is important to our business. At December 31, 2017, we held 38 U.S. patents, 6 patent applications, and approximately 217 in foreign counterparts, including both issued patents and pending patent applications. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging through 2035. Additionally, we have 5 trademark registrations in the U.S., as well as 54 trademark counterpart registrations in foreign jurisdictions.
 We rely upon, and have taken steps to secure our unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets. The substantial majority of business patents relate to our chloride products and production technology. Our proprietary chloride production technology is an important part of our overall technology position. However, much of the fundamental intellectual property associated with both chloride and sulfate pigment production is no longer subject to patent protection. At Namakwa Sands, we rely on intellectual property for our smelting technology, which was granted to us in perpetuity by Anglo American South Africa Limited for use on a worldwide basis, pursuant to a non-exclusive license. 
 We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell, and have developed value in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks; however, there can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted. The same can be said for our patents and patent applications, which may in the future be the subject of a challenge regarding validity as well as ownership, requiring a defense of the patent/application through legal proceedings, which inherently introduce a degree of business uncertainty and risk. We also use and rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. We conduct research activities and protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures. While certain patents held for our products and production processes are important to our long-term success, more important is the operational knowledge we possess.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, Tronox had approximately 3,400 employees worldwide, of which 700 are located in the U.S., 600 in Australia, 1,800 in South Africa, and 300 in the Netherlands and other international locations. Our TiO2 segment employees in the U.S. are not represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement. In South Africa, approximately 73% of our workforce belongs to a union. In Australia, most employees are not currently represented by a union, but approximately 46% are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In the Netherlands, approximately 49% of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and 27% are members of a union. We consider relations with our employees and labor organizations to be good.
Environmental, Health and Safety Authorizations
 Mining
 Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety regulations in South Africa and Australia. These regulations include those relating to mine rehabilitation, liability provision, water management, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and occupational health and safety. The various legislation and regulations are subject to a number of internal and external audits. We believe our mineral sands operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with existing health, safety and environmental legislation and regulations.
Regulation of the Mining Industry in South Africa
 There are numerous mining-related laws and regulatory authorizations that may impact the performance of our business. These include but are not limited to: the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Royalty Act, which imposes a royalty on refined and unrefined minerals payable to the South African government; the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development ACT (the MPRDA), which governs the acquisition, use and disposal of mineral rights; the South African Minerals Act, which requires each new mine to prepare an Environmental Management Program Report for approval by the South African Department of Mineral Reserves (DMR); the Revised South African Mining Charter, effective September 2010, which requires, among other conditions, that mining entities achieve a 26% historically disadvantaged persons ownership of mining assets and the Black

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Economic Empowerment (BEE) legislation in South Africa. The DMR has proposed changes to the mining charter that would make requirements more stringent. These changes are being challenged by the Chamber of Mines, an industry employers organization representing South African mining companies, the outcome of which is uncertain. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Regulation of the Mining Industry in Australia
 Mining operations in Western Australia are subject to a variety of environmental protection regulations including but not limited to: the Environmental Protection Act (the EPA), the primary source of environmental regulation in Western Australia, and, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), which established the federal environment protection regime and prohibits the carrying out of a controlled action that may have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance.
 Prescriptive legislation regulates health and safety at mining workplaces in Western Australia. The principal general occupational health and safety legislation and regulations are the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (WA), the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 1996 (WA) and the guidelines. The Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA) and Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 (WA) and guidelines provide the relevant legislation for mining operations in Western Australia. The Dangerous Goods Act 2004 (WA) applies to the safe storage, handling and transport of dangerous goods.
 Each Australian state and territory has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and mining of minerals. Our operations are principally regulated by the Western Australian Mining Act 1978 (WA) and the Mining Regulations 1981 (WA).
 State Agreements are contracts between the State of Western Australia and the proponents of major resources projects, and are intended to foster resource development and related infrastructure investments. These agreements are approved and ratified by the Parliament of Western Australia. The State Agreement relevant to our Australian operations and our production of mineral sands is the agreement authorized by the Mineral Sands (Cooljarloo) Mining and Processing Agreement Act 1988 (WA). State Agreements may only be amended by mutual consent, which reduces the sovereign risk and increases the security of tenure, however Parliament may enact legislation that overrules or amends the particular State Agreement.
 Regulation of Finished Product Manufacturing
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governments. Governmental authorities regulate the generation and treatment of waste and air emissions at our operations and facilities. At many of our operations, we also comply with worldwide, voluntary standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a nongovernmental organization that promotes the development of standards and serves as a bridging organization for quality and environmental standards, such as ISO 9002 for quality management and ISO 14001 for environmental management.
Chemical Registration
 The European Union (the EU) adopted a regulatory framework for chemicals in 2006 known as Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH). Manufacturers and importers of chemical substances must register information regarding the properties of their existing chemical substances with the European Chemicals Agency. The timeline for existing chemical substances to be registered is based on volume and toxicity. The first group of chemical substances was required to be registered in 2010, with additional registrations due in 2013 and 2018. We registered those products requiring registration by the 2010 and 2013 deadlines. The REACH regulations also require chemical substances, which are newly imported or manufactured in the EU to be registered before being placed on the market. We are now focused on the authorization phase of the REACH process, and are making efforts to address Substances of Very High Concern and evaluating potential business implications. As a chemical manufacturer with global operations, we are also actively monitoring and addressing analogous regulatory regimes being considered or implemented outside of the EU, for example, in Korea and Taiwan.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In May 2016, Frances competent authority under REACH submitted a proposal to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) that would classify TiO2 as carcinogenic to humans by inhalation. The Company together with other companies and trade associations representing the TiO2 industry and industries consuming our products, submitted comments opposing the classification, based on evidence from epidemiological and other scientific studies. On October 12, 2017, ECHAs Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) released a written opinion dated September 14, 2017 stating that based on the scientific evidence it reviewed, there is sufficient grounds to classify TiO2 under the EUs Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP) as a Category 2 Carcinogen, but only with a hazard statement describing the risk by inhalation. The European Commission will review the RACs formal recommendation to determine what regulatory measures, if any, should be taken. If the European Commission decides to adopt this classification, it could require that products manufactured with TiO2 be classified as containing carcinogenic materials, which could impact our business by inhibiting the marketing of products containing TiO2 to consumers, and subject our manufacturing operations to new regulations that could increase costs. Any classification, use restriction or authorized requirement for use imposed by the ECHA could have additional effects under other EU laws (e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives) and/or trigger heightened regulatory scrutiny in countries and local jurisdictions outside the EU based on health and safety grounds. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny would lead to claims by consumers or those involved in the production of such products alleging adverse health impacts. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Greenhouse Gas Regulation
 Globally, our operations are subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). We currently report and manage GHG emissions as required by law for sites located in areas requiring such managing and reporting (EU/Australia). While the U.S. has not adopted any federal climate change legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has introduced some GHG programs. For example, under the EPAs GHG Tailoring Rule, expansions or new construction could be subject to the Clean Air Acts Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements. Some of our facilities are currently subject to GHG emissions monitoring and reporting. Changes or additional requirements due to GHG regulations could impact our capital and operating costs; however, it is not possible at the present time to estimate any financial impact to these U.S. operating sites. Also, some in the scientific community believe that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere may result in climatic changes. Depending on the severity of climatic changes, our operations could be adversely affected. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
