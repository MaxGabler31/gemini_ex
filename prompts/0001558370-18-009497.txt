 Item 1.    Business
 Overview 
 We are headquartered in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and have operations in North America, Asia, and Europe.  Today we serve two distinct and unrelated markets; the semiconductor capital equipment market and the life sciences sample management market. We believe our leadership positions and our global support capability in each of these markets make us a valued business partner to the largest semiconductor capital equipment device makers, and pharmaceutical and life science research institutions in the world. Our offerings are also applied to other adjacent technology and industrial markets. We provide customer support services for our products globally.  In total, we employ approximately 1,550 regular full-time employees worldwide and have sales in more than 50 countries.
 Since our founding in 1978, we have been a leading partner to the global semiconductor manufacturing markets. In our early days of our business, we developed and marketed automated handling equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. Since then, we have expanded our products and services through product development initiatives and acquisitions, and we are now recognized as a leading provider of vacuum robots, vacuum automation systems, wafer carrier contamination control systems, and reticle storage solutions to the global semiconductor capital equipment industry.  Over the last three fiscal years, we acquired one company to support the semiconductor market: Tec-Sem Group AG, a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fabrication automation equipment with a focus on reticle storage management, which we acquired in April 2018. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we made several acquisitions to support our business in the semiconductor market, some of which are described further in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  We have invested in research and development initiatives to advance the offerings acquired in these acquisitions, as well as vacuum automation and services offerings. Our

business supporting the semiconductor capital equipment and adjacent markets provided approximately 69% of our revenue in fiscal year 2018.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for approximately $675.0 million in cash subject to customary adjustments.  We originally acquired the cryogenics business in 2005 as part of the acquisition of Helix Technology Corporation.  The closing of our sale of the cryogenics business is subject to various closing conditions and regulatory approvals.  As part of this sale, we will transfer our intellectual property, or IP, for our cryogenics pump products, but not our IP related to our semiconductor automation or life sciences businesses.  The semiconductor cryogenics business has been classified as discontinued operations and, unless otherwise noted, the description of our business in this report relates solely to our continuing operations and does not include the operations of our semiconductor cryogenics business. 
 We have served the life sciences sample management market since 2011.  The original strategic linkage between this business and our semiconductor business was our ability to leverage our core technology competencies in automation and cryogenics.  In life sciences, we applied these competencies to provide automated ultra-cold freezer systems and then to expand into a portfolio of products and services to assist customers in efficiently managing the end-to-end “cold chain of custody” of their compound and biological samples.  Today, we are a leading provider of the life sciences sample management solutions for automated cold sample stores, off-site storage services, and consumables and instruments. We are also a provider of software offerings which enable or enhance our customers’ visibility into their sample inventories, and laboratory services at our storage service locations, both of which are expected to help our customers accelerate their research and development efforts.  Taken together, we believe our life sciences product and services offerings allow our customers to maintain a complete “cold chain of custody” and related workflow solutions for their samples. Our business supporting the life science sample management market provided approximately 31% of our revenue in fiscal year 2018.
 Our life sciences sample management product and service solutions portfolio are a result of strategic acquisitions and internal research and development initiatives.  Our competencies in automation and cryogenics provided us a differentiated capability to advance the product set with higher functioning automation, automation-ready consumables, and management of samples and automation in ultra-cold environments.  We leveraged the storage solutions acquired before 2013 and our expertise and developed and commercialized a full line of advanced automated ultra-cold freezer offerings.  The Twinbank™ platform was launched in 2014 and sells under two primary offerings, the SampleStoreTM II which provides -20°C high volume storage for chemical compounds and the BioStoreTM II which provides -80°C high volume storage for biological samples.  In 2016, we launched the BioStoreTM III Cryo, a smaller, automated, liquid nitrogen-cooled freezer that operates at temperatures as low as -196°C for automated storage of the most temperature sensitive of biological samples.  We also expanded our consumables and instruments offerings with development of new products, and have successfully commercialized BioStudies, a bioinformatics software platform that enables customers to manage sample collections and development efforts distributed across the globe. 
 In the last three fiscal years, we have completed six acquisitions of companies or assets to expand and enhance our life science offerings. These include three companies providing off-site storage and sample management services.  

· | In November of 2015, we acquired BioStorage Technologies, Inc., a full-service outsourcing sample management business, supporting customers in the United States, Europe, and Asia with an integrated solution for off-site storage services, transportation services, laboratory services and software-based inventory management.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In July 2017, we acquired assets and liabilities of Pacific Bio-Material Management, Inc. and Novare, LLC, two companies with operations in California and New York, respectively, providing off-site storage, transportation, and management services for biological samples.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In April 2018, we acquired BioSpeciMan Corporation, a Canada-based provider of off-site storage services for biological sample materials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The recent acquisitions in life sciences also added cryogenic temperature management products, software products and consumable products to our portfolio. 

· | In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Cool Lab, LLC, a subsidiary of BioCision, LLC, a provider of cryogenic product solutions that assist in managing temperature stability of biological samples in a laboratory environment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In August 2017, we acquired certain assets and liabilities from RURO, Inc related to FreezerPro®, a web-based software platform which aids customers in their sample management needs and became the exclusive distributor of BiobankPro®, a software system that manages sample processing and storage while providing a single location for research and clinical data and related analysis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In October 2017, we acquired 4titude Limited, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables used in a variety of genomic analytical applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  On September 26, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GENEWIZ Group, or GENEWIZ, a leading provider of genomic services, based in New Jersey with operations throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe.  We completed this acquisition on November 15, 2018.  Please refer to Note 23, “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 Through the acquisitions described above, we have expanded product offerings, accelerated product development cycles, broadened our installed base and added customer relationships to our business. We have also divested certain products that did not hold leadership positions in our core markets.  As such, we use acquisitions and divestitures to strengthen our portfolio and achieve increased growth and profitability. For further information on our acquisitions and equity investments, please refer to Note 4, "Acquisitions," and Note 8, "Equity Method and Other Investments," to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10‑K.

We believe the life science sample management market is generally more stable than the semiconductor capital equipment market and we expect that it will grow more quickly than our semiconductor business as a result of the expanding need for storage and retention of compound and biological samples. In the life science market, revenue streams from storage services are more predictable than the sale of automated freezers and other equipment. As we have expanded our life science offerings of consumables, infrastructure services and storage services, we have seen these more stable revenue streams increase to account for approximately 56% of our Brooks Life Sciences segment revenue in fiscal year 2018.
 Segments
 We have two operating and reportable segments consisting of Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and Brooks Life Sciences segment. For further information on our operating segments, please refer to Note 20, "Segment and Geographic Information" to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under "Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10‑K.

Markets and Customers
 The demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical, resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market. While the services element of our semiconductor business is generally more stable, the cyclical nature of the capital equipment business causes sales from products to vary quarterly based on short-term market demands. It is not unusual for these variations in sales to be up or down 10% to 20% in sequential quarters. 
 The principal markets served by the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment include the following:

· | Semiconductor capital equipment market
--+---------------------------------------

  Each year, the global semiconductor industry makes significant capital investments in equipment to keep up with advancements in semiconductor technology, to add manufacturing capacity and to improve productivity within existing fabs. We are recognized as a market leader in three critical sub-segments: vacuum automation for wafer handling; contamination control; and automation for advanced packaging. As discussed above, the global semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical, but we believe that it possesses a long-term growth profile driven by the demand for increasingly sophisticated consumer electronics, automotive and smart appliance products, growth in data centers, the expansion of the Internet-of-Things which increasingly connects various appliances and devices to servers, and mobile platforms. The demand for higher performance, lower power consumption and reduced size for all of these products is enabled by advancements in the technology and processes used for the manufacturing of the devices. We believe this trend continues to provide market opportunities for the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group to be a valued partner in providing vacuum automation, carrier contamination control and automation for advanced packaging to support the industry’s needs.
 We have been a long-term partner to device manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, who are the providers of tools to fabs. We maintain collaborative relationships with our customers for the innovative design of solutions that enable our customers to have a valued wafer process advantage and improved cost of ownership in the fab. Our global network of technical specialists provides extensive support to our customers in all regions, including the key semiconductor markets in Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan, Europe and the United States.
 The production of advanced semiconductor chips requires many complex and logistically challenging manufacturing activities. Silicon wafers must go through hundreds of process steps in order to create billions of microscopic transistors and connect them in both horizontal and vertical layers to produce a functioning integrated circuit, or IC. These initial fabrication steps, which are referred to in the industry as front-end processes, are repeated many times on a single wafer to create the desired pattern on the silicon wafer. Up to 50% of these processes are performed in tools that operate under vacuum conditions, such as removing, depositing, or measuring materials on wafer surfaces. As the complexity of semiconductors has increased, the number of process steps that occur in a vacuum environment have also increased, resulting in a greater need for vacuum automation technology solutions.
 The increase in packing density of components in mobile devices has led the industry to devise new advanced packaging techniques for chip interconnectivity using what is called wafer level packaging, or WLP. This advanced packaging technology is a process of combining multiple wafers together prior to cutting them into pieces and then forming them onto a packaging substrate where they are ultimately divided into the multitude of chips. The recent 

 
  6

 
increased adoption of WLP has increased the need for a contaminant free and high purity manufacturing environment, resulting in higher demand for our semiconductor offerings tailored to handle full wafer forms.
 In addition to the more complex automation challenges brought by technology shifts in device and packaging structures, there is also an increased demand for wafer carrier devices that provide safe and clean transport of wafers between tools during the manufacturing process. Large scale semiconductor fabs may use thousands of these carriers. There is also growing demand for wafer carrier cleaning and conditioning tools used to remove microscopic particles, organic compounds and water that are attracted to the inside surface of the carrier. Automated cleaning and conditioning of the carrier devices are also in demand by customers looking to improve yields.  Similarly, as Lithography also requires cleaner controlled environments, our reticles solutions provide contamination control for highly valued reticles or masks that are used in printing the technological features onto the wafer.  

· | Adjacent capital equipment markets
--+-----------------------------------

  There are a few adjacent and capital equipment markets that use manufacturing processes similar to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. These markets include microelectromechanical devices, or MEMs, light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLEDs, and touch screen technology. These markets and semiconductor capital equipment market share common customers and utilize similar technology applications. For example, LEDs are manufactured using vacuum systems and handling processes similar to those used in semiconductor manufacturing. 
 We believe the desire for efficient, higher throughput and extremely clean manufacturing for semiconductor wafer fabs, the chip packaging process and other industrial or high performance electronic-based products and processes have created a substantial market for us in the following offerings: (i) substrate handling automation, which is related to moving the wafers in a semiconductor fab, (ii) tool automation, which moves wafers from station-to-station, (iii) vacuum systems technology to create and sustain the clean environment necessary for fabricating various products, and (iv) automated contamination control systems to clean and condition wafer carriers.
