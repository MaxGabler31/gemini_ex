ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Overview
 
Gulf West Security Network, Inc. (a Nevada Corporation), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, formerly known as “Gulf West Security Network, Inc.” (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Gulf West”, “GWSN”, or the “Company”), are principally engaged in providing residential and commercial electronic security, home automation, and systems integration services on both a retail and wholesale basis.
 
The Company’s retail division, which includes its wholly-owned subsidiary LJR Security Services, Inc. (a Louisiana Corporation) (“LJR”), is actively engaged in the hands-on design, engineering, sales, installation, after-market servicing, inspection and remote electronic monitoring of home (residential) burglar, fire and medical alarm systems as well as fully-integrated business (commercial) security and automation systems in the United States.
 
The Company’s wholesale division, which operates under the name Gulf West Security Network (or “Gulf West”), is further engaged in the development and expansion of a proprietary coalition (alliance or network) of independently-branded life safety and property protection providers, fire alert and suppression system installers, electronic remote monitoring and video surveillance specialists, smart home designers, commercial systems integrators, structured wiring professionals and electrical contractors.
 
Merger
 
On August 9, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary NuLife Acquisition Corp. (“NuLife Sub”) approved and executed an agreement of merger and plan of reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), to become effective at such time as the articles of merger have been filed with the Secretary of State of Louisiana (the “Effective Time”), and after the satisfaction or waiver by the parties thereto of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and in exchange for all one hundred (100) issued and outstanding shares of LJR Security Services, Inc. (“LJR”), LJR received one thousand (1,000) shares of series D senior convertible preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) of the Company, convertible into fifty million two hundred thirty-nine thousand five hundred forty-one (50,239,541) shares of common stock of the Company. In addition, the LJR shareholder received one share of series C super-voting preferred stock of NuLife which granted the holder 50.1% of the votes of NuLife at all times.
 
The merger was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby LJR was considered the accounting acquirer and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger”, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger have been replaced with the historical financial statements of LJR prior to the reverse merger. The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements.
 
Restatement of Articles of Incorporation
 
On September 19, 2018, LJR Security Services, Inc. amended and restated its articles of incorporation providing for a change in the Company’s name to “Gulf West Security Network, Inc.” The Company’s authorized shares of common stock, preferred stock and the par value of the stock will remain unchanged. The Company also amended and restated its bylaws to reflect the name change.
 
On September 20, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company designated one (1) share of Series C Preferred Stock (the “Series C Stock”) and on thousand (1,000) shares of Series D Preferred Stock (the “Series D Stock”). The classes of Series C Stock and Series D Stock were created in anticipation of the closing of the Merger Agreement.
 
Change of Fiscal Year
 
On September 28, 2018, the Company’s Board approved a change in fiscal year end from September 30th to December 31st. The decision to change the fiscal year end was related to the recent merger of the Company with LJR to closely align its operations and internal controls with that of its wholly owned subsidiary LJR.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had two employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis.
