Overview
 Pzena Investment Management, Inc. was formed in 2007 and is the sole managing member of Pzena Investment Management, LLC, which is our operating company.  Founded in 1995, Pzena Investment Management, LLC is a value-oriented investment management company.  We believe that we have established a positive, team-oriented culture that enables us to attract and retain highly qualified people.  Since our inception, over twenty years ago, we have built a diverse, global client base of respected and sophisticated institutional investors, select third-party distributed mutual funds for which we act as sub-investment adviser, and funds for which we act as investment adviser.
 Pzena Investment Management, LLC is comprised of Class A and Class B membership units, each of which have an identical economic interest in the operating company.  As a holding company, we hold all of the Class A membership units and recognize income generated from our economic interest in our operating company's net income.  The Class B membership units of the operating company are held by employees and certain outside members.  For each Class A membership unit held, we have issued one corresponding share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which entitles the holder to one vote per share.  For each Class B membership unit, we have issued one corresponding share of Class B common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, which entitles the holder to five votes per share without dividend rights, as described below in the graphic illustration.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 26.4% of the economic interest in our operating company and our Class A shareholders hold approximately 6.7% of our voting interests.
 Pzena Investment Management, Inc. also serves as the general partner of Pzena Investment Management, LP, a partnership formed with the objective of aggregating employee ownership in one entity.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
We utilize a classic value approach to investing and seek to make investments in good businesses at low prices, which requires:
  
• | willingness to invest in companies before their stock prices reflect signs of business improvement, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant patience, based upon our understanding of the business’ fundamentals, and our long-term investment horizon.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our approach and process aim to achieve attractive returns over the long term.  We manage assets in value-oriented investment strategies reflecting varying degrees of portfolio concentrations across a wide range of market capitalizations in both U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets.
 Our assets under management, or AUM, was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2018, and we managed money on behalf of institutions, acted as sub-investment adviser to a variety of SEC-registered mutual funds and non-U.S. funds as well as investment adviser to Pzena SEC-registered mutual funds, certain private placement funds, and non-U.S. funds.
 Our operating company is led by a committee, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Richard S. Pzena; each of our Presidents, Messrs. John P. Goetz and William L. Lipsey; and our Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mr. Gary J. Bachman (the "Executive Committee").
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following are our competitive strengths:
  
• | Focus on Investment Excellence. We recognize that we must achieve investment excellence in order to attain long-term business success. All of our business decisions, including the design of our investment process and our willingness to limit AUM in our investment strategies, are focused on producing attractive long-term investment results. We believe that our long-term investment performance, together with our willingness to close our strategies to new investors in order to optimize the prospects for future performance, has contributed to our positive reputation among our clients and the institutional consultants who advise them. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consistency of Investment Process. Since our inception over twenty years ago, we have utilized a classic value investment approach and a systematic, disciplined investment process to construct portfolios for our investment strategies in U.S. and non-U.S. markets across all market capitalizations. The consistency of our process has allowed us to leverage the same investment team to launch new strategies. We believe that our consistent investment process has resulted in our strong brand recognition in the investment community. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diverse and High Quality Client Base. We believe that we have developed a favorable reputation in the institutional investment community. This is evidenced by our strong relationships with institutional investors, investment consultants, and mutual fund providers, as well as the diversity and sophistication of our investors. For more information concerning our client base, see “Our Client Relationships and Distribution Approach” below. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced Investment Professionals and a Team-Oriented Approach. We believe that our greatest asset is the experience of the individuals on our team. For more information on our investment team, see “Our Investment Team” below. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee Retention. We have focused on building an environment that we believe is attractive to talented investment professionals. Important among our practices are our team-oriented approach to investment decisions, rotation of coverage areas among individuals, and our culture of employee ownership. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
 
• | Culture of Ownership. We believe the key contributors to our success should have significant ownership of our business. Since our inception, we have communicated to all our employees that they have the opportunity to become members of our operating company. As of December 31, 2018, we had 43 employee members positioned within all of our functional areas. We believe this ownership model results in a shared sense of purpose with our clients and their advisers. We intend to continue fostering a culture of ownership through our equity incentive plans, which are designed to align our team’s interests with those of our stockholders and clients. We believe this culture of ownership contributes to our team orientation and connection with clients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy
 The key to our success is continued long-term investment performance.  In conjunction with this, we believe the following strategies will enable us to grow our business over time:

• | Unwavering Focus on Classic Value Investing. We view our unwavering focus on long-term classic value investment excellence to be the key driver of our business success. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capitalize on Growth Opportunities Created By Our Global Strategies. Among both institutional and retail investors industry-wide, over the past few years, there have been increasing levels of investments in portfolios including non-U.S. equities. As of December 31, 2018, the total AUM in our Global Value strategies, International Value strategies, Emerging Markets Value strategy, European Value strategy, and other Global & non-U.S. strategies was $18.9 billion, or 56.6% of our overall AUM. Our global capability provides opportunity for implementation of our strategies around the world. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Work with Our Strong Consultant Relationships. We believe that we have built strong relationships with the leading investment consulting firms who advise potential institutional clients. Historically, new accounts sourced through consultant-led searches have been a large driver of our inflows and are expected to be a major component of our future inflows. We estimate that approximately 70% of all retirement plan assets are advised by investment consultants, with a relatively small number of these consultants representing a significant majority of these relationships. As a result of a consistent servicing effort over our history, we have built strong relationships with consulting firms that we believe are the most important. New accounts sourced through consultant-led searches have been a large driver of our historical growth and are expected to be a major component of our future growth. As of December 31, 2018, our largest consultant relationship represented approximately 10.5% of our AUM. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Our Non-U.S. Client Base. In recent years, we have increased our efforts to develop our non-U.S. client base. Through our strong relationships with global consultants, we have been able to accelerate the development of our relationships with their non-U.S. branches. Over time, we aim to achieve growth of this client base through these relationships and by directly calling on the world’s largest institutional investors. We have also sought to expand our non-U.S. base through our relationships with non-U.S. mutual funds and other investment fund advisers. In addition to our headquarters in the United States, we have a business development and client service office in London as well as a representative office in Melbourne. To date, our marketing efforts have resulted in client relationships in sixteen non-U.S. countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada, and Ireland. As of December 31, 2018, we managed $10.8 billion on behalf of non-U.S. clients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide Access To Our Strategies Through a Range of Investment Vehicles and Distribution Channels. Our clients access our investment strategies through a range of investment vehicles and distribution channels, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds that we sub-advise, and certain private placement vehicles and non-U.S. funds. We also offer four SEC-registered Pzena mutual funds for which we act as investment adviser. During 2018, we launched a fifth SEC-registered Pzena mutual fund and an additional private placement vehicle for which we act as the sole investment adviser in an effort to expand the access investors have to our strategies. For more information concerning access to our strategies and our distribution approach, see “Our Client Relationships and Distribution Approach” below.

• | Employ Global Team to Serve Clients and Prospects. Our business development and client service professionals are critical to our business, as noted below under "Business Development and Client Service Teams," and are generally focused geographically covering both our institutional and intermediary distribution efforts. In addition to our headquarters in the United States and representative office in Melbourne, we have four dedicated professionals located in our London office. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility. As a global investment management organization, we are committed to adopting and implementing responsible investment principles in a manner that is consistent with our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients. We recognize the importance of considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues as part of a robust investment process. In the beginning of 2018, we became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which is a leading global responsible investment network of investment managers, service providers and asset owners. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Investment Team
 We have built an investment team that is well-suited to implement our classic value investment strategy.  The members of our investment team have a diverse set of backgrounds, including former corporate management, private equity, management consulting, accounting, and Wall Street professionals. Their diverse business backgrounds are instrumental in enabling us to make investments in companies where we would be comfortable owning the entire business for a three- to five-year period.  We look beyond temporary earnings shortfalls that result in stock price declines, which may lead others to forego investment opportunities, if we believe the long-term fundamentals of a company remain attractive.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a 24-member investment team.  Each member serves as a research analyst, and certain members of the team also have portfolio management responsibilities. There are generally three portfolio managers for each investment strategy.  These three managers have joint decision-making responsibility, and each has “veto authority” over all decisions regarding the relevant portfolio.  Research analysts have sector and company-level research responsibilities which span all of our investment strategies, including those with a non-U.S. focus.  In order to facilitate the professional development of our team, and to keep a fresh perspective on the companies in our investment portfolios, our research analysts generally rotate industry coverage every three to four years.
 We follow a collaborative, consensus-oriented approach to making investment decisions, such that all members of our investment team, irrespective of their seniority, can play a significant role in this decision-making process.  We hold weekly research review meetings attended by all portfolio managers and relevant research analysts, and that are open to other employees, at which we openly discuss and debate our findings regarding the normalized earnings power of potential portfolio companies.  In addition, we hold daily morning meetings, attended by our portfolio managers, research analysts, portfolio implementation, and client service personnel, in order to review developments in our holdings and set a trading strategy for the day. These meetings are critical for sharing relevant developments and analysis of the companies in our portfolios.  We believe that our collaborative culture is attractive to our investment professionals.
 Our Investment Strategies
 As of December 31, 2018, our approximately $33.4 billion in AUM was invested in a variety of value-oriented investment strategies, representing differing degrees of concentration, and capitalization segments of U.S. and non-U.S. markets. See "Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations — Operating Results — Assets Under Management and Flows" for additional details about our strategies.

The following table identifies our current U.S. and non-U.S. investment strategies, and the allocation of our AUM among them, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:

We follow the same investment process for each of these strategies.  Our investment strategies are distinguished by the market capitalization ranges from which we select securities for their portfolios, which we refer to as each strategy’s investment universe, as well as the regions in which we invest.  In addition, the number of holdings typically found in the portfolios of each of our investment strategies may vary depending on the degree of concentration in the portfolio, with our Focused Value strategies generally reflecting fewer holdings than our Value strategies.
 Our largest investment strategies as of December 31, 2018 are further described below.  This strategy detail is representative of our Value and Focused Value strategies, and variations thereof.
 U.S. Strategies
 Large Cap Value.  This strategy reflects a portfolio composed of approximately 30 to 80 stocks drawn generally from a universe of 500 of the largest U.S. listed companies, based on market capitalization.
 Mid Cap Value.  This strategy reflects a portfolio composed of approximately 30 to 80 stocks drawn generally from a universe of U.S. listed companies ranked from the 201st to 1,200th largest, based on market capitalization.
 Value.  This strategy reflects a portfolio composed of a portfolio of approximately 30 to 40 stocks drawn generally from a universe of 1,000 of the largest U.S. listed companies, based on market capitalization.
 Small Cap Value.  This strategy reflects a portfolio composed of approximately 40 to 50 stocks drawn generally from a universe of U.S. listed companies ranked from the 1,001st to 3,000th largest, based on market capitalization.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
European Value.  This strategy reflects a portfolio composed of approximately 40 to 50 stocks drawn generally from a universe of 750 of the largest European companies, based on market capitalization.
 We believe that our ability to retain and grow assets has been, and will continue to be, driven primarily by delivering attractive long-term investment results to our clients.  We have therefore prioritized, and will continue to prioritize, investment performance over asset accumulation.  Where we have deemed it necessary, we have, at times, closed certain products to new investors in order to preserve capacity to effectively implement our concentrated investment strategies for the benefit of existing clients.  Currently, all of our investment strategies are open to new investors.
 Our Strategy Development Approach
 Historically, a component of our growth has been the development of new strategies.  Prior to incubating a new strategy, we perform in-depth research on the potential market for the product, as well as its overall compatibility with our investment expertise.  This process involves analysis by our client team, as well as by our investment professionals.  We will only launch a new product if we believe that it can add value to a client’s investment portfolio.  Prior to marketing a new strategy, we generally incubate the product for a period of one to five years, so that we can test and refine our investment strategy and process before actively marketing the product to our clients.
Our Investment Performance
 Since we are long-term fundamental investors, we believe that our investment strategies yield the most benefits and are best evaluated, over a long-term timeframe.  For more information on our performance, see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Operating Results — Assets Under Management and Flows.”
Our Client Relationships and Distribution Approach
 We believe that strong relationships with our clients are critical to our ability to succeed and to grow our AUM.  In building these relationships, we have focused our efforts where we can efficiently access and service large pools of sophisticated clients with our team of dedicated business development and client service professionals.
 We distribute our products primarily through the efforts of our business development and client service team, who communicate directly with our clients and with the consultants who serve them, as well as through the marketing programs of our sub-investment advisory partners and intermediary distribution partners.  Since our objective is to attract long-term investors with an investment horizon in excess of three years, our business development and client service efforts focus on educating our investors and intermediary distribution partners regarding our disciplined classic value investment process and philosophy.
 Our business development and client service team is responsible for:
  
• | identifying, developing relationships with, and marketing to prospective clients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing ongoing service to existing accounts;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | responding to requests for investment management proposals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and maintaining relationships with independent consultants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and maintaining relationships with intermediary partners to grow retail distribution capabilities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressing all ongoing client needs, including periodic updates and reporting requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing direct relationships with clients sourced through consultant-led searches.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
Our business development and client service team is actively engaged with our research team to ensure our clients receive content-based information.  We introduce members of our research and portfolio management team into client portfolio reviews to ensure that our clients are exposed to the full breadth of our investment resources.  We also provide quarterly reports to our clients in order to share our investment perspectives.  We additionally meet and hold conference calls regularly with clients to share perspectives on the portfolio and the current investment environment.
Distribution Channels
 We manage assets in three principal distribution channels.  A summary of selected financial data attributable to our operations for each distribution channel is included in “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  The following table provides information regarding the composition of our total assets under management by distribution channel:

 | As of December 31, | 
----------------------------+--------------------+-----
Assets Under Management | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
 | (in billions) | 
Separately Managed Accounts | $ | 12.6 | | $ | 15.0 | | $ | 12.5
Sub-Advised Accounts | | 18.8 | | | 21.8 | | | 16.3
Pzena Funds | | 2.0 | | | 1.7 | | | 1.2 
Total | $ | 33.4 | | $ | 38.5 | | $ | 30.0

Separately Managed Accounts
 Since our inception, we have directly offered institutional investment products to public and corporate pension funds, endowments, foundations, high net worth individuals and their investment vehicles.  We continue to develop direct relationships with the largest institutional investors and consultants around the world.
 Sub-Advised Accounts
 We have established relationships with mutual fund and fund providers globally, that offer us opportunities to efficiently access market segments through sub-investment advisory roles.  The funds that we sub-advise are either multi-manager funds, in which we manage only a portion of the fund's portfolio, or funds for which we are the sole sub-adviser.
 Pzena Funds
 U.S. investors that do not meet our minimum account size for a separate account, or who otherwise prefer to invest through a mutual fund, can invest in certain of our strategies through our Pzena mutual funds.  In 2018, we launched a fifth Pzena mutual fund. We act as the investment adviser to five Pzena mutual funds that offer no-load, open-end share classes designed to meet the needs of a range of investor types.
 In addition, we offer investors outside of the U.S. the ability to invest in our strategies through Pzena Value Funds plc and its respective sub-funds, a family of Irish-based UCITS funds for which we serve as investment manager and promoter.  Pzena Value Funds plc began operations in 2005 and offers shares to non-U.S. investors.  We currently offer a sub-fund corresponding to our Emerging Markets Focused Value, Global Value, Global Focused Value, and Large Cap Value strategies.
 In the U.S., we offer access to many of our U.S., global and non-U.S. strategies through private placement vehicles and collective investment trusts.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
 
Advisory Fees
 We earn advisory fees on our separately managed and sub-advised accounts, as well as funds for which we act as the sole investment adviser.
 On our separately managed accounts, we are paid fees according to a schedule which varies by investment strategy.  The substantial majority of these accounts pay us management fees pursuant to a schedule in which the rate we earn on the AUM declines as the amount of AUM increases.
 With respect to our sub-advised accounts, as of December 31, 2018, we sub-advised nineteen SEC-registered mutual funds that each have an initial two-year term and are thereafter subject to annual renewal by each fund’s board of directors pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).  Fifteen of these nineteen sub-investment advisory agreements are beyond their initial two-year terms as of December 31, 2018.  In addition, we sub-advise twenty-nine non-U.S. funds.  Under these agreements, we are generally paid a management fee according to a schedule, pursuant to which the rate we earn on the AUM declines as the amount of AUM increases.  Certain of these funds pay us fixed-rate management fees.  Due to the substantially larger account size of certain of these accounts, the average advisory fees we earn on them, as a percentage of AUM, are lower than the advisory fees we earn on our separately managed accounts. 
 Advisory fees we earn on separately managed accounts and Pzena funds are generally based on the value of AUM at a specific date on a quarterly basis.  Certain of our separately managed accounts, sub-advised accounts, and Pzena funds are calculated based on the average of the monthly or daily market value of the account.  Advisory fees are also generally adjusted for any cash flows into or out of a portfolio, where the cash flow represents greater than 10% of the value of the portfolio.  While a specific group of accounts may use the same fee rate, the calculation methodology may differ, as described above.
 Certain of our clients pay us performance fees according to the performance of their accounts relative to certain agreed-upon benchmarks, which results in a lower base fee, but allows for us to earn higher fees if the relevant investment strategy outperforms the agreed-upon benchmark.  Some performance-based fee arrangements include high-water mark provisions, which generally provide that if a client account underperforms relative to its performance target, it must gain back such underperformance before we can collect future performance-based fees.  Fulcrum fee arrangements related to one client relationship require a reduction in the base fee, or allow for a performance fee if the relevant investment strategy underperforms or outperforms, respectively, the agreed-upon benchmark.
 Competition
 We compete in all aspects of our business with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.
 In order to grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively to maintain existing AUM and attract additional AUM.  Historically, we have competed for AUM principally on the basis of:

• | the performance of our investment strategies;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | our clients’ perceptions of our drive, focus, and alignment of our interests with theirs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the quality of the service we provide to our clients and the duration of our relationships with them;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our brand recognition and reputation within the investing community;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the range of strategies and investment vehicles we offer; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of advisory fees we charge for our investment management services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our ability to continue to compete effectively will also depend upon our ability to attract highly qualified investment professionals and retain our existing employees.

 Our operating company, Pzena Investment Management, LLC, is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC.  As a registered investment adviser, it is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the Investment Advisers Act, and the SEC’s regulations thereunder, as well as to examination by the SEC’s staff.  The Investment Advisers Act imposes substantive regulation on virtually all aspects of Pzena Investment Management, LLC's business and its relationships with its clients.  As an investment adviser, Pzena Investment Management, LLC owes fiduciary duties to its clients, which relate to conflicts of interest, client recommendations and other fundamental matters.  Applicable requirements relate to, among other things, engaging in transactions with clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, performance fees, solicitation arrangements, advertising, recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements.
 The U.S. funds for which Pzena Investment Management, LLC acts as the sub-investment adviser and five of the U.S. funds for which Pzena Investment Management, LLC acts as investment adviser, are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act.  The Investment Company Act imposes additional obligations, including detailed operational requirements for both the funds and their advisers.  Moreover, the Investment Company Act requires that an investment adviser’s contract with a registered fund may be terminated by the fund on not more than 60 days’ notice, and is subject to annual renewal by the fund’s board after an initial two-year term.
 Both the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act regulate the “assignment” of advisory contracts by the investment adviser.  The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an investment adviser’s registration.
 Pzena Financial Services, LLC, our SEC registered broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to the SEC's Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires that at least a minimum part of a registered broker-dealer's assets be kept in
