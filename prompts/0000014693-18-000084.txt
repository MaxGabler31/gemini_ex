Item 1. Business
Overview
Brown-Forman Corporation (the “Company,” “Brown-Forman,” “we,” “us,” or “our” below) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1933, successor to a business founded in 1870 as a partnership and later incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1901. We primarily manufacture, bottle, import, export, market, and sell a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands. We employ over 4,800 people on six continents, including approximately 1,300 people in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, home of our world headquarters. We are the largest American-owned spirits and wine company with global reach. We are a “controlled company” under New York Stock Exchange rules because the Brown family owns more than 50% of our voting stock. Additionally, taking into account ownership of shares of our non-voting stock, the Brown family controls more than 50% of the economic ownership in Brown-Forman.
For a discussion of recent developments, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Executive Summary.”
Brands
Beginning in 1870 with Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky – our founding brand – and spanning the generations since, we have built a portfolio of more than 40 spirit, ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktail, and wine brands that includes some of the best-known and most-loved trademarks in our industry. The most important brand in our portfolio is Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, which is the fourth-largest spirits brand of any kind and the largest American whiskey brand in the world, according to Impact Databank’s “Top 100 Premium Spirits Brands Worldwide” list. Among the top five premium spirits brands on the list, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey was the only one to grow volume in each of the past five years. In its fifth year on the Worldwide Impact list, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey was recognized as a top 15 growth brand and remains the second-largest-selling flavored whiskey. Our other leading global brands on the Worldwide Impact list are Finlandia, which is the tenth-largest-selling vodka; Canadian Mist, which is the fourth-largest-selling Canadian whisky; and el Jimador, which is the fifth-largest-selling tequila and designated as an Impact “Hot Brand.” Additionally, Woodford Reserve was once again selected as an Impact “Hot Brand.”1

See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Fiscal 2018 Brand Highlights” for brand performance details.
Our vision in marketing is to be the best brand builders in the industry. We build our brands by investing in programs that we believe create enduring connections with our consumers. These programs cover a wide spectrum of activities, including media (TV, radio, print, outdoor, and, increasingly, digital and social), consumer and trade promotions, sponsorships, and homeplace programs at our distilleries and our winery. We expect to grow our sales and profits by consistently delivering creative, responsible marketing programs that drive brand recognition, brand trial, brand loyalty, and, ultimately, consumer demand around the world.
Markets
We sell our products in over 170 countries around the world. The United States, our most important market, accounted for 47% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. Our largest international markets include the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Germany, France, Poland, Russia, Brazil, and Canada. In fiscal 2018, we generated 53% of our net sales outside the United States compared to 56% in fiscal 2014. The United States proportion of net sales grew from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2016 then stayed constant in fiscal 2017, mainly due to the negative effect of foreign exchange on our international business. We present the percentage of total net sales by geographic area for our most recent five fiscal years below:

Percentage of Total Net Sales by Geographic Area
------------------------------------------------
 | Year ended April 30
2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018
United States | 44 | % | 46 | % | 48 | % | 48 | % | 47 | %
International: | | | | | 
Europe | 28 | % | 27 | % | 27 | % | 26 | % | 27 | %

For details about net sales in our largest markets, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2018 Market Highlights.” For details about our reportable segment and for additional geographic information about net sales and long-lived assets, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For details on risks related to our global operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Distribution Network and Customers
Our distribution network, which we sometimes refer to as our “route-to-consumer” (RTC), takes a variety of forms, depending on (a) a market’s laws and regulatory framework for trade in beverage alcohol, (b) our assessment of a market’s long-term attractiveness and competitive dynamics, (c) the relative profitability of distribution options available to us, (d) the structure of the retail and wholesale trade in a market, and (e) our portfolio’s development stage in a market. As these factors change, we evaluate our RTC strategy and, from time to time, adapt our model.
In the United States, which generally prohibits spirits and wine manufacturers from selling their products directly to consumers, we sell our brands either to distributors or (in states that directly control alcohol sales) to state governments that then sell to retail customers and consumers. 
Outside the United States, we use a variety of RTC models, which can be grouped into three categories: owned distribution, partner, and government-controlled markets. We own and operate distribution companies in 14 markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey. In these markets, and in a large portion of the Travel Retail channel, we sell our products directly to retailers, to wholesalers, or, in Canada, to provincial governments. Over the past decade, we began distribution operations in multiple markets outside the United States, as shown in the table below.

Recent Route-to-Consumer Changes
--------------------------------
Fiscal year | Market 
2011 | Germany
 | Brazil 
2012 | Turkey 
2014 | France 
2018 | Spain 

In the United Kingdom, we partner in a cost-sharing arrangement with another supplier, Bacardi Limited, to sell a portfolio of both companies’ brands. In many other markets, including Russia, Japan, Italy, and South Africa, we rely on others to distribute our brands, generally under fixed-term distribution contracts. 
We believe that our customer relationships are good. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.
Seasonality
Holiday buying makes the fourth calendar quarter (generally, our third fiscal quarter) the peak season for our business. Approximately 31%, 30%, and 31% of our net sales for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2018, respectively, were in the fourth calendar quarter. 
Competition
Trade information indicates that we are one of the largest global suppliers of premium spirits. According to International Wine & Spirit Research (IWSR), for calendar year 2017, the ten largest global spirits companies controlled less than 20% of the total global market for spirits (on a volume basis). While we believe that the overall market environment offers considerable growth opportunities for us, our industry is now, and will remain, highly competitive. We compete against many global, regional, and local brands in a variety of categories of beverage alcohol, but our brands compete primarily in the industry’s premium-and-higher price categories. Our competitors include major global spirits and wine companies, such as Bacardi Limited, Becle S.A.B. de C.V., Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., Diageo PLC, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Pernod Ricard SA, and Rémy Cointreau. In addition, particularly in the United States, we increasingly compete with national companies and craft spirit brands, many of which are recent entrants to the industry.
Brand recognition, brand provenance, quality of product and packaging, availability, flavor profile, and price affect consumers’ choices among competing brands in our industry. Several factors influence consumers’ buying decisions, including: advertising; promotions; merchandising in bars, restaurants, and shops; expert or celebrity endorsement; social media and word of mouth; and the timing and relevance of new product introductions. Although some competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, we believe that our competitive position is strong, particularly as it relates to brand recognition, quality, availability, and relevance of new product introductions.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal raw materials used in manufacturing and packaging our distilled spirits, liqueurs, RTD products, and wines are shown in the table below. 

Principal Raw Materials
-----------------------
Distilled Spirits | Liqueurs | RTD Products | Wines | Packaging 
Agave | Flavorings | Flavorings | Grapes | Aluminum cans
Barley | Neutral spirits | Malt | Wood | Cartons 
Corn | Sugar | Neutral spirits | | Closures 
Malted barley | Water | Sugar | | Glass bottles
Rye | Whiskey | Tequila | | Labels 
Sugar | Wine | Water | | PET1 bottles 
Water | | Whiskey | | 
Wood | | | |

Currently, none of these raw materials are in short supply, but shortages could occur. From time to time, our agricultural ingredients (agave, barley, corn, grapes, malted barley, and rye) could be adversely affected by weather and other forces out of our control that might constrain supply.
Whiskeys, certain tequilas, and other distilled spirits must be aged. Because we must schedule production years in advance to meet future demand for these products, our inventories of them may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.
For details on risks related to the unavailability of raw materials and the inherent uncertainty in forecasting supply and demand, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights include trademarks, copyrights, proprietary packaging and trade dress, proprietary manufacturing technologies, know-how, and patents. Our intellectual property, especially our trademarks, is essential to our business. We register our trademarks broadly – some of them in every country where registration is possible. We register others where we sell or expect to sell our products. We protect our intellectual property rights vigorously but fairly. We have licensed some of our trademarks to third parties for use with services or on products other than alcoholic beverages, which we believe enhances the awareness and protection of our brands.
For details on risks related to the protection of our intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” For details on our most important brands, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Fiscal 2018 Brand Highlights.”
Regulatory Environment
Federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regulate how we produce, store, transport, distribute, and sell our products. Some countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of distilled spirits in whole or in part.
In the United States, at the federal level, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulates the spirits and wine industry with respect to the production, blending, bottling, labeling, sales, advertising, and transportation of beverage alcohol. Similar regulatory regimes exist at the state level and in most non-U.S. jurisdictions where we sell our products. In addition, beverage alcohol products are subject to customs duties or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the United States.
Laws of each nation define distilling and maturation requirements; for example, under U.S. federal and state regulations, bourbon and Tennessee whiskeys must be aged in new charred oak barrels; we typically age our whiskeys three to six years. Canadian whisky must be manufactured in Canada in compliance with Canadian laws. Mexican authorities regulate the production and bottling of tequilas; they mandate minimum aging periods for extra anejo (three years), anejo (one year), and reposado (two months) tequilas. Irish whiskey must be matured at least three years in a wood cask, such as oak, on the island of Ireland. Scotch whisky must be matured in oak casks for at least three years in Scotland. We comply with all of the above laws and regulations.
Our operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, and our policy is to comply with them.

Strategy
Eight years ago, we introduced our “Brown-Forman 150” long-term strategy, focused on driving sustainable growth toward our 150th anniversary in 2020. The B-F Arrow articulates our core principles: our purpose as well as the vision, values, and behaviors that we expect our employees to embrace and exhibit.
These core principles are a constant, powerful means of connecting our stakeholders to our shared vision of “Building Forever,” and we continue to refresh our strategies to reflect current realities and look beyond 2020. The strategic ambitions described below both demonstrate a sustained focus on several drivers of our recent growth and acknowledge today’s emerging opportunities.
We seek to build brands and businesses that create shareholder value – ones that deliver strong and long-term sustainable growth, solid margins, and high returns on invested capital. In addition, given our growing size and scale, we focus on building brands that can be meaningful for our company over time. Our first priority is to innovate and grow our premium spirits portfolio organically. But as opportunities arise, we will consider acquisitions and partnerships that meet our rigorous quantitative and qualitative criteria.
The Jack Daniel’s family of brands, led by Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey (JDTW), remains our most valuable asset and the engine that drives our global leadership of the American whiskey category1 and our overall financial performance. We will always work to keep JDTW strong, healthy, and relevant to consumers worldwide and to take advantage of the abundant opportunities to grow the Jack Daniel’s family of brands across markets, premium price points, channels, and consumer groups. Product innovation has become a meaningful contributor to our performance in recent years. New Jack Daniel’s expressions – Honey (2011), Fire (2015), and Rye (2017) – have led innovation in the American whiskey category.
We are the global leader in American whiskey, and see significant opportunities to continue promoting the mixability, versatility, accessibility, and premiumization of our American whiskey brands around the world. We believe that we can leverage our whiskey-making knowledge, production assets, trademarks, and brand-building skills to accomplish this objective. We will focus first on the global growth of our most important expression, JDTW, though with a heightened focus on the super-premium expressions within the trademark – namely, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Collection, and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye. In addition, we expect to continue generating excellent growth with our other whiskey brands around the world, particularly Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. We believe Woodford Reserve is the leading super-premium American whiskey globally. Old Forester is regaining its prominence in the United States and in select international markets through its unparalleled taste, quality, and the success of its high-end expressions, such as the Old Forester Whiskey Row Series and Old Forester Statesman.
In 2017, we unveiled our Slane Irish Whiskey brand in Ireland, select Travel Retail locations, and in select markets across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The distillery and homeplace were completed this past year, and we are very encouraged by the brand’s early performance and the accolades the brand, whiskey, and package have received.

Through our acquisition of The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited in June 2016, we added three world-class single malt Scotch whisky brands in The GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh. Following the integration of the acquired business, we have continued to evolve the portfolio and geographic strategy to ensure our single malt portfolio is positioned to become a meaningful contributor and a significant competitor in the fast growing single malt category over the longer term. Here again, we are very encouraged by the trade and consumer reception to the brands and the whisky.
Fiscal 2017 marked the ten-year anniversary of our acquisition of Casa Herradura, a portfolio led by two brands steeped in Mexican heritage – Herradura and el Jimador. We remain pleased with the development of our tequila business in both Mexico and the United States, the brands’ two primary markets. We plan to continue expanding Herradura tequila to reach new consumers in Mexico, the United States, and other high-potential markets. In addition to the success of the brand’s core expressions, Herradura Ultra – an ultra-premium cristalino – continues to accelerate and surpassed 70,000 nine-liter cases in fiscal 2018. After repositioning el Jimador tequila as a more premium brand in Mexico, we remain encouraged by our prospects for long-term, profitable growth there. Outside Mexico, we have nearly quadrupled el Jimador’s volumes since fiscal 2008. We remain confident in el Jimador’s potential to improve its position among the world’s leading tequila brands as the category continues to develop rapidly in the United States and to expand (though more gradually) internationally.
Finlandia, the tenth-largest-selling vodka in the world,1 is also prominent in several of the world’s largest vodka markets, such as Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Czechia. We plan to grow Finlandia where its position is strong, including in its largest market, Poland, where Finlandia accounts for one out of every two bottles of imported vodka sold.2
The United States remains our largest market, and continuing to grow there is important to our long-term success. We expect to foster this growth by emphasizing fast-growing spirits categories such as super-premium whiskeys and tequilas, continued product and packaging innovation, and brand building within growing consumer segments (with increasing emphasis on multicultural marketing).
Over the last two decades, our business outside the United States has generally grown faster than our business within it. Fiscal 2018 saw a return to this trend after a few years of suppressed international growth driven by the negative effect of foreign exchange. Our ability to achieve our long-term growth objectives requires further development of our business globally, especially in emerging markets. We expect to continue to grow our business in developed markets such as France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. We will continue to pursue RTC strategies that will expand our access to and understanding of consumers, with the most recent example being the establishment of our owned distribution organization in Spain, the world’s tenth largest whiskey market,2 during the summer of 2017. In addition, we expect increasingly significant contributions to our growth from emerging markets including Mexico, Poland, Turkey, Brazil, China, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
We believe that having a long-term-focused, committed, engaged shareholder base, anchored by the Brown family, gives us an important strategic advantage, particularly in a business with aged products and multi-generational brands. For nearly 150 years, the Company and the Brown family have been committed to preserving Brown-Forman as a thriving, family-controlled, independent company.
Recognizing the strong cash-generating capacity and the capital efficiency of our business, we will continue to pursue what we believe to be well-balanced capital deployment strategies aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman’s strength and independence.
Corporate Responsibility
In pursuing the objectives described above, we will strive to be responsible in everything we do. Our history of responsibility began in 1870, when our founder, George Garvin Brown, first sold whiskey in glass bottles to ensure quality and safety – an innovation some might consider the first act of corporate responsibility in the industry. Today, achieving our stated business purpose, to “enrich the experience of life,” is possible only within a context of corporate responsibility. This means putting our values in action by promoting responsible consumption of alcohol; providing a healthy, safe, inclusive, and engaging workplace; protecting the environment; and making a positive contribution to our communities.
Values-Driven Organization. The foundation of our culture is our core values: Integrity, Trust, Respect, Teamwork, and Excellence. Our employee engagement survey responses demonstrate that we not only state these words as our values, but we live them, too. Our values are reflected in our Code of Business Conduct that employees acknowledge and pledge to comply with. Additionally, in the spirit of teamwork, we use our values as one set of criteria when evaluating business partners.

Alcohol Responsibility. Our business is based on the belief that beverage alcohol, consumed in moderation, can enrich the experience of life. However, we are well aware that, when consumed irresponsibly, alcohol can have harmful effects on individuals and society. We appreciate the need for governments to regulate our industry appropriately and effectively, taking into account national circumstances and local cultures. We also appreciate that some people should not drink or choose not to drink, and we respect this choice. Acting in partnership with others, we want to be part of the solution to real, complex problems such as underage drinking, drunk driving, overconsumption, and alcoholism.
As a significant player in the global beverage alcohol industry, we foster collective action with our peers. Working with other producers, we are able to leverage our views on a scale that can create change. In 2017, we concluded our five-year program with 10 other industry leaders that signed the Beer, Wine, and Spirits Producers’ Commitments to Reduce Harmful Drinking. Our collective progress on these commitments will be reported later in 2018 and can be seen at www.producerscommitments.org.
Since 2009, we have hosted an open forum to share our points of view, post the research of outside experts, and encourage the opinions of others at www.OurThinkingAboutDrinking.com. In the past year, we have added information from contributors on a variety of alcohol-related subjects, including addiction and pregnancy, moderate consumption, and alcohol and aggression.
In 2017, Korbel partnered with the Dryver designated driver service to provide more than 2,000 free designated drivers in 77 cities nationwide. In Poland we partnered with Carrefour, a large retailer chain, to deliver key responsibility messages to consumers across 90 of their stores. For the fourth consecutive year, the New Hampshire (NH) Liquor Commission and Jack Daniel’s teamed up for the award-winning Live Free & Host Responsibly campaign. Since its launch in 2015, the campaign has reached thousands of NH Liquor & Wine Outlet customers, promoting responsible service and consumption of alcohol. This first-of-its-kind collaboration between a control state and a beverage alcohol company has become a model for the industry, gaining widespread attention and industry praise. We also continued to collaborate with the Responsible Retailing Forum, which brings together diverse stakeholders seeking to reduce underage sales, among other initiatives. In our consumer relationships, we seek to communicate through responsible advertising content and placement, relying on our comprehensive internal marketing code and adhering to industry marketing and advertising guidelines. We also engage with our customers through our trade associations. For example, we worked with Avec Modération in France to engage convenience stores on underage drinking prevention.
As part of our commitment to responsible marketing, and to enable consumers to make more informed decisions, in February 2017 we launched a website, nutrition.brown-forman.com, providing nutritional information on our brands. Since then, we have added three additional markets and languages to the site, with plans to add four more in the coming year.
We are founding members of, and contribute significant resources to, the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility (responsibility.org), an organization created by spirits producers to prevent drunk driving and underage drinking and to promote responsible decision making. While this is a U.S. organization, we participate actively in similar organizations in other markets, such as DrinkWise in Australia, BSI in Germany, The Portman Group in the United Kingdom, and FISAC in Mexico. We also provide long-running support for alcohol education programs at the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky (two major universities in the state of our corporate headquarters). In addition, through our corporate charitable contributions, we support organizations that offer treatment and recovery for those struggling with alcoholism and addiction. Our three anchor partners in Louisville, Kentucky, are The Healing Place, The Morton Center, and Volunteers of America Mid-States. In addition to our financial contributions, we support these organizations by having Brown-Forman employees serve on their boards of directors.
Environmental Sustainability. We view environmental sustainability as integral to our strategy to perpetuate Brown-Forman and “Build Forever.” Our environmental sustainability strategy aims to protect and conserve the resources we depend on. It also reinforces our business strategy through programs that reduce costs through efficiency, lessen risks to our operations, and improve effectiveness through innovation. We invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and efficient transportation to reduce our carbon footprint. In 2018, we executed a 15-year power purchase agreement for environmental attributes associated with the energy output from a wind farm facility located in Kansas. The wind farm is expected to generate the equivalent of more than 90% of Brown-Forman’s annual electricity use in the United States. 
Mindful of our overall impact, in fiscal 2014, we set ambitious environmental sustainability goals for fiscal 2023: reducing our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 15% and reducing our water use and wastewater discharges per unit of product by 30% (compared to metrics in 2012). In addition, we set a goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2020. These goals support our ambition to grow our brands and our company responsibly while protecting and enriching the natural environment. We have refreshed our strategy to include a greater focus beyond our operational borders into our supply chain. We report on our progress toward these goals in our biennial Corporate Responsibility Reports, available on our corporate website. 
Diversity, Inclusion, and Human Rights. We believe that having a diverse and inclusive workforce is central to our success. As we work to increase our brands’ relevance and appeal to diverse consumer groups, we need a diversity of experiences and outlooks within our own workforce. We also want employees to feel comfortable in contributing their whole selves and different perspectives to their work. Over the past few years, we have made progress with diverse representation at the senior level. Four 
9

women and one African American serve on our Board of Directors. Three members of our 13-member Executive Leadership Team are women and two are minorities. In 2018, we once again earned a perfect score of 100% in the Corporate Equality Index, a national benchmarking survey and report on corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ workplace equality administered by the Human Rights Campaign. This makes us one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ equality”1 in the United States for
the eighth consecutive year. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have been the core of our diversity culture by supporting employees’ growth while enhancing their contributions. Our eight ERGs foster a diverse, inclusive environment that drives our high-commitment, high-performance organization and encourages our employees to bring their individuality to work. Our commitment to diversity extends to our partnerships with small and diverse suppliers. By 2020, our goal is to source at least 16% of our procurement from businesses owned by ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ persons, people with disabilities, and veterans. To date, we have procured approximately 11% of our supplies from such businesses.
In the marketplace, we focus on promoting fair, ethical business practices. We remain committed to the guidelines set forth in our Global Human Rights Statement, defining our commitment to respecting the fundamental rights of all human beings. Our work in this area helped inform our response to the U.K.’s passage of the Modern Slavery Act in 2015, which is available on our corporate website.
Community Involvement. Our approach to philanthropy reflects our values as a corporate citizen. Brown-Forman believes, as a responsible and caring corporate citizen, it is vital that we give back to the communities that support both our employees and our business by thoughtfully deploying our time, talent, and resources. We collaborate with a variety of mission-driven organizations focused on enhancing intellectual and cultural living, ensuring essential living standards, and empowering responsible and sustainable living. While we focus on our hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, our civic engagement activities extend to the communities around the globe where our employees work, live, and raise their families.
In fiscal 2018, we donated approximately $11 million, logged approximately 17,000 volunteer hours, and had 123 employees serve on boards of directors of 196 non-profit organizations. In addition, with the goal of helping fund our ongoing philanthropic endeavors in the communities where our employees live and work, we created the Brown-Forman Foundation with a contribution of $70 million in fiscal 2018. We anticipate that the Brown-Forman Foundation’s proceeds will provide a consistent amount of revenue per year for its charitable giving program independent of our yearly earnings.
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We reviewed our corporate responsibility strategy against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a set of 17 global goals designed to address a broad range of sustainable development issues from climate change to poverty and gender equality. Our review on where our work aligns with these goals is available in our 2017-2018 Corporate Responsibility Report (www.brown-forman.com/responsibility).
