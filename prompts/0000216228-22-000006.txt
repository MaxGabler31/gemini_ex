OTHER COMPANY INFORMATION
Key Components and Raw Materials
All of our businesses require various manufactured components and raw materials, the availability and prices of which may fluctuate.

MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS ASSEMBLED INTO OUR PRODUCTS
• Motors | • Castings 
• Mechanical Seals | • Machined Castings 
• Metal Fabrications | • Miscellaneous Metal, Plastic, and Electronic Components


PRIMARY RAW MATERIALS 
• Steel | • Gold | • Copper | • Nickel
• Iron | • Aluminum | • Tin | • Rubber
• Specialty Alloys, including Titanium | | 

Raw materials are purchased in various forms, such as sheet, bar, rod and wire stock, pellets, and metal powders. We also use various specialty resins and adhesives. Raw materials, supplies and product subassemblies are purchased from third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, and commodity dealers. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such materials are readily available. However, in some instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers.
Our operating results are generally exposed to fluctuations in the prices and supply constraints of raw materials and commodities due to inflation, supply chain disruptions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries. We continually monitor the business conditions of our supply chain to maintain our market position and to avoid potential supply disruptions. During 2021, we experienced, and continue to experience, significant disruptions to our supply chain caused primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic. These supply chain challenges have resulted in shortages of materials, including commodities such as steel, and other components that we use in our production processes. Because of the rising demand for raw materials globally, we have experienced significant increases in prices and shipping costs, which impacted our financial results. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information. We have been able to partially mitigate the impact of this inflation via fixed-price supply contracts with suppliers, price increases to customers and productivity savings. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements for an average of four to eight weeks, with the exception of some specialty materials. In limited circumstances, we may have to obtain scarce components for higher prices on the spot market, which may have a negative impact on our results. We also acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. We evaluate hedging opportunities to mitigate or minimize the risk of margin erosion resulting from the volatility of commodity prices. The challenges associated with supply chain disruptions, inflation and tariffs are expected to continue in 2022, and we are unable to reasonably predict when they will be resolved. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be adversely affected by materials price volatility or the availability of supplies to meet customer demand in the future.
Manufacturing Methods
Our businesses utilize two primary methods to fulfill demand for products: build-to-order and engineer-to-order. 
•Build-to-order consists of assembling a group of products with the same pre-defined specifications, generally for our OEM customers. We employ build-to-order capabilities to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations.
•Engineer-to-order consists of assembling a customized system according to a customer’s individual order specifications. Engineer-to-order permits the configuration of units to meet the customized requirements of our customers. 
In both cases, we offer design, integration, test, and other production value-added services. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both build-to-order and engineer-to-order seek to improve customer delivery performance and minimize inventory holding periods.
Intellectual Property
Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our products or where proprietary rights are expected to improve our competitive position. The highly customized application engineering embedded within our products, our proprietary rights, our knowledge capabilities, and our brand recognition all contribute to enhancing our competitive position.
Although we own and control a significant number of patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our Company, as a whole, as well as each of our core segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights. Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications, and license agreements has evolved over a long period of time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent or other intellectual property right to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
Research and Development
Research and Development (R&D) is key to our strategy and is generally focused on the design of highly engineered solutions. R&D focuses on developing competitive solutions to address clear needs in the market segments we serve. In addition, we work closely with our customers to address their needs by engineering solutions to fit their particular application, thus enabling our customers to achieve their specific goals. We believe R&D is a source of competitive advantage and, in recent years, we have invested in new product innovation, including opening new innovation centers in Italy and China to support our R&D efforts. We plan to continue this effort in the future. R&D as a percentage of sales was 3.4% during 2021, 2020, and 2019. 
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Many of the businesses in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. We consider our connector products in our CCT segment to be an early-cycle business, meaning it generally is impacted in the early portion of an economic cycle. Our automotive and aerospace components businesses tend to be impacted in the middle portion of the cycle, and our industrial pump business typically is impacted late in the economic cycle.
Our businesses experience limited seasonal variations. Revenue impacts from the limited seasonal variations are typically mitigated by our backlog of orders that allows us to adjust levels of production across different periods.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, water discharges and waste disposal. In the U.S., these include, but are not limited to, the Federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Environmental requirements are significant factors affecting our operations. We have established an internal program to assess compliance with applicable environmental requirements at our facilities. The program, which includes periodic audits of many of our locations, including our major operating facilities, is designed to identify problems in a timely manner, correct deficiencies and prevent future noncompliance. ITT's environmental liabilities are, for the most part, not associated with current operating facilities (only two of ITT's 26 locations with environmental liabilities are current operating sites). Additionally, ITT’s diligent approach to remediation has resulted in a reduction in the number of ongoing environmental remediation matters by approximately 50% over the past six years.
We closely monitor our environmental responsibilities, together with trends in environmental laws. In addition, we have purchased insurance protection against certain environmental risks arising from our business activities. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change, and the nature and timing of such changes, if any, is difficult to predict. As actual costs incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from our current estimates given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, management believes it is possible that the outcome of these uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. For additional information regarding environmental matters, see "Critical Accounting Estimates" within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and our September 2021 sustainability report, SustainabilITTy 2021 Supplement, which can be found on our website.
Human Capital Management
In order to continue innovating in the industries we serve, ITT remains committed to attracting and retaining top talent. We strive to make ITT a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace for all, and create a higher performance 
culture with opportunities and training for employees to develop and grow professionally and personally. In addition, we offer competitive compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,900 employees located in 35 countries, including approximately 2,600 employees in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 21% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. No one unionized facility accounted for more than 11% of ITT's total revenues. In addition, many of our global employees are covered by collective agreements or represented by works councils or other groups. We continually focus on building strong relationships with our employees, and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages in the past several years. 
Corporate Governance and Oversight
We believe the success of our business is tied to the strength of our human capital. In order to foster a higher-performance culture, we are committed to maintaining effective strategies to support recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. To facilitate oversight of these matters, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is composed of highly experienced and diverse individuals. The role of the Board is to oversee the affairs of the Company, including those pertaining to human capital, and to ensure the overall success of the business. The Board and our executive leadership team are committed to creating and adhering to policies and practices that will help attract, retain, and develop a workforce aligned with our human capital strategies, goals and values. The Board and executive leadership team also work closely together to evaluate human capital areas, such as those involving workplace health, safety, and well-being; and to implement measures to support these areas. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are key business priorities for ITT and core to our values as a company. We are committed to fostering an inclusive culture that is fueled by diverse ideas and perspectives, and to leveraging these differences in ways that positively impact our performance, the engagement of our people, and the global communities in which we operate. Along with this, we demonstrate our commitment to DEI through actions and we align our efforts to our strategic workplace and marketplace goals. This includes creating an environment where all ITTers are able to fully engage, achieve their potential, and freely share ideas to guide us toward innovative thinking and better business decisions and solutions. It also includes driving practices and programs to build and support diverse representation in our employee population, including diversity with regard to race, religion, gender, disability, nationality, age, sexual orientation, ethnic background, and more. For additional information about actions at ITT to drive DEI, along with our diversity metrics and statistics, please refer to our 2019 Sustainability Report and 2020 and 2021 annual supplements. Our next sustainability report supplement, to be published in 2022, will provide additional information about the progress we are making against our DEI strategy, including the diverse representation goals we have set for the next five years. We firmly believe we will create more success by continuously learning from each other's ideas, opinions and experiences. We also believe that by creating a diverse environment, we will sustain and propel our success in the global marketplace to create long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
Health, Safety and Well-being
At ITT, the health, safety, and well-being of our employees is our number one priority. Our Environmental, Safety, Health and Security (ESH&S) team provides for the systemic control of workplace risks and drives continual improvement of environmental and occupational safety and health protocols at all our sites around the world. We challenge ourselves to continually reduce injury frequency and severity by engaging employees in our “Accept Only Zero” safety accountability system and fostering an environment where employees take responsibility for their actions and have access to tools and training to work safely together.
The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions as part of our "Ready, Safe, Go!" program to help protect our workforce. We created core crisis teams and enacted safety measures at all of our sites. These measures included enhanced cleaning protocols, temperature checks, on-site rapid testing, and distribution of personal protective equipment and testing kits. We also redesigned employee workspaces to enable social distancing and allowed non-manufacturing employees to work from home when appropriate. As a result of these measures, we have been able to operate our facilities as safely as reasonably possible under the circumstances.
Talent Development
We invest significant resources to develop our talent and to remain a worldwide leader in the manufacturing of highly engineered customized products and solutions. We foster employee growth and development by providing numerous training and experiential opportunities across the globe and by engaging in active talent reviews and in-depth succession planning sessions globally. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals and to build strong management and leadership skills. 
Compensation and Benefits
We provide flexible compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base salaries, we offer numerous benefits for certain eligible employees, including annual bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition reimbursement. With respect to stock awards, we have used discretionary equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate the retention of key personnel, particularly those identified as high-performing talent.
General Developments of the Business
There have been no acquisitions or significant business developments since our previous Form 10-K filing, with the exception of the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC (InTelCo), a former subsidiary which held our asbestos-related assets and liabilities. See Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, for further information.
