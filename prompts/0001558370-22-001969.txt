Item 1. Business.
Our Business
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and cytokine therapeutics to treat patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases who have unmet medical needs. We are advancing a broad portfolio of clinical-stage XmAb® drug candidates from our proprietary protein engineering technology platforms. We also use our protein engineering capabilities to increase our understanding of protein structure and interactions and to design new technologies and XmAb development candidates with improved properties. In addition to engineering protein-target interactions, our approach to protein design includes engineering Fc domains, the part of an antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. The Fc domain is constant and interchangeable among antibodies, and our engineered XmAb Fc domains can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains. 
Our protein engineering capabilities and Fc technologies enable us and our partners to develop XmAb antibodies and biotherapeutic drug candidates with improved properties and functionality, which can provide innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantage over other treatment options. For example, we have developed an antibody scaffold to rapidly create novel bispecific antibodies that bind two different targets simultaneously, creating entirely new biological mechanisms. Other applications of our protein engineering technologies enhance antibody performance by increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half-life and stabilizing novel protein structures, such as engineered cytokines. Three marketed XmAb medicines have been developed with our protein engineering technologies and are generating royalties for us.
Our protein engineering capabilities allow us to continually explore new functionality in the Fc region, which provides us with opportunities to:

● | Create new technology platforms;
--+---------------------------------


● | Make new drug candidates for internal development or partnering opportunities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide collaboration and licensing opportunities with partners for application of our technologies, access to our technologies, access to our drug candidates, or combinations of each.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing engineered biologic medicines to treat patients with severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

1. | Advance the clinical development of our XmAb bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates. Our modular bispecific technology and protein engineering capabilities enable us to rapidly advance multiple drug candidates into clinical development. We and our partners are enrolling patients in multiple mid-stage and early-stage clinical studies to evaluate our XmAb bispecific antibody drug candidates and engineered cytokine drug candidates. We and our partners plan to advance additional bispecific antibodies and cytokines into clinical development in the future.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Build and manage a large and diversified portfolio of XmAb drug candidates. We create new XmAb bispecific antibody and cytokine product candidates to exploit the novel mechanisms of action enabled by our protein engineering technology platforms, and we advance them into our portfolio of preclinical and clinical-stage assets. We regularly evaluate our portfolio of candidates and make additional investments in those candidates that present promising early clinical and scientific data, partner certain drug candidates to third-party biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and will stop development of candidates based on the evaluation of emerging clinical and scientific data and the competitive environment for such programs.

3. | Leverage our protein engineering capabilities, XmAb Fc domains, and XmAb drug candidates with partnerships, collaborations, and licenses to generate revenue streams, create new drug candidates and combination treatments, and identify new indications for our pipeline of drug candidates.Generate revenue streams. The plug-and-play nature of our Fc technologies and our ability to generate multiple drug candidates efficiently provides us opportunities to generate revenue from licensing and collaboration arrangements. In 2021, we received total proceeds of $204.9 million in upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties from such arrangements.Create new XmAb drug candidates and investigate novel combination therapies. We seek to leverage our XmAb Fc domains and protein engineering capabilities with partners to create novel XmAb drug candidates, and to evaluate our XmAb drug candidates in combination with other therapeutic agents, when applicable. Identify new indications for our pipeline of drug candidates. We continue to support Investigator Sponsored Trials (ISTs) in which investigators may explore additional therapeutic indications with XmAb drug candidates.

4. | Broaden the functionality of our XmAb Fc technology platforms. We are conducting further research into the function and application of antibody Fc domains in order to expand the scope of our XmAb Fc technology platforms. We use the modularity of our XmAb bispecific Fc domains to engineer bispecific antibodies and cytokines in a variety of structural formats. For example, CD3 bispecific antibodies of a mixed valency format, i.e., the XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody, may preferentially kill tumor cells that have higher target expression than normal cells, which may be especially beneficial in designing antibodies that target solid tumors. Additionally, we have engineered CD28 bispecific antibodies to provide conditional CD28 co-stimulation of T cells, activating them when bound to tumor cells. Targeted CD28 bispecific antibodies may provide conditional co-stimulation of T cells, for example, to T cells recognizing neoantigens or in concert with CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies.

5. | Continue to expand our patent portfolio protecting our Fc technologies and XmAb drug candidates. We seek to expand our intellectual property estate and protect our proprietary Fc technologies, our development programs, and XmAb drug candidates by filing and prosecuting patents in the United States and other countries. Where appropriate, we will seek expansion and extension of patents issued for our product candidates and for partnered product candidates that incorporate one of our Fc technologies.

XmAb Bispecific Fc Domain and New Multi-Specific Antibody Formats
Our modular approach to protein engineering is a distinguishing feature of our Fc technologies. This inherent flexibility enables us to design new XmAb bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates with distinct and novel mechanisms-of-action and to seek out new applications of the XmAb Bispecific Fc Domain. Our business, research, and clinical efforts are to develop and advance our Fc technologies and our portfolio of XmAb bispecific antibody and engineered cytokine drug candidates in oncology and autoimmune diseases.
CD3 candidates: CD3 bispecific antibody candidates are designed to redirect T cells to tumor cells through the engagement of an antigen on tumor cells and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. We are currently advancing two CD3 bispecific antibody candidates in Phase 2 clinical development: plamotamab and tidutamab.
We have significantly expanded the potential of our CD3 bispecific antibodies with the multi-specific XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody format, utilizing two identical tumor targeting domains and one CD3 targeting domain. The affinities for antigen binding are engineered to enable selective engagement and killing of high antigen-expressing tumor cells over low antigen-expressing normal cells. In preclinical models, XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibodies bound preferentially to tumor cells compared to normal cells and effectively recruited T cells to kill tumor cells selectively. We

believe that these properties will be particularly important when developing bispecific antibodies against many solid tumor targets, where standard monovalent targeting of tumor antigens could lead to poor tolerability because such targets are often expressed on a range of normal tissues, including critical organs. We are currently initiating a Phase 1 study for XmAb819, an ENPP3 x CD3 bispecific antibody, which is engineered with the XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody format. 
CD28 candidates: T cells in the tumor microenvironment require both T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory receptor engagement to achieve full activation. CD28 is a key immune co-stimulatory receptor on T cells; however, the ligands that activate T cells through CD28 are often not expressed on tumor cells. Targeted CD28 bispecific antibodies may provide conditional co-stimulation of T cells, for example, to T cells recognizing neoantigens or in concert with CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies. We have engineered XmAb bispecific antibodies to provide selective CD28 co-stimulation of T cells, activating them when bound to tumor cells, and we are conducting preclinical studies of internal CD28 candidates. Under our two collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), we are applying our bispecific technologies to create and characterize CD28 bispecific antibody candidates against a prostate tumor target, and against multiple B cell targets.
TME activator candidates: Our tumor microenvironment (TME) activators have been designed to promote tumor-selective T-cell activation by targeting multiple checkpoints or co-stimulating receptors. These candidates also incorporate our Xtend™ technology for longer half-life. We are currently advancing vudalimab in Phase 2 clinical development and are conducting Phase 1 studies for two additional TME activator candidates: XmAb841 and XmAb104.
Cytokine candidates: We have also expanded the use of our XmAb bispecific Fc domain to engineer novel cytokine candidates, which are not antibodies, but fusions of a heterodimeric Fc domain and immune signaling proteins. We engineer our cytokine candidates with reduced potency to improve therapeutic index and with our Xtend technology for longer half-life. Two XmAb cytokine candidates are being evaluated in Phase 1 studies: XmAb306 (RO7310729) and XmAb564.
We continue to invest in our protein engineering efforts to identify novel technologies and drug candidates.
Other XmAb Fc Domains
We have also created additional XmAb Fc domains, and we have successfully entered partnerships for these technologies and for XmAb drug candidates that incorporate them. We will continue to seek additional partnering and licensing opportunities for these Fc domains. Additional XmAb Fc domains include:

1. | Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain – selective immune inhibition and rapid target clearance, targeting the receptor FcγRIIb;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Cytotoxic Fc Domain – increased cytotoxicity, targeting the receptors FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells and FcγRIIa on other immune system cells; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Xtend™ Fc Domain – extended antibody half-life, targeting the receptor FcRn on endothelial cells.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approved or Authorized Medicines Engineered with XmAb Fc Domains
Currently three medicines that have been developed with our XmAb Fc domains are now marketed or made available by our partners. These medicines generated $80.3 million in royalty revenue for us in 2021, which has partially offset our internal development costs.

● | Sotrovimab: Vir Biotechnology, Inc. and its partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc have made available sotrovimab, an antibody that targets the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk adults and pediatric patients. Sotrovimab has been granted a marketing authorization in the European Union (EU), approved via Japan’s Special Approval for Emergency Pathway in Japan, and granted conditional,

provisional, or temporary authorizations in 15 other countries. GSK supplies sotrovimab under the name Xevudy. Sotrovimab incorporates our Xtend Fc domain for longer duration of action.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwvz): Alexion’s Ultomiris is approved in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Alexion used our Xtend™ Fc Domain to enhance the half-life of Ultomiris to allow for a longer duration of action, less frequent dosing and reduced patient burden of therapy compared to the previous generation therapy, Soliris®.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix): In 2020, the FDA approved Monjuvi under accelerated approval. Monjuvi is a CD19-directed cytolytic antibody indicated in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In August 2021, the European Commission granted conditional marketing authorization for Minjuvi® (tafasitamab) in combination with lenalidomide, followed by tafasitamab monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). MorphoSys is also conducting studies of tafasitamab in additional B-cell indications. Tafasitamab was created and initially developed by us. Tafasitamab is co-marketed by Incyte and MorphoSys under the brand name Monjuvi in the U.S. and is marketed by Incyte under the brand name Minjuvi in the EU. Incyte has exclusive commercialization rights to tafasitamab outside the U.S. Monjuvi® and Minjuvi® are registered trademarks of MorphoSys AG.

XmAb Bispecific Fc Drug Candidates in Clinical Development
Currently, 9 XmAb drug candidates that have been engineered with our XmAb bispecific Fc domain are in clinical development. 

● | Five candidates are wholly owned and are being evaluated by us in Phase 2 or Phase 1 studies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Two candidates are being co-developed with partners; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Two additional candidates are being advanced by our partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

Additional candidates are advancing through the preclinical stages of development. Drug candidates with our bispecific Fc domain, both bispecific antibodies and cytokines, in clinical development include:

1. | Vudalimab (XmAb717) is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and CTLA-4, two immune checkpoint receptors, to selectively activate the tumor microenvironment, and it is being developed for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and other solid tumor types. Xencor has initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of vudalimab in patients with mCRPC, as a monotherapy or in combination depending on molecular subtype, and a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with advanced gynecologic and genitourinary malignancies, as well as clinically defined high-risk mCRPC. We presented updated data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in November 2021. 110 patients had been treated at the 10 mg/kg recommended dose level in dose-escalation (n=7) and in five dose expansion cohorts: melanoma (n=20), renal cell carcinoma (RCC, n=21), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=20), CRPC (n=21) and other cancers without approved checkpoint therapies (n=21). The safety analysis includes all 110 patients, who were a median of 65 years old and were heavily pretreated, having a median of four prior systemic therapies. 65% of patients had received at least one prior checkpoint therapy, and 25% had received at least two prior checkpoint therapies. Vudalimab was generally well-tolerated, and the most common treatment-related adverse events were immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The most common irAEs of any grade were rash (45.5%), pruritus (30.9%), transaminase increases (23.6%), diarrhea (11.8%), hypothyroidism (9.1%), infusion related reaction (8.2%) and myalgia (8.2%).
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The efficacy analysis included 78 evaluable patients receiving any amount of vudalimab, who had been followed for at least two cycles. Complete responses were observed in a patient with BRCA1+ high-grade serous ovarian cancer and in a patient with melanoma. Partial responses were observed in patients with melanoma (n=2), RCC (n=3), NSCLC (n=2) and CRPC (n=2). The objective response rate (ORR) across cohorts was 14.1% (11/78). All responses in patients with melanoma and CRPC and two responses in patients with RCC were confirmed. All responders, except those with CRPC, had received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The median duration of response, unadjusted, for all responders was 18.3 weeks. The median duration of response, unadjusted, for patients with RCC was 24.1 weeks, and two patients remained on treatment.
​Of the 12 efficacy-evaluable patients with CRPC, four had measurable disease and follow-up RECIST assessments, including the two CRPC responders. Six additional patients with CRPC, but without measurable disease, experienced a best overall response of non-CR/non-PD, as stable disease cannot be determined without measurable disease. The two CRPC responders had visceral and nodal metastases, had response durations of 41.3 and 27.0 weeks, were without progression on bone scans and had confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reductions of more than 50% from baseline. Among twelve patients with baseline and follow-up PSA assessments, including the two responders, 33% (4/12) had PSA reductions greater than 50%.
​

2. | Plamotamab is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. In October 2021, we entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with Janssen to advance plamotamab and XmAb CD28 bispecific antibody combinations for the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies, which expands our strategy to develop multiple highly active, chemotherapy-free regimens to treat patients with B-cell cancers. Janssen received worldwide exclusive development and commercial rights

to plamotamab, and we will collaborate with Janssen on further clinical development of plamotamab, with us paying 20% of costs, including those for a subcutaneous formulation study anticipated to enter clinical trials in 2022. We will continue, at our own expense, a Phase 1/2 combination study of plamotamab, tafasitamab (Monjuvi), and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and we plan to initiate the study in early 2022.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​We presented updated data from Part B and Part C of a Phase 1 dose-escalation study at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2021. Part B escalated dosing on administrations after the priming dose (doses between 80 and 360 mcg/kg). Part C established a step-up dosing regimen with higher, flat and less frequent dosing. The schedule, an intravenous, 50 mg flat dose every two weeks after step-up dosing during the first two cycles of treatment, was generally well tolerated and was determined to be the recommended Phase 2 dose.
​
The safety population included 50 patients in Part B (38 DLBCL, 12 FL) and 14 patients in Part C (8 DLBCL, 4 FL, 1 marginal zone lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymphoma). Patients were heavily pretreated. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) across all patients were anemia (21%), neutropenia (19%), hypophosphatemia (11%), thrombocytopenia (11%) and lymphopenia (10%). Four patients (5%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), each instance on the first dose, and no patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 CRS in Part C of the study. The rate of CRS of any grade fell from 74% in Part B to 57% in Part C. CRS was generally manageable with premedication. The efficacy analysis included 47 evaluable patients with either DLBCL or FL who were treated in Part B (n=38) or in Part C (n=9). The ORR was 51% (24/47), and complete responses were observed in 12 patients (26%). The median duration of response was 225 days for DLBCL and 171 days for FL, with six patients continuing to respond to plamotamab monotherapy. 
​
In Part C, patients had generally more advanced disease and poorer responses to prior therapy. Of the 14 patients in Part C, eight patients received prior CAR-T and three patients received NK cell therapy; two of these patients received both. All eight patients with DLBCL received prior CAR-T therapy. In Part C, safety events were generally mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 or 4 AEs experienced by more than 5% of patients included anemia (14%), lymphopenia (14%) and one patient each (7%) experiencing neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, decreases in neutrophil count, transaminase increases, fatigue and gamma-glutamyl transferase increases. The ORR was 100% (4/4) for FL, and CRs were observed in two patients (50%). For DLBCL, the ORR was 40% (2/5), and a CR was observed in one patient (20%). All 5 evaluable patients with DLBCL received prior CAR-T therapy, and two evaluable patients with DLBCL received prior NK cell therapy.
​
Expansion cohorts are actively recruiting patients with DLBCL and FL and are dosing using the recommended Phase 2 regimen to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of plamotamab monotherapy. We plan to present data from these cohorts in the second half of 2022. 
​

3. | Tidutamab is a bispecific antibody that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, a target on many neuroendocrine-like tumor types, and CD3. Dose-escalation and expansion data from the Phase 1 study in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) indicates that tidutamab was generally well tolerated at the recommended dose identified for the expansion portion of the study. Tidutamab induced sustained activation of cytotoxic T cells and engagement of the SSTR2 target and demonstrated an encouraging safety profile. We are enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical study for tidutamab in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer, which are SSTR2-expressing tumor types known to be responsive to immunotherapy.

4. | XmAb306 (RO7310729) is an IL15/IL15-receptor alpha complex fused to our bispecific Fc domain (IL15/IL15Rα-Fc). This cytokine was engineered for reduced potency, and the Fc domain incorporates our Xtend technology for extended half-life. Xencor is co-developing the program in collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Genentech is conducting a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of XmAb306 as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab. Additional studies of XmAb306 in combination with other agents are being planned.

In November 2021, we announced preliminary data from the Phase 1 study, while further dose escalation in both study arms continues. At the time, the study had enrolled six cohorts in a monotherapy arm and four cohorts in an atezolizumab combination arm. XmAb306 was generally well tolerated as both a monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related serious adverse events had been observed. Assessments of pharmacokinetics indicated that XmAb306 has a multi-day circulating half-life, which is consistent with its reduced-potency design and data generated in preclinical studies. Unconfirmed responses, as evaluated by RECIST criteria, had been observed in multiple tumor types, including in a patient treated with XmAb306 monotherapy. The study had recently reached dose levels that promote T cell activity, and evidence of peripheral effector T cell proliferation had been observed. Consistent and robust dose-dependent natural killer (NK) cell expansion and NK cell accumulation upon repeat dosing had been observed for multiple NK cell subsets, including mature NK cells. Significant NK cell expansion and accumulation was observed beginning in lower dose cohorts, and at higher dosing cohorts NK cell expansion had reached 40- to 100-fold higher levels than baseline and had been sustained for weeks throughout dosing.
​

5. | XmAb104 is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and ICOS, an immune co-stimulatory receptor, and is being developed in multiple oncology indications. We are conducting an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb104 in patients with selected solid tumors. We continue to enroll patients with select solid tumors in the dose expansion portion of the study, evaluating XmAb104 as a monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody.

​

6. | XmAb841 is a bispecific antibody that targets CTLA-4 and LAG-3, also an immune checkpoint receptor, and is being developed in multiple oncology indications. We are advancing XmAb841 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug to create a triple checkpoint blockade and conducting an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb841 in patients with selected solid tumors. We recently completed dose escalation in monotherapy and pembrolizumab combination cohorts and are enrolling in the expansion portion of the study.

​

7. | XmAb564 is a monovalent, potency-reduced interleukin-2 Fc (IL-2-Fc) fusion protein, engineered to selectively activate and expand regulatory T cells (Tregs) for the potential treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases. XmAb564 is engineered with reduced binding affinity for IL-2's beta receptor and increased binding affinity for its alpha receptor. In preclinical studies, XmAb564 was well-tolerated, promoted the selective and sustained expansion of Tregs and exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of XmAb564, administered subcutaneously in healthy adult volunteers.

​

8. | AMG 509 is a STEAP1 x CD3 2+1 bispecific antibody that our partner Amgen is advancing for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. The XmAb 2+1 multivalent format enables higher binding capability for STEAP1 expressing cells. Amgen is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study of AMG 509 in patients with mCRPC. In February 2022, Amgen presented encouraging, preliminary pharmacodynamic activity by induction of percent maximum PSA decline among 30 patients in the study, which provides an early signal of activity and validation of the potential of the XmAb 2+1 format.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

9. | XmAb819 is a first-in-class ENPP3 x CD3 XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody that we are developing for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The XmAb 2+1 multivalent format enables greater selectivity for ENPP3 expressing tumor cells compared to normal cells, which also express ENPP3 at lower levels. We are initiating a Phase 1 study evaluating XmAb819 in patients with RCC.

We combine proprietary computational methods for amino acid sequence design with laboratory generation and testing of new antibody and cytokine compositions. Our design and engineering team prospectively assesses, with patent counsel, the competitive landscape with the goal of building broad patent positions and avoiding third-party intellectual property. 
As a pioneer in Fc domain engineering, we systematically scanned the structure of the Fc domain to discover Fc variants. We have filed patent applications relating to thousands of specific Fc domain variants with experimental data on specific improvements of immune function, pharmacokinetics, structural stability, and novel structural constructs. We have filed additional patent applications derived from these applications as we discover new properties of the Fc variants and as new business opportunities arise. We continually seek to expand the intellectual property coverage of our technology and candidates and invest in discovering new Fc domain technologies, antibody product candidates, and cytokine product candidates.
Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes over 1,300 issued patents and pending patent applications which we own, with claims directed to XmAb Fc domains, all of our clinical and preclinical stage product candidates and our computational protein design methods and platforms. We also have a large number of issued patents and pending patent applications with claims directed specifically to our XmAb technology and candidates.

The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs, including biological products, of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA) created a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars via an abbreviated licensure pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. Under the ACA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is "biosimilar to" or "interchangeable with" a previously approved biological product or "reference product." The "biosimilar" application must include specific information demonstrating bio similarity based on data derived from: (1) analytical studies, (2) animal studies, and (3) a clinical study or studies that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, except that FDA may waive some of these requirements for a given application. Under this new statutory scheme, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date of first licensure. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full Biologics License Application (BLA) for such product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent proposals to repeal or modify the ACA, and it is uncertain how any of those proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions.

20



In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We seek to protect this intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of certain discoveries or inventions made by them. 
Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We have obtained registrations for the Xencor trademark, as well as certain other trademarks, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our clinical-stage products, including XmAb. We currently have registrations for Xencor and PDA in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community, and Japan, for Protein Design Automation in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Community, and for XmAb in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community and Japan.
Third Party Vendors and Suppliers
Our internal research activities are focused on early research stage and preclinical activities and studies. We rely on third party vendors, suppliers and contractors for all other research, development and clinical activities. We are able to internally manufacture the quantities of our product candidates required for relatively short preclinical animal studies. We believe that this allows us to accelerate the drug development process by not relying on third parties for all of our manufacturing needs. We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) for the manufacture of drug substance and product, including our pipeline of bispecific antibody and cytokine development candidates. We have used third party manufacturers for all our bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates which include: plamotamab, tidutamab, vudalimab, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306, XmAb564, and XmAb819. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on developing our products. We do not have any long-term manufacturing agreements in place and will ultimately depend on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products for commercial sale, as well as for process development. 
KBI Biopharma, Inc.
In July 2014, we entered into a master services agreement (KBI Agreement) with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (KBI). We have engaged KBI under the KBI Agreement for process development, clinical scale-up, analytical method development, formulation development, and other services related to drug substance and drug product for our bispecific antibody and cytokine development candidates: plamotamab, tidutamab, vudalimab, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306, and XmAb564 in accordance with cGMP regulations. For each bispecific program, we have entered into a separate agreement with the terms and conditions of services and payment. The KBI Agreement is for a three-year term but is automatically extended on an annual basis until the services are completed. The KBI Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach that is not remedied within 30 days after notice or 60 days after notice of the existence of an incurable scientific or technical issue that renders KBI unable to render services under the KBI Agreement, by after 60-day notice, or in the event of a bankruptcy of a party. For termination other than a material breach by KBI, we must pay for all services conducted prior to the termination and to wind down the activities.
Cell Line Agreements with Selexis
In December 2015, we entered into a master service agreement (Selexis Agreement) with Selexis SA (Selexis) for the manufacture of Selexis cell lines. Under the terms of the Selexis Agreement, Selexis will manufacture cell lines for the antibody candidates provided by us and upon completion of the cell lines, we have the option to take an unrestricted commercial license to the cell line. The terms of each commercial license require us to make payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and we will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales for products that are derived from or utilize the Selexis cell line. The royalty is less than 1%.

21



Selexis has manufactured cell lines for certain of our bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates, and we currently have rights to obtain commercial licenses to the Selexis cell line for the following bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates: plamotamab, tidutamab, vudalimab, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306, XmAb564, and XmAb819.
License Agreements with BIO-TECHNE 
In February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with BIO-TECHNE Corporation (BIO-TECHNE) for a non-exclusive license to certain antibody technology including monoclonal antibodies which recognize human somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2). The variable domain of this antibody is incorporated in our tidutamab drug candidate. Under the terms of this agreement, we made an upfront payment and are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the tidutamab program. The royalty is less than 1%.
We entered into a second agreement with BIO-TECHNE effective February 2018 for a non-exclusive license to a certain recombinant monoclonal antibody reactive with human programmed death protein, PD-1. We expect to use this protein in certain of our oncology drug candidates. Under the terms of this agreement, we made an upfront payment and are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones, and royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the PD-1 antibody. The royalty is 1%. 
Umbrella Development Services Agreement with Patheon Biologics LLC
In September 2018, we entered into an Umbrella Development Services Agreement (Patheon Agreement) with Patheon Biologics LLC (Patheon). Under the terms of the Patheon Agreement, any of the affiliates within the global network of service sites in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Pharma Services Group may perform clinical manufacturing and development services for us in accordance with cGMP regulations. The Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach or default that is not remedied within 30 days, or such other time period as may be reasonably necessary to remedy such breach after receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party or if the other party is subject to an insolvency event. We have the unilateral right to terminate the Patheon Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Patheon for any business reason, subject to cancellation fees. Patheon has the unilateral right to terminate the Patheon Agreement if we request to reschedule work beyond 120 days, the project work is not progressing according to our expectations and we cannot agree on appropriate changes, after six months of inactivity on a project at our request or if Patheon determines it is unable to perform its obligations in a safe and effective way in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Patheon is currently conducting process transfer, process development and cGMP manufacturing for our XmAb819 program.
Master Services Agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited
In February 2021, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (WuXi Agreement) with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (WuXi). Under the terms of the WuXi Agreement, WuXi and its affiliates will perform manufacturing, analytical, development and other services for Xencor in accordance with applicable regulations. The WuXi Agreement includes customary rights to replacement of non-conforming products. The WuXi Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach by the other party that is not remedied within 45 days (or 10 days for a non-payment breach), or if the other party is subject to an insolvency event. We have the unilateral right to terminate the WuXi Agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice to WuXi for any reason, subject to applicable cancellation fees. WuXi has the unilateral right to terminate the WuXi Agreement only if the services cannot be performed due to technical difficulties or the performance of the services is not permitted under applicable law.
WuXi is currently conducting process transfer, process development and cGMP manufacturing for our XmAb808 (B7-H3 x CD28) and our IL-12 programs.

22



Master Clinical Services Agreement with ICON Clinical Research Limited
In April 2016, we entered into a Master Clinical Services Agreement (ICON Agreement) with ICON Clinical Research Limited (ICON). Under the terms of the ICON Agreement, ICON and its affiliates will perform clinical trial services (including site selection, study design, site monitoring, management and training, and patient selection) for Xencor in accordance with applicable regulations. The ICON Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach by the other party that is not remedied within 30 days, or if the other party is subject to an insolvency event. Each party may terminate the ICON Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party for any reason, however such termination would not affect any ongoing project under the ICON Agreement. We may unilaterally terminate any project under the ICON Agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice to ICON for any reason, subject to applicable termination fees.
ICON is currently providing services to us in connection with each ongoing Xencor-sponsored clinical trial.
Competition
We compete in an industry that is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and other research organizations. We compete with these parties for promising targets for antibody-based therapeutics, new technology for optimizing antibodies and cytokines, and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities as well as greater financial, marketing and sales, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance. In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective, more effectively developed, or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize, which may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
Competition in the field of cancer drug development is intense, with hundreds of compounds in clinical trials. Many large pharmaceutical companies and other smaller biotechnology companies are developing competing bispecific antibody platforms, and many of these companies have advanced multiple drug candidates into clinical development, including Amgen Inc.; Genmab A/S; Macrogenics, Inc.; Merus N.V.; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Roche Holding AG.
We are developing bispecific antibody drug candidates engineered to direct cytotoxic T cell killing of tumor cells, by engaging the CD3 receptor on T cells and an antigen on tumor cells. Regarding plamotamab, other companies developing CD3 bispecific antibodies directed to CD20, an antigen expressed on many blood tumors, include AbbVie Inc. and Genmab A/S; IGM Biosciences, Inc.; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Roche Holding AG. Other antibodies, antibody drug candidates and cell therapies are in development or approved to treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 
We are also developing several bispecific antibody drug candidates engineered to selectively engage the immune system in order to treat patients with cancer, such as vudalimab, XmAb841 and XmAb104. Immuno-oncology is a competitive field within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and most large pharmaceutical companies are developing drug candidates, have marketed medicines in this space, or both: AstraZeneca plc; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; GlaxoSmithKline plc; Merck & Co., Inc.; Novartis AG; Pfizer Inc.; Roche Holding AG; and Sanofi S.A. While tuning the binding affinities plays a crucial role in designing the mechanism of action for this class of bispecific antibody, smaller companies advancing clinical programs that, like vudalimab, dually target the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 include Akeso, Inc. and Macrogenics, Inc. 

23



Several companies are developing engineered cytokines intended to activate specific immune cell populations in order to treat patients with cancer and/or autoimmune diseases, including Alkermes plc; Amgen Inc.; Cue Biopharma, Inc.; Cytune Pharma; Eli Lilly and Company; IGM Biosciences, Inc.; ImmunityBio, Inc.; Kadmon Holdings, Inc.; Medicenna Therapeutics Corp.; Merck & Co., Inc.; Nektar Therapeutics, Inc.; Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.; Novartis AG; Roche Holding AG; Sanofi S.A.; Sutro Biopharma, Inc.; and Xilio Therapeutics, Inc.
In addition, we are aware of a number of other companies with development-stage programs that may compete with the drug candidates we and our licensees are developing in the future. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
Regulatory Overview
Our business and operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local and foreign supranational, national, provincial, and municipal laws, regulations and trade practices. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drugs and biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. and other countries. Regulation by government authorities is a significant factor in development, manufacture, distribution and ongoing research activities. All our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, drugs and biologic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Various federal and state statutes and regulation also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, tracking, tracing and record-keeping of drugs and biologic products and their marketing. 
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), its implementing regulations, and other laws including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

1. | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




3. | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of a BLA;
---+--------------------------------------------------


5. | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection (if the FDA deems it as a requirement) of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | potential review of the BLA by an external Advisory Committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. The FDA or responsible Institutional Review Board may place a trial on hold at any time related to perceived risks to patient safety. Phases of clinical development include:

1. | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects, or in some cases, patients with the disease for which the drug candidate is intended, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population (but larger than in Phase 1) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population (such as several hundred to several thousand) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Post Approval. Clinical trials or other post-approval commitments may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. 

25



U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The standard time for the FDA to accept a BLA submission is two months.
If the FDA determines that the BLA is substantially complete, it will accept the BLA for review.
Once accepted, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and it may inspect the manufacturing facilities to assure cGMP compliance and clinical sites used during the clinical trials to assure cGMP compliance. The standard FDA review process is 10 months once a BLA is accepted for review, but it can take longer. During the review process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS prior to approval. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA will issue a complete response letter describing deficiencies in the BLA and recommend actions if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The applicant will have to address all of the deficiencies which could take substantial time to address. 
If the product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited and may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance for product manufacture, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as product reclass, warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties, or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our biologic product candidates, we may apply for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for one patent per product as compensation for patent term lost during 

26



product development and the FDA regulatory review process of that product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products generally not earlier than 12 years after the original BLA approval. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to existing brand product. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. 
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, once they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. 
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products, similar or more stringent than the U.S. laws.
Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we and our collaborators may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the European Union’s Directive 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.
If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
