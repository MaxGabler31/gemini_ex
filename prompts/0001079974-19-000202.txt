ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
FUTURELAND, CORP. (formerly known as AEGEA, Inc.) ("we", "us", the "Company") was incorporated in Colorado on November 29, 2007 under the name Forever Valuable Collectibles, Inc. We changed our name effective July 1, 2014 in connection with our July 22, 2014 acquisition of AEGEA, LLC which is in the planning stages of developing an international community and mega-resort destination in the heart of South Florida called AEGEA. Prior to the acquisition of AEGEA, LLC, we were been engaged in the business of buying and reselling commemorative professional and college sports memorabilia.
 
On March 10, 2015, an Exchange Agreement was entered (the "Agreement"), by and among certain shareholders and debt holders of the Company, representing the majority of the outstanding shares of the Company ("the AEGA Holders"), and FutureWorld, Corp. (hereafter referred to as "FWDG"), a Delaware Corporation which is the owner of the wholly owned subsidiary, FutureLand Properties, LLC, (hereafter referred to as "FLP"), a Colorado Limited Liability Corporation. Additionally, on June 1, 2015, FWDG, as sole member of FLP resolved that effective with the Exchange Agreement dated March 10, 2015, FWDG sold all rights, title and ownership of FLP to the Company, including all member units, assets, intellectual property, contracts, leases, and real property which includes 200 acres in La Vita, Colorado,

In connection with the Exchange Agreement, we issued an aggregate of 27,845,280 shares of our common stock to FWDG and or its assignee. FWDG and the AEGA Holders entered into the purchase and exchange agreement where the AEGA Holders agreed to deliver to FutureWorld their shareholdings in the Company in exchange for certain actions, including AEGEA Holders resignation as directors and officers of the Company and the simultaneous appointment of two directors as designated by FLP. In return for the AEGEA Holders shares of the Company, in combination with certain debt forgiveness totaling $100,000 by the AEGEA Holders, the AEGA Holders shall receive, an amount of shares to be equal to 4.9% (27,845,280} of the outstanding shares of the Company calculated after the reverse stock split which became effective on May 1, 2015. Such shares as held by the AEGA Holders which are surrendered in return for the new exchange shares to be issued, shall be cancelled in such exchange and returned to treasury. Such exchange shares when issued shall contain certain anti-dilutive rights whereby the AEGEA Holders shall receive additional shares for a period of one year from the date of issuance in order to retain 4.9% of the outstanding shares of the Company, issuable within ten days of the end of each fiscal quarter following such initial issuance. Pursuant to the Agreement, all assets of the Company, including all intellectual property, contractual rights, business plans, architectural works, property rights, and other valuable matters, shall be sold to the AEGA Holders, into a new private entity formed at their direction, control and benefit, in settlement for another $100,000 in debt due to AEGEA Holders by the Company and certain liabilities will be assumed by the new private entity. This transaction is expected to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization of FLP with the business of FLP being the continuing business since the member of FLP will have voting and management control of the combined entity.
 
In May 2015, we changed our name to FutureLand, Corp. and effected a 1 for 400 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share data in this annual report have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split.
 
Description of Business
 
FutureLand Properties LLC. was originally formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FutureWorld Corp. On October 6, 2014 FutureWorld entered into a Contribution Agreement with FutureLand, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In accordance with this agreement, FutureLand, in return for contribution of intellectual property, cash, and web development services by the Company, has exchanged 40,000,000 shares of its common stock representing 100% of the shares outstanding. On March, 10th, FutureLand Properties LLC did a merger agreement with Aegea Inc. (FutureLand Corp), ensuing FutureLand Properties LLC to become Aegea Inc. (FutureLand Corp) wholly owned subsidiary. The agreement resulted in the FutureLand Properties LLC’s shareholders (FutureWorld Corp) to be issued 27,845,280 shares of Aegea Inc. (FutureLand Corp). This will result in FutureLand Corp’s shares being held for investment on FutureWorld’s balance sheet.
 
FutureLand Corp. operates its presented business through its subsidiary, FutureLand Properties, is an agricultural land lease company catering to the industrial hemp, legal medical marijuana and recreational cannabis market. Future Land was started to capitalize upon the distinct separation of the cultivation grows from the dispensaries, specifically with respect to Colorado. In the State of Colorado, which has become the quintessential poster-child for what the industry may look like for the rest of America, at least temporarily, as other states determine what exact direction they will choose to go, there are residency laws that must be adhered to. For instance, in order to get a license to grow or profit from cannabis in Colorado you must be a 2 year resident. The laws are very specific; anyone who is not a 2 year resident cannot profit from the sale of the cannabis flower or infused products. Because of this mandate, Future Land Corp must be a land owner and leaser in order to effectively participate in the cannabis grow industry, which we believe is essential in order to gain a competitive advantage. We also must own the structures on the land to control the lease and our future position in the industry.
 
The business model is simple; offer growers the opportunity to grow. We have the land and then we find a growers requiring assist in funding and obtaining their license and grow facility. Next, we arrange for additional operational items needed, including but not limited to, complete build-outs provided from our associated company, HempTech Corp, in order to capture additional revenue.
 
Our current asset will comprise of 240 acres of prime property in southern Colorado and two signed lease agreements for grow facilities on its land. Our business plan is to continue attracting legal license holders to lease land and grow facilities on our 240 acres.  We have other developmental land use plans for other projects being pursued as well.

On, October 30, 2014, FLP closed on 239.96 Acres in La Vita, Colorado in Huerfano County for $60,000.  FLP entered into a lease agreement contract with a lease with Colorado Flower Company, LTD on Dec 1, 2014 allotting 37 acres for their grow facilities.  FLP was formed as a Colorado State company on October 6, 2014 by FutureWorld Corp.
 
Prior to FLP being formed, the State of Colorado amended their laws allowing cannabis grow facilities to be separated from cannabis dispensaries effectively opening up an entirely new business opportunity that FLP entered into at that time. At such time, FLP pursued the business plan to secure a cannabis or hemp grower to execute their business plan of leasing the land, the structures, the technologies and provide maintenance contracts associated with the grow. Integral to its strategy is to provide the financing for the entire grow operation so as to establish a position by which to harness a competitive advantage in striking the right kind of lease in conjunction with Colorado State laws that would allow FLP to make above average returns.  On Jan 20, 2015 FLP entered a contract with GPS, La Vita, Inc. allotting 5 acres for their immediate grow facilities.  All of these contracts, and land ownings are currently in FLP.
 
FutureLand’s Land and Operations in Grants Pass, Oregon
 
FutureLand Oregon, LLC closed on 50% ownership on 78 acres in Grants Pass, Oregon on July 7, 2016 for $125,000. Recent changes in the laws allowing outside residents to own cannabis licenses from cultivation, labs, extracts and dispensing signaled an immediate and necessary response for FL to engage. This is primary to our business model. We look to own and control the cannabis product by growing it first for the recreational market and expanding to the medical one. Currently our partners in the project are HSPendleton, LLC and Johnny Miller (Groovy Groves). The project has several phases it needs to go through. Phase 1 is clearing the land and making space to set up the grow (This is currently being completed.) Phase 2 will involve making application for the recreational license and getting the build out done for growing including greenhouse, cameras, fencing, well and power. Phase 3 will be putting the plants in the ground and growing our first harvest expected to be quarterly but we may opt for a rotation that allows harvests year-round every week. Phase 4 will be expansion as we envision starting out with only a couple thousand square feet of greenhouse growing space. We will be applying for a Tier II commercial outdoor license which allows for 40,000 square feet of flowering plants at any one time. It is canopy based and does not matter how many plants we choose to grow nor does it matter how many plants we keep in a vegetative state which is crucial to maximize future yields. We do intend to make use of greenhouses upon the property during colder months but we will not be using supplemental lighting on the flowering section. We will use supplemental lighting on the vegging areas to keep them from flowering until they are moved to the 40,000 square foot canopy. It is also possible that we may ask for a variance for even more space to grow as some other Oregon licensees have received approval for more space. FutureLand continues to spend development dollars to outfit the site.
 
FutureLand Oregon, LLC also purchased 50% ownership on another 265 acre site in Wolfs Creek, Oregon with a purchase price of $250,000 to HSPendleton, LLC. This property already has a Tier II recreational license to grow cannabis and is owned by Groovy Groves, LLC. FutureLand Oregon, LLC is contracted to purchase 50% of the Oregon Recreational Grow license from John Miller of Groovy Groves, LLC and is currently in the transfer of ownership cycle with the state of Oregon. Upon transfer FutureLand Corp will complete the sale with $100,000 of FutureLand stock at an exercise price of .01 per share to John C Miller. Groovy Groves, LLC has product on hand from the last harvest that has yet to be sold and will provide money to the company upon the sale and completion of the license transfer of ownership.
