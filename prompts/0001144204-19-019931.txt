The following flow chart illustrates our Company’s organizational structure:
 

Industry and Market Overview 
 
Death Care
 
China is the only country in the world with more than 200 million elderly people and consequently is the biggest old age market. The government estimates that the rate of population aging in cities and towns of China would reach 60% in 2020, which indicates the demands for funeral industry services is likely to increase.
 
We estimate that current China death care market size is around $10.3 billion and the average spending per death is around $1,100. The better the economy, the more spending in death care. China death care sector mainly included three subsectors: 1) manufacturing and marketing of funeral merchandise, 2) funeral services, 3) marketing and management of cemeteries.
 
Funeral merchandise is a fully opened market and is subject to fierce competition. Crematorium is mainly run by government held entity. Approximately 50% of cemeteries are for-profit businesses and 50% are non-profit businesses.

The leading death care companies in Hong Kong include Sino-Life Group Limited, Anxian Yuan China Holdings Limited, and SAGE International group limited.
 
Insurance
 
Taiwan insurance market is large, highly developed by most standards and still growing quite rapidly.
 
In recent 10 years, the number of Taiwan insurance intermediaries has increased by 2% annually, which indicates that the demand for insurance intermediaries is increasing. An insurance intermediary mainly provides customers with consulting services and went on to replace insurance companies’ salespersons who could only sell insurance products of their own company. Instead, insurance intermediaries can distribute to customers a wide variety of insurance products underwritten by different insurance companies, which could better meet customers’ needs. Insurance intermediaries have market share of 20% in Taiwan life insurance brokerage market and 19% in Taiwan property and casualty insurance brokerage market.
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the death care and insurance industry as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 
High-quality services
 
To ensure the high quality of our death care management consulting services and pre-need and at need funeral services, we have trained our staff to provide professional and personalized services. Utilizing our experience and expertise we will strive to help families and friends of the deceased get through the hardest time of their lives.
 
We are planning to approach candidates who have experience in death care industry to join our team. Once these people are formally recruited, we are going to have systematic training over our associates. We are aiming to have our associates well-trained and capable of offering professional and personalized services to our customers. We will invest considerable capital and human resources in providing comprehensive associate training.
 
Also, we educate and train our insurance salespersons regularly to ensure they provide our customers with accurate product information and high-quality services.
 
Multiple marketing channels
 
We expect to derive revenues in multiple channels, including, without limitation, telephone sales, third-party sales agents, ecommerce, and corporate strategic partnerships and alliances.
 
We are currently also approaching candidates who are specialized in marketing of death care and insurance industry and we will invest related capital and human resources in building our marketing team.
 
We expect that with our commitment to high-quality services, combined with our multiple marketing channels, Longbau will gradually grow into a well-known brand in death care industry and insurance industry in the future and eventually tap its way to mainland China and other Asian countries.
 
Our Growth Strategy 
 
In 2018, we expect to provide consulting services to some companies in the death care industry to improve their operation performance. Secondly, we plan to expand our customer base both in the death care industry and insurance industry. Lastly, we plan to sell new funeral related products. In the future, the Company expects to promote the death care services and insurance products in mainland China. Given mainland China is the biggest old age market, we intend to cooperate with large companies and provide consulting services to small companies in death care industry.

Products and Services
 
Management Consulting Services
 
Traditionally, funeral owners selling death care services overlook the quality of corporate management.

The Company’s services will be sold to independent death care service providers through in person contact, telephone calls, and through the internet.
