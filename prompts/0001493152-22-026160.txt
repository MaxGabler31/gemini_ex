Market Analysis
 
The global pandemic upended business as usual across all industries. As social distancing and working remotely took hold, companies accelerated the need for technology to support everything from onsite repairs to training employees. Under COVID- 19, the world has gone into isolation. Social distancing is currently the most effective way to slow the spread of the virus until a vaccine can be found to protect the population. As a result, anything that relies on human-to- human contact–which is to say, most aspects of our lives–must be amended to account for the dangers of the virus.
 
Digitization has stepped in to bridge the gaps left by mandated shutdowns and social distancing measures. Without digital tools and technologies, we would have no way to work, shop, go to school, and more. As such, this industry has a large potential to grow.
