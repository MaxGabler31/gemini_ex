ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL

The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (the “Bank”) received its Pennsylvania banking charter in 1889 and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. In 1986, Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (the “Corporation”) was formed and on January 2, 1987, the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The Bank and Corporation are headquartered in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, a western suburb of Philadelphia. The Corporation and its subsidiaries offer a full range of personal and business banking services, consumer and commercial loans, equipment leasing, mortgages, insurance and wealth management services, including investment management, trust and estate administration, retirement planning, custody services, and tax planning and preparation from 43 banking locations, six wealth management offices and two insurance and risk management locations in the following counties: Montgomery, Chester, Delaware, Philadelphia, and Dauphin Counties in Pennsylvania; New Castle County in Delaware; and Mercer and Camden Counties in New Jersey. The Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol BMTC.

The goal of the Corporation is to become the premier community bank and wealth management organization in the greater Philadelphia area. The Corporation’s strategy to achieve this goal includes investing in people and technology to support its growth, leveraging the strength of its brand, targeting high-potential markets for expansion, basing its sales strategy on relationships and concentrating on core product solutions. The Corporation strives to strategically broaden the scope of its product offerings, engaging in inorganic growth by selectively acquiring small to mid-sized banks, insurance brokerages, wealth management companies, and advisory and planning services firms, and hiring high-performing teams where strategically advantageous.

The Corporation operates in a highly competitive market area that includes local, national and regional banks as competitors along with savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, trust companies, registered investment advisors and mutual fund families. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are regulated by many agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Federal Reserve and the Pennsylvania and Delaware Departments of Banking.

•Domenick & Associates (“Domenick”)
The Bank’s subsidiary, BMT Insurance Advisors, Inc., completed the acquisition of Domenick, a full-service insurance agency established in 1993 and headquartered in the Old City section of Philadelphia, on May 1, 2018. The consideration paid was $1.5 million, of which $750 thousand was paid at closing, with three contingent cash payments, not to exceed $250 thousand each, to be payable on each of May 1, 2019, May 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021, subject to the attainment of certain targets during the related periods.
•Royal Bancshares of Pennsylvania, Inc.

On December 15, 2017, the RBPI Merger was completed. In accordance with the Agreement, the aggregate share consideration paid to RBPI shareholders consisted of 3,101,316 shares of the Corporation’s common stock. Shareholders of RBPI received 0.1025 shares of Corporation common stock for each share of RBPI Class A common stock and 0.1179 shares of Corporation common stock for each share of RBPI Class B common stock owned as of the Effective Date of the RBPI Merger, with cash-in-lieu of fractional shares totaling $7 thousand.

Consideration totaled $7.5 million, of which $5.8 million was paid at closing, one contingent cash payment of $575 thousand was paid during the second quarter of 2018, and two contingent cash payments, not to exceed $575 thousand each, to be payable in 2019 and 2020, subject to certain conditions. The acquisition of Hirshorn expanded the Bank’s footprint into this desirable northwest corner of Philadelphia. Immediately after acquisition, Hirshorn was merged into PCPB (now BMT Insurance Advisors).
•Robert J. McAllister Agency, Inc.

On April 1, 2015, the acquisition of Robert J. McAllister, Inc. (“RJM”), an insurance brokerage headquartered in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, was completed.

SOURCES OF THE CORPORATION’S REVENUE

Continuing Operations

See Note 30, “Segment Information,” in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. The Corporation had no discontinued operations in 2016, 2017 or 2018.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND COMPETITION

The Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, compete for deposits, loans, wealth management and insurance services in Montgomery, Chester, Delaware, Philadelphia, and Dauphin Counties in Pennsylvania, New Castle County in Delaware, and Mercer and Camden Counties in New Jersey. The Corporation has 43 banking locations, six wealth management offices and two insurance and risk management locations.

The markets in which the Corporation competes are highly competitive. The Corporation’s direct competition in attracting business is mainly from commercial banks, investment management companies, savings and loan associations, trust companies and insurance agencies. The Corporation also competes with credit unions, on-line banking enterprises, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, stock brokerage companies, investment advisory companies and other entities providing one or more of the services and products offered by the Corporation.

The Corporation is able to compete with the other firms because of its consistent level of customer service, excellent reputation, professional expertise, comprehensive product line, and its competitive rates and fees. However, there are several negative factors which can hinder the Corporation’s ability to compete with larger institutions such as its limited number of locations, smaller advertising and technology budgets, and a general inability to scale its operating platform, due to its size.

Mergers, acquisitions and organic growth through subsidiaries have contributed significantly to the growth and expansion of the Corporation. The acquisition of Lau Associates LLC in July 2008 and the formation of BMTC-DE allowed the Corporation to establish a presence in the State of Delaware, where it competes for wealth management business. The November 2012 acquisition of certain loan and deposit accounts and a branch location from First Bank of Delaware enabled the Corporation to further expand its banking segment in the greater Wilmington, Delaware area.
The Corporation’s first significant bank acquisition, the July 2010 merger with First Keystone Financial, Inc. expanded the Corporation’s footprint significantly into Delaware County, Pennsylvania. This was followed by the January 2015 merger with CBH and the December 2017 merger with RBPI. These bank mergers further expanded the Corporation’s reach well into the surrounding counties in Pennsylvania, including five branches within the City of Philadelphia, and also expanded the Bank’s footprint into southern and central New Jersey.

The acquisition of the Private Wealth Management Group of the Hershey Trust Company (“PWMG”) in May 2011 enabled the Bank’s Wealth Management Division to extend into central Pennsylvania by continuing to operate the former PWMG offices located in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The May 2012 acquisition of the Davidson Trust Company allowed the Corporation to further expand its range of services and bring deeper market penetration in our core market area.

The October 2014 acquisition of PCPB, April 2015 acquisition of RJM, the May 2017 acquisition of Hirshorn, and the May 2018 acquisition of Domenick enabled the Bank to expand its range of insurance solutions to both individuals as well as business clients. The Hirshorn transaction, in particular, established a key location in the desirable northwest corner of Philadelphia, affording the Bank greater opportunity to provide insurance and other financial solutions to both existing and potential clients.

In October 2015, KCMI was established which enabled the Corporation to compete, on a national level, for a specialized lending market that focuses on non-traditional small business borrowers with well-established businesses. In addition to KCMI, BMEF, which specializes in equipment leases for small- and mid-sized businesses, also competes on a national scale.

In May 2017, BMTIA was established. BMTIA is an SEC-registered investment adviser which serves as investment adviser to BMT Investment Funds, a Delaware statutory trust. There is an Investment Advisory Agreement between BMT Investment Advisers and BMT Investment Funds, on behalf of the BMT Multi-Cap Fund. The BMT Multi-Cap Fund is a broadly diversified mutual fund focused on equity investments which the Corporation’s wealth management division is able to offer as an investment choice to its client base.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state law. To the extent that the following information describes statutory provisions and regulations which apply to the Corporation and its subsidiaries, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to those statutory provisions and regulations:
•Bank Holding Company Regulation
The Corporation, as a bank holding company, is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Act”). The Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, performing certain servicing activities for subsidiaries and engaging in such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board may determine to be closely related to banking. The Corporation and its non-bank subsidiaries are subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board and the Corporation is required to file, with the Federal Reserve Board, an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Act and the regulations which implement the Act. The Federal Reserve Board also conducts inspections of the Corporation and each of its non-banking subsidiaries.

The Act requires each bank holding company to obtain prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire (i) direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company, including another bank holding company or a bank, unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares, or (ii) all, or substantially all, of the assets of any company.

The Act also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in, or from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board has, by regulation, determined that certain activities are so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks, so as to permit bank holding companies, such as the Corporation, and its subsidiaries formed for such purposes, to engage in such activities, subject to obtaining the Federal Reserve Board’s approval in certain cases.
Under the Act, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension or provision of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing any service to a customer on the condition that the customer provide additional credit or service to the bank, to its bank holding company or any other subsidiaries of its bank holding company or on the condition that the customer refrain from obtaining credit or service from a competitor of its bank holding company. Further, the Bank, as a subsidiary bank of a bank holding company, such as the Corporation, is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit it provides to the Corporation or any of its non-bank subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower.

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board may issue cease-and-desist orders against bank holding companies and non-bank subsidiaries to stop actions believed to present a serious threat to a subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve Board also regulates certain debt obligations and changes in control of bank holding companies.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources, including capital funds during periods of financial stress, to support each such bank. Consistent with this “source of strength” requirement for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fund fully the 
5

dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.

Federal law also grants to federal banking agencies the power to issue cease and desist orders when a depository institution or a bank holding company or an officer or director thereof is engaged in or is about to engage in unsafe and unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company, such as the Corporation, to discontinue certain of its activities or activities of its other subsidiaries, other than the Bank, or divest itself of such subsidiaries if such activities cause serious risk to the Bank and are inconsistent with the Act or other applicable federal banking laws.

•Federal Reserve Board and Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities Regulation
The Corporation’s Pennsylvania state chartered bank, The Bryn Mawr Trust Company, is regulated and supervised by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Department of Banking”) and subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. The Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board regularly examine the Bank’s reserves, loans, investments, management practices and other aspects of its operations and the Bank must furnish periodic reports to these agencies. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System.

The Bank’s operations are subject to certain requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, limitations on the interest rates that may be paid on certain types of deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services which may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. These regulations and laws are intended primarily for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and customers rather than holders of the Corporation’s stock.

The regulations of the Department of Banking restrict the amount of dividends that can be paid to the Corporation by the Bank. Payment of dividends is restricted to the amount of the Bank's net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the dividend payable by the Bank to the Corporation beginning on January 1, 2019 is limited to net income not yet earned in 2019 plus the Bank’s total retained net income for the combined two years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 of $55.1 million. The amount of dividends paid by the Bank may not exceed a level that reduces capital levels to below levels that would cause the Bank to be considered less than adequately capitalized. The payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation is the source on which the Corporation currently depends to pay dividends to its shareholders.

As a bank incorporated under and subject to Pennsylvania banking laws and insured by the FDIC, the Bank must obtain the prior approval of the Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board before establishing a new branch banking office. Depending on the type of bank or financial institution, a merger of the Bank with another institution is subject to the prior approval of one or more of the following: the Department of Banking, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and any other regulatory agencies having primary supervisory authority over any other party to the merger. An approval of a merger by the appropriate bank regulatory agency would depend upon several factors, including whether the merged institution is a federally insured state bank, a member of the Federal Reserve System, or a national bank. Additionally, any new branch expansion or merger must comply with branching restrictions provided by state law. The Pennsylvania Banking Code permits Pennsylvania banks to establish branches anywhere in the state.

On October 24, 2012, Pennsylvania enacted three new laws known as the “Banking Law Modernization Package,” all of which became effective on December 24, 2012. The intended goal of the new law, which applies to the Bank, is to modernize Pennsylvania’s banking laws and to reduce regulatory burden at the state level where possible, given the increased regulatory demands at the federal level as described below.
The law also permits banks as well as the Department of Banking to disclose formal enforcement actions initiated by the Department of Banking, clarifies that the Department of Banking has examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries as well as affiliates of regulated banks and bolsters the Department of Banking’s enforcement authority over its regulated institutions by clarifying its ability to remove directors, officers and employees from institutions for violations of laws or orders or for any unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty. Changes to existing law also allow the Department of Banking to assess civil money penalties of up to $25,000 per violation.

The new law also sets a new standard of care for bank officers and directors, applying the same standard that exists for non-banking corporations in Pennsylvania. The standard is one of performing duties in good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the institutions and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a 
6

person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. Directors may rely in good faith on information, opinions and reports provided by officers, employees, attorneys, accountants, or committees of the board, and an officer may not be held liable simply because he or she served as an officer of the institution.

•Deposit Insurance Assessments
The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk based deposit premium assessment system, under which the amount of FDIC assessments paid by an individual insured depository institution, such as the Bank, is based on the level of risk incurred in its activities.

In addition to deposit insurance assessments, banks are subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. The FDIC sets the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter. The Financing Corporation assessment for the fourth quarter of 2018 was an annualized rate of 0.14 basis points. Payments of the Financing Corporation assessment during the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $119 thousand.

• Government Monetary Policies

The monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the other regulatory agencies have had, and will probably continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of the Bank through their power to implement national monetary policy in order to, among other things, curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board may have a major effect upon the levels of the Bank’s loans, investments and deposits through the Federal Reserve Board’s open market operations in United States government securities, through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowing of depository institutions, and the reserve requirements against depository institution deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.

The earnings of the Bank and, therefore, of the Corporation are affected by domestic economic conditions, particularly those conditions in the trade area as well as the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies.

•Safety and Soundness
The Federal Reserve Board also has authority to prohibit a bank holding company from engaging in any activity or transaction deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank or Corporation, be such an unsafe or unsound practice and the regulatory agencies have indicated their view that it generally would be an unsafe and unsound practice to pay dividends except out of current operating earnings. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends in the future is presently and could be further influenced, among other things, by applicable capital guidelines discussed below or by bank regulatory and supervisory policies. The ability of the Bank to make funds available to the Corporation is also subject to restrictions imposed by federal law. The amount of other payments by the Bank to the Corporation is subject to review by regulatory authorities having appropriate authority over the Bank or Corporation and to certain legal limitations.
•Capital Adequacy
Federal and state banking laws impose on banks certain minimum requirements for capital adequacy. Federal banking agencies have issued certain “risk-based capital” guidelines, and certain “leverage” requirements on member banks such as the Bank. By policy statement, the Department of Banking also imposes those requirements on the Bank. Banking regulators have authority to require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual bank or bank holding company in view of its circumstances.

Minimum Capital Ratios: The risk-based guidelines require all banks to maintain three “risk-weighted assets” ratios. The first is a minimum ratio of total capital (“Tier I” and “Tier II” capital) to risk-weighted assets equal to 8.00%; the second is a minimum ratio of “Tier I” capital to risk-weighted assets equal to 6.00%; and the third is a minimum ratio of “Common Equity Tier I” capital to risk-weighted assets equal to 4.5%. Assets are assigned to five risk categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. In making the calculation, certain intangible assets must be deducted from the capital base. The risk-based capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
7

The risk-based capital rules also account for interest rate risk. Institutions with interest rate risk exposure above a normal level would be required to hold extra capital in proportion to that risk. A bank’s exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates is a factor that the banking agencies will consider in evaluating a bank’s capital adequacy. The rule does not codify an explicit minimum capital charge for interest rate risk. Management currently monitors and manages its assets and liabilities for interest rate risk, and believes its interest rate risk practices are prudent and are in-line with industry standards. Management is not aware of any new or proposed rules or standards relating to interest rate risk that would materially adversely affect our operations.

The “leverage” ratio rules require banks which are rated the highest in the composite areas of capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk to maintain a ratio of “Tier I” capital to “adjusted total assets” (equal to the bank’s average total assets as stated in its most recent quarterly Call Report filed with its primary federal banking regulator, minus end-of-quarter intangible assets that are deducted from Tier I capital) of not less than 4.00%.

For purposes of the capital requirements, “Tier I” or “core” capital is defined to include common stockholders’ equity and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. “Tier II” or “qualifying supplementary” capital is defined to include a bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, plus certain types of preferred stock and related surplus, certain “hybrid capital instruments” and certain term subordinated debt instruments. “Common Equity Tier I” capital is defined as the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and qualifying minority interests.

In addition to the capital requirements discussed above, banks are required to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier I capital.
The capital conservation buffer has been phased-in over a four-year period, which began on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer was 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017 and 1.875% for 2018, and effective as of January 1, 2019, the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in at 2.5%.
Institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
The capital requirement rules, which were finalized in July 2013, implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier I capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that no longer qualify as Tier I capital, some of which are being phased out over time. However, small depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Corporation) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier I or Tier II capital prior to May 19, 2010 in additional Tier I or Tier II capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.

The Basel III final framework provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of Common Equity Tier 1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of Common Equity Tier 1.
In addition, smaller banking institutions (less than $250 billion in consolidated assets) were granted an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Importantly, the opt-out excludes from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, but also accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans. The Corporation elected to opt-out, and indicated its election on the Call Report filed after January 1, 2015.
In 2018, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a variety of proposals and made statements concerning regulatory capital standards. These proposals touched on a such areas as commercial real estate exposure, credit loss allowances under generally accepted accounting principles, capital requirements for covered swap entities, among others. Public statements by key agency officials have also suggested a revisiting of capital policy and supervisory approaches on a going-forward basis. We will be assessing the impact on us of these new regulations and supervisory approaches as they are proposed and implemented.

•Prompt Corrective Action

Federal banking law mandates certain “prompt corrective actions,” which Federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a Federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations have been adopted by the Federal bank regulatory agencies setting forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized.
Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:”

(i)a new common equity Tier I capital ratio of 6.5%;
(ii)a Tier I capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%);
(iii)a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and
(iv)a Tier I leverage ratio of 5% (increased from 4%).
An undercapitalized institution is required to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain automatic restrictions including a prohibition on the payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, and in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person”. Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring, a limitation on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business, obligations to raise additional capital, restrictions on transactions with affiliates, and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors, or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” and continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership. The Bank is currently regarded as “well capitalized” for regulatory capital purposes. See Note 27, “Regulatory Capital Requirements,” in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the Bank’s and Corporation’s regulatory capital ratios.

•Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB Act”) repealed provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks and securities firms from affiliating with each other and engaging in each other’s businesses. Thus, many of the barriers prohibiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms have been eliminated.

The GLB Act amended the Glass-Steagall Act to allow new “financial holding companies” (“FHC”) to offer banking, insurance, securities and other financial products to consumers. Specifically, the GLB Act amends section 4 of the Act in order to provide for a framework for the engagement in new financial activities. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if all its subsidiary depository institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed. If these requirements are met, a bank holding company may file a certification to that effect with the Federal Reserve Board and declare that it elects to become an FHC. After the certification and declaration is filed, the FHC may engage either de novo or through an acquisition in any activity that has been determined by the Federal Reserve Board to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. Bank holding companies may engage in financial activities without prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board if those activities qualify under the new list in section 4(k) of the Act. However, notice must be given to the Federal Reserve Board, within 30 days after the FHC has commenced one or more of the financial activities. The Corporation has not elected to become an FHC at this time.

Under the GLB Act, a bank subject to various requirements is permitted to engage through “financial subsidiaries” in certain financial activities permissible for affiliates of FHC’s. However, to be able to engage in such activities a bank must continue to be “well-capitalized” and well-managed and receive at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination.

•Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending
The Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to help serve the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to low and moderate income individuals and areas. Should the Bank fail to serve adequately the communities it 
9

serves, potential penalties may include regulatory denials to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or purchase other financial institutions.

The Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
•Privacy of Consumer Financial Information
The GLB Act also contains a provision designed to protect the privacy of each consumer’s financial information in a financial institution. Pursuant to the requirements of the GLB Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has promulgated final regulations intended to better protect the privacy of a consumer’s financial information maintained in financial institutions. The regulations are designed to prevent financial institutions, such as the Bank, from disclosing a consumer’s nonpublic personal information to third parties that are not affiliated with the financial institution.

However, financial institutions can share a customer’s personal information or information about business and corporations with their affiliated companies. The regulations also provide that financial institutions can disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes but the financial institution must provide a description of its privacy policies to the consumers and give the consumers an opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure and, thus, prevent disclosure by the financial institution of the consumer’s nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties.
These privacy regulations will affect how consumer’s information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Management does not believe the privacy regulations will have a material adverse impact on its operations in the near term.

•Consumer Protection Rules – Sale of Insurance Products
In addition, as mandated by the GLB Act, the regulators have published consumer protection rules which apply to the retail sales practices, solicitation, advertising or offers of insurance products, including annuities, by depository institutions such as banks and their subsidiaries.

The rules provide that before the sale of insurance or annuity products can be completed, disclosures must be made that state (i) such insurance products are not deposits or other obligations of or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other agency of the United States, the Bank or its affiliates; and (ii) in the case of an insurance product that involves an investment risk, including an annuity, that there is an investment risk involved with the product, including a possible loss of value.

The rules also provide that the Bank may not condition an extension of credit on the consumer’s purchase of an insurance product or annuity from the Bank or its affiliates or on the consumer’s agreement not to obtain or a prohibition on the consumer obtaining an insurance product or annuity from an unaffiliated entity.

The rules also require formal acknowledgement from the consumer that such disclosures have been received. In addition, to the extent practical, the Bank must keep insurance and annuity sales activities physically separate from the areas where retail banking transactions are routinely accepted from the general public.

•Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) addresses, among other matters, increased disclosures; audit committees; certification of financial statements by the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer; evaluation by management of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting; auditor reports on our internal control over financial reporting; forfeiture of bonuses and profits made by directors and senior officers in the twelve (12) month period covered by restated financial statements; a prohibition on insider trading during Corporation stock blackout periods; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; a prohibition applicable to companies, other than federally 
10

insured financial institutions, on personal loans to their directors and officers; expedited filing of reports concerning stock transactions by a company’s directors and executive officers; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; auditor independence; and increased criminal penalties for violation of certain securities laws.

•USA PATRIOT Act of 2001
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which was enacted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, includes provisions designed to combat international money laundering and advance the U.S. government’s war against terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations which implement it contain many obligations which must be satisfied by financial institutions, including the Bank. Those regulations impose obligations on financial institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. The failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the financial institution.

•Government Policies and Future Legislation
As the enactment of the GLB Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act confirm, from time to time various laws are passed in the United States Congress as well as the Pennsylvania legislature and by various bank regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and place restrictions on, different types of banks and financial organizations. It is impossible to predict whether any potential legislation or regulations will be adopted and the impact, if any, of such adoption on the business of the Corporation or its subsidiaries, especially the Bank.

The Trump Administration has indicated its intent to bring changes to the U.S. financial services industry that we cannot now predict. Public comments by President Donald J. Trump, as well as his appointees at various federal agencies, may suggest the Administration’s intent to change policies and regulations that implement current federal law, including those implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. At this point we are unable to determine what impact the Trump Administration’s policy changes might have on the Corporation or its subsidiaries.
•Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)
The Dodd-Frank Act was passed by Congress on July 15, 2010, and was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. It is intended to promote financial stability in the U.S., reduce the risk of bailouts and protect against abusive financial services practices by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system and ending the concept of “too big to fail” institutions by giving regulators the ability to liquidate large financial institutions. It is the broadest overhaul of the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression and the overall impact on the Corporation and its subsidiaries is a general increase in costs related to compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and will affect into the immediate future the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies.

As discussed earlier, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions; the components of Tier I capital are restricted to capital instruments that are considered to be Tier I capital for insured depository institutions. In addition, the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier I capital unless (i) such securities are issued by bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million or (ii) such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets.

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to implement and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, among other things, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators.

The Dodd-Frank Act made many other changes in banking regulation. These include allowing depository institutions, for the first time, to pay interest on business checking accounts, requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, establishing regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees and establishing a number of reforms for mortgage originations. Effective October 1, 2011, the debit-card interchange fee was capped at $0.21 per 
11

transaction, plus an additional 5 basis point charge to cover fraud losses. These fees are much lower than the current market rates. The regulation only impacts banks with assets above $10 billion.

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. The FDIC was required to promulgate rules revising its assessment system so that it is based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of an insured institution instead of deposits. That rule took effect April 1, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008.

Although many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are currently effective, there remain some regulations yet to be implemented. It is therefore difficult to predict at this time what impact the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations will have on the Corporation and the Bank. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act could limit our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and adversely affect us. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements could also materially and adversely affect us.
