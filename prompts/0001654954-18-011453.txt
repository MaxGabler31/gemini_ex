 Item 1. Business.
  
  Overview
  
  When we formed our company, our focus was to (i) construct and/or purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline, diesel and natural gas (NG) fueling and service stations (initially, in the Miami, FL area); (ii) construct conversion factories to convert NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG); and (iii) construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on NG in the United States and also to build a convenience store to serve our customers in each of our locations. These operations represent historical operations of the company and do not represent the company’s current operations and business plan.
  
  On January 5, 2017, American Resources Corporation (ARC or the Company) executed a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Quest Energy Inc. (Quest Energy), a private company incorporated in the State of Indiana on May 2015 with offices at 9002 Technology Lane, Fishers, IN 46038, and due to the fulfillment of various conditions precedent to closing of the transaction, the control of the Company was transferred to the Quest Energy shareholders on February 7, 2017. This transaction resulted in Quest Energy becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ARC. Through Quest Energy, ARC was able to acquire coal mining and coal processing operations, substantially all located in eastern Kentucky.
  
  Quest Energy currently has five coal mining and processing operating subsidiaries: McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC (doing business as McCoy Elkhorn Coal Company) (McCoy Elkhorn), Knott County Coal LLC (Knott County Coal), Deane Mining LLC (Deane Mining) and Quest Processing LLC (Quest Processing) located in eastern Kentucky within the Central Appalachian coal basin, and ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (ERC) located in southwest Indiana within the Illinois coal basin. The coal deposits under control by the Company are generally comprise of metallurgical coal (used for steel making), pulverized coal injections (used in the steel making process) and high-BTU, low sulfur, low moisture bituminous coal used for a variety of uses within several industries, including industrial customers, specialty products and thermal coal used for electricity generation. Pursuant to the definitions in Paragraph (a) (4) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Industry Guide 7, our company and its business activities are deemed to be in the exploration stage until mineral reserves are defined on our properties.
  
  Historical pricing for the two types of coal produced are as follows:

  McCoy Elkhorn Coal LLC
  
  Located primarily within Pike County, Kentucky, McCoy Elkhorn is currently comprised of two active mines (Mine #15 and the Carnegie Mine), two coal preparation facilities (Bevins #1 and Bevins #2), and other mines in various stages of development or reclamation. McCoy Elkhorn sells its coal to a variety of customers, both domestically and internationally, primarily to the steel making industry as a high-vol “B” coal or blended coal, and high-grade thermal coal to utilities.
  
  Mine #15 is an underground mine in the Millard (also known as Glamorgan) coal seam and located near Meta, Kentucky. Mine #15 is mined via room-and-pillar mining methods using continuous miners, and the coal is belted directly from the stockpile to McCoy Elkhorn’s coal preparation facility. Mine #15 is currently a “company run” mine, whereby the Company manages the workforce at the mine. The coal from Mine #15 is stockpiled at the mine site and belted directly to the Company’s nearby coal preparation facilities. Production at Mine #15 re-commenced under Quest Energy’s ownership in September 2016. Mine #15 has the estimated capacity to produce up to approximately 40,000 tons per month of coal. The Company acquired Mine #15 as an idled mine, and since acquisition, the primary work completed at Mine #15 by the Company includes changing working sections within the underground mine, air ventilation enhancements primarily through brattice work and the use of overcasts and installing underground mining infrastructure as the mine advances due to coal extraction. In 2017, Mine #15 produced approximately 247,234 tons and sold the coal at an average price of $65.88 per ton. In 2016, Mine #15 started production and produced approximately 62,941 tons and sold the coal at an average price of $82.45 per ton. During 2017 and 2016, 100% and 100%, respectively, of the coal extracted from Mine #15 was high-vol “B” metallurgical coal quality, of which 71% and 100%, respectively, was sold into the metallurgical market, with the balance sold in the thermal market.
  
 
  The Carnegie Mine is an underground mine in the Alma and Upper Alma coal seams and located near Kimper, Kentucky. In 2011, coal production from the Carnegie Mine in the Alma coal seam commenced and then subsequently the mine was idled. Production at the Carnegie Mine was reinitiated in early 2017 under Quest Energy’s ownership and is currently being mined via room-and-pillar mining methods utilizing a continuous miner. The coal is stockpiled on-site and trucked approximately 7 miles to McCoy Elkhorn’s preparation facilities. The Carnegie Mine is currently operated as a modified contractor mine, whereby McCoy Elkhorn provides the mining infrastructure and equipment for the operations and pays the contractor a fixed per-ton fee for managing the workforce, procuring the supplies, and maintaining the equipment and infrastructure in proper working order. The Carnegie Mine has the estimated capacity to produce up to approximately 10,000 tons per month of coal. The Company acquired the Carnegie Mine as an idled mine, and since acquisition, the primary work completed at the Carnegie Mine by the Company includes mine rehabilitation work in preparation for production, changing working sections within the underground mine, air ventilation enhancements primarily through brattice work, and installing underground mining infrastructure as the mine advances due to coal extraction. In 2017, the first year of the mine’s production, the Carnegie 1 Mine produced approximately 11,974 tons and sold the coal at an average price of $65.88. During 2017, 100% of the coal extracted from the Carnegie Mine was high-vol “B” metallurgical coal quality, of which 51% was sold into the metallurgical market, with the balance sold in the thermal market.

 Quest Processing LLC
  
  Quest Energy’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Quest Processing, manages the assets, operations, and personnel of the certain coal processing and transportation facilities of Quest Energy’s various other subsidiaries, namely the Supreme Energy Preparation Facility (of Knott County Coal LLC), the Raven Preparation Facility (of Knott County Coal LLC), and Mill Creek Preparation Facility (of Deane Mining LLC). Quest Processing LLC was the recipient of a New Markets Tax Credit loan that allowed for the payment of certain expenses of these preparation facilities. As part of that financing transaction, Quest Energy loaned ERC Mining LLC, an entity owned by members of Quest Energy, Inc.’s management, $4,120,000 to facilitate the New Markets Tax Credit loan, of which is all outstanding as of December 31, 2017. ERC Mining LLC is considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated into Quest Energy’s financial statements.
 ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (the Gold Star Mine)
  
  Quest Energy, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ERC Mining Indiana Corporation (ERC), has a management agreement with an unrelated entity, LC Energy Operations LLC to manage an underground coal mine, clean coal processing facility and rail loadout located in Greene County, Indiana (referred to as the “Gold Star Mine”) for a monthly cash and per-ton fee. As part of that management agreement, ERC manages the operations of the Gold Star Mine, is the holder of the mining permit, provides the reclamation bonding, is the owner of some of the equipment located at the Gold Star Mine, and provides the employment for the personnel located at the Gold Star Mine. LC Energy Operations LLC owns the remaining equipment and infrastructure, is the lessee of the mineral (and the owner of some of the mineral and surface), and provides funding for the operations. Currently the coal mining operations at the Gold Star Mine are idled.
  
  In addition to the current owned permits and controlled coal deposits, ARC may, from time to time, and frequently, acquire additional coal mining permits or coal deposits, or dispose of coal mining permits or coal deposits currently held by ARC, as management of the Company deems appropriate.
  
  Mineral and Surface Leases
  
  Coal mining and processing involves the extraction of coal (mineral) and the use of surface property incidental to such extraction and processing. All of the mineral and surface related to the Company’s coal mining operations is leased from various mineral and surface owners (the “Leases”). The Company’s operating subsidiaries, collectively, are parties to approximately 200 various Leases and other agreements required for the Company’s coal mining and processing operations. The Leases are with a variety of Lessors, from individuals to professional land management firms such as the Elk Horn Coal Company LLC and Alma Land Company. In some instances, the Company has leases with Land Resources & Royalties LLC (LRR), a professional leasing firm that is an entity wholly owned by Quest MGMT LLC, an entity owned by members of Quest Energy Inc.’s management. LRR is considered a variable interest entity and is consolidated into Quest Energy’s financial statements.
 Coal Sales
  
  ARC sells its coal to domestic and international customers, some which blend ARC’s coal at east coast ports with other qualities of coal for export. Coal sales currently come from the Company’s McCoy Elkhorn’s Mine #15, McCoy Elkhorn’s Carnegie Mine, and Deane Mining’s Access Energy Mine. The Company may, at times, purchase coal from other regional producers to sell on its contracts.
  
  Coal sales at the Company is primarily outsource to third party intermediaries who act on the Company’s behalf to source potential coal sales and contracts. The third-party intermediaries have no ability to bind the Company to any contracts, and all coal sales are approved by management of the Company.
  
  As of December 31, 2017, Company sales to two customers accounted for 63% of those sales. Through our network of intermediaries, coal consolidators and end users, interested potential customers outpace our ability to fulfill potential orders. The Company’s desire is to expand the customer base and those who have purchased our product.
  
  On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed proclamations imposing a 25% tariff on imports of steel mill products and a 10% tariff on imports of wrought and unwrought aluminum. It is too early to know the impact these tariffs will have on demand for our metallurgical coal. Our export customers include foreign steel producers who may be affected by the tariffs to the extent their production is imported into the U.S. Conversely, demand for metallurgical coal from our domestic customers may increase. Retaliatory threats by foreign nations to these tariffs may limit international trade and adversely impact global economic conditions.

 Competition
  
  The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which the Company competes are coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and reliability of supply. Our principal domestic competitors will include Alpha Natural Resources, Ramaco Resources, Blackhawk Mining, Coronado Coal, Arch Coal, Contura Energy, Warrior Met Coal, Alliance Resource Partners, and ERP Compliance Fuels. Many of these coal producers may have greater financial resources and larger coal deposit bases than we do. We also compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries, such as Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa.
 Legal Proceedings
  
  From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to, and our property is not subject to, any material legal proceedings.
 Environmental, Governmental, and Other Regulatory Matters
  
  Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to matters such as permitting and licensing, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, remediation of contaminants, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions. In addition, we may become subject to additional costs for benefits for current and retired coal miners. These environmental laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) with respect to coal mining activities and ancillary activities; the Clean Air Act (CAA) with respect to air emissions; the Clean Water Act (CWA) with respect to water discharges and the permitting of key operational infrastructure such as impoundments; Resource Conservation and Recovery RCRA with respect to solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, as well as the regulation of underground storage tanks; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) with respect to releases, threatened releases and remediation of hazardous substances; the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) with respect to threatened and endangered species; and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) with respect to the evaluation of environmental impacts related to any federally issued permit or license. Many of these federal laws have state and local counterparts which also impose requirements and potential liability on our operations.
  
  Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities. They may also depress demand for our products by imposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly evolving and are becoming increasingly complex and stringent over time. These laws and regulations, particularly new legislative or administrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs. Individually and collectively, these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operations directly and/or indirectly, through our customers’ inability to use our products.
  
  Certain implementing regulations for these environmental laws are undergoing revision or have not yet been promulgated. As a result, we cannot always determine the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations.
  
  Due in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of these requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and compliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities. To the extent that these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, operating results will be reduced.
  
  In addition, our customers are subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impacts associated with the combustion or other use of coal, which may affect demand for our coal. Changes in applicable laws or the adoption of new laws relating to energy production, greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions from use of coal products may cause coal to become a less attractive source of energy, which may adversely affect our mining operations, the cost structure and, the demand for coal.

  We believe that our competitors with operations in the United States are confronted by substantially similar conditions. However, foreign producers and operators may not be subject to similar requirements and may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in or be subject to similar limitations on their operations. As a result, the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with United States environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our competitive position with regard to those foreign competitors. The specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, applicable legislation and its production methods.
  
  The Mine Act and the MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.
  
  Due to the large number of mining permits held by the Company that have been previously mined and operated, there is a significant amount of environmental reclamation and remediation required by the Company to comply with local, state, and federal regulations for coal mining companies.
  
 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the cost of compliance with environmental laws amounted to $190,940 and $9,806, respectively. This amount represents the costs of the company associated with fines incurred from various regulations regarding environmental and safety compliance; please see elsewhere in this document for additional detail regarding other reclamation and remediation costs.
  
  Property
  
  Our principal offices are located at 9002 Technology Lane, Fishers, Indiana 46038. We pay $2,500 per month in rent for the office space and the rental lease expires in December 2018. We also rent office space from an entity which we consolidate as a variable interest entity (see note 5) at 11000 Highway 7 South, Kite, Kentucky 41828 and pay $500 per month rent and the rental lease expires October 30, 2021.
  
  The Company also utilizes various office spaces on-site at its coal mining operations and coal preparation plant locations in eastern Kentucky, with such rental payments covered under any surface lease contracts with any of the surface land owners.
  
  Employees
  
  ARC, through its operating subsidiaries, employs a combination of company employees and contract labor to mine coal, process coal, and related functions. The Company is continually evaluating the use of company employees and contract labor to determine the optimal mix of each, given the needs of the Company. Currently, McCoy Elkhorn’s Mine #15 and Deane Mining’s Razorblade Surface mine are primarily run by company employees, McCoy Elkhorn’s Carnegie Mine and Deane Mining’s Access Energy mine are primarily run by contract labor, and the Company’s various coal preparation facilities are run by company employees.
  
  The Company currently has approximately 204 employees (excluding personnel hired through contractors), with a substantial majority based in eastern Kentucky. The Company is headquartered in Fishers, Indiana with six members of the Company’s executive team based at this location.

 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
  
 We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

● | A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
● | Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and 
● | No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 


 
 We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Form 10-K, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
  
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.
  
 We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
  
 We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Exchange Act.
