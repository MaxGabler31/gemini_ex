Business Overview
 
MU Global is a beauty and wellness company, providing SPA and wellness service and also SPA related products to the customers. The services provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function.
 
Since our establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry is still in the early stage there is a huge potential for the industry to growth significantly.
 
In year 2020, COVID-19 crisis has resulted the sales of the global beauty and wellness industry weak due to consumers have had limited access to retail outlets and supply chain bottlenecks have reduced product availability. In China, the industry’s sales fell up to 80 percent compared with 2019. Nevertheless, based on Mckinsey and Company research report on April 8, 2021, shows that consumers care deeply about wellness—and that their interest is growing and the global wellness market is estimated at more than US$1.5 trillion, with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities for companies, particularly as spending on personal wellness rebounds after stagnating or even declining during the COVID-19 crisis
 
China has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations in different cities and townships across the country, therefore, it is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a single business model.
 
The advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Company’s early development in the Chinese market.
 
The first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted region.

Second, the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales and revenue growth.
 
Lastly, the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model, which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market operation and a win-win situation between the two parties.
 
Currently, the Company operates in the Chinese market with three business models:
 

1. | Tripartite co-operation and profit sharing model (deployment of stone spa bed & franchise) 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Large-scale chain agent model (deployment of stone spa bed) 
3. | Direct- service store model

1. Bedrock Bathing/ Hot Stone Bath

-




Bedrock Bathing is a method of keeping the body in shape that involves bathers lying down on a heated slab of rocks embedded on a spa treatment bed without using hot water wearing indoor clothing. The original name for this hot stone bathing is ‘Ganban’yoku’, and it is originated from Japan as the term for a popular form of hot stone or bedrock spa. It is also referred to as “stone-bathing”, but there is no actual bathing or water involved.
 
It is our belief that the effects of bedrock bathing are numerous and both aesthetic and metabolic. Furthermore, the rocks selected for this treatment are believed to provide many health benefits when they are heated. The five stones we intend to use are: Black Silica Stone, Radium Stone, Far Infrared Stone, Negative Ion Stone and Beitou Stone. The average time taken for each therapy is approximately 30 minutes.
 
The Company believes that bedrock bathing treatments will assist in the elimination of suboptimal health conditions caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake, and unhealthy lifestyles. The detoxification process will improve general bodily function and immune system, promote blood circulation, and yield visible skin improvement. The treatment is also believed to improve basal metabolism, resulting in more efficient energy utilization within the body, hence sustainable weight loss to a desirable level. Prolonged proper treatments have also been linked to miscellaneous anti-aging benefits.
 
Our pricing strategy offers great flexibility to our customers to opt for the service they desire which is also within their budget. In order to ensure flexibility, the Company has divided the service into three different tiers, each with different pricing strategy: Flagship, Luxury and Refined. Under the three tiers model, Flagship branch and will be the top tier and will target high-end segment with premium pricing packages. Luxury branch is designed to attract middle class individuals. Refined branch on the other side, will aim to attract customer with lower budget, but would still like to enjoy the service.
 
The Company started offering bedrock bathing services in the Shanghai outlet in January 2019. Different service packages are designed for each tier of service, which include option for subscription-based treatments, and pay per services. The packages offer customers either the option of purchasing our treatments at a discounted price if they purchase in bundle, or they can pay for the service every time they use at normal price. The bundle comprises of 3 different number of visits per bundle i.e., 10 times visit package, 20 times visit package, and 30 times visit package. We have also implemented a member database for our bedrock bathing centre. Customers can join our membership at an attracting fee to enjoy the services provided at member price.

The setting displays a concept of thermostatic control for a stone spa bed, which includes a bed, a bed heating element, an energy part, a cover cabin, cover cabin’s opening/closing assembly, a thermostatic control device, and a thermostatic temperature adjustment device. Once the thermostatic temperature adjustment device sets the default temperature, the user can activate the bed heating element after lying down on the stone spa bed. Following the closure of the cover cabin, the bed heating element will start heating from the default temperature to the user’s ideal degree of temperature. Once the session completes, the thermostatic control device will reduce the heating efficiency to the default temperature in order to maintain the heat for the next session, which can largely reduce the heating time and electricity cost-saving.
