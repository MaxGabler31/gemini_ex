--------+---------

GENERAL
 
National Beverage Corp. innovatively refreshes America with a distinctive portfolio of sparkling waters, juices, energy drinks and, to a lesser extent, carbonated soft drinks. We believe our creative product designs, innovative packaging and imaginative flavors, along with our corporate culture and philosophy, make National Beverage unique as a stand-alone entity in the beverage industry.
 
Points of differentiation include the following:
 
Healthy Transformation – We focus on developing and delighting consumers with healthier beverages in response to the global shift in consumer buying habits and lifestyles. We believe our portfolio satisfies the preferences of a diverse mix of consumers including ‘crossover consumers’ – a growing group desiring healthier alternatives to artificially sweetened or high-calorie beverages.
Creative Innovations – Building on a rich tradition of flavor and brand innovation with more than a 130-year history of development with iconic brands such as Shasta® and Faygo®, we have extended our flavor and essence leadership and technical expertise to the sparkling water category. Proprietary flavors and our naturally-essenced beverages are developed and tested in-house and made commercially available only after extensive concept and sensory evaluation. Our variety of distinctive flavors provides us a unique advantage with today’s consumers who demand variety and refreshing beverage alternatives.
Innovation Ethic – We believe that innovative marketing, packaging and consumer engagement is more effective in today’s marketplace than traditional higher-cost national advertising. In addition to our cost-effective social media platforms, we utilize regionally-focused marketing programs and in-store “brand ambassadors” to interact with and obtain feedback from our consumers. We also believe the design of our packages and the overall optical effect of their placement on the shelf (“shelf marketing”) has become more important as millennials and younger generations become increasingly influential consumers, and are now influencing baby boomers and older generations.

Power+ Brands –
 
LaCroix
 


During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, LaCroix introduced the unique flavor of Cherry Blossom – a botanical twist of sweet and just a ‘kiss’ of tart. The distinctive taste and stunning packaging of Cherry Blossom conveys the ‘Dazzling Taste of Spring!’ The launch of Cherry Blossom featured an integrated effort involving social and outdoor media, spot radio, consumer sampling, and attractive retail in-store displays.  In June 2022, PEOPLE Magazine recognized LaCroix Cherry Blossom as the winner of the Flavored Water Category in the PEOPLE's Food Awards 2022.  PEOPLE described Cherry Blossom as "spring in a can...with fruity, lightly floral notes."  
 
Cherry Blossom joins the innovative trio of Beach Plum, Black Razzberry and Guava São Paulo launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Beach Plum excites the imagination and inspires dreams of summer with the delectable coolness of the luscious fruit native to the east coast of the U.S.; the sweet twist of Black Razzberry makes taste buds sing with decadent, smooth and irresistible fruit flavor; and consumers savor the sweet tropical delicacy and vibrant essence of Guava São Paulo.
 

 These innovative new varieties are part of the LaCroix family of 31 refreshingly innocent flavors. 
 
LaCroix’s dynamic ‘theme’ LaCroix Cúrate® (‘Cure Yourself’) celebrates French sophistication with Spanish zest and bold flavor pairings.NiCola® by LaCroix, an innovative sparkling water, captures the ‘crossover’ cola consumers with its ‘innocent’ effect of no calories, sodium, sweetener or any other ingredient that the health-conscious consumer avoids. Our LaCroix NiCola theme includes traditional La Cola along with Coconut Cola, Cubana (Mojito), and Coffea Exotica (Sumatra coffee and cola).
 
Additional LaCroix themes are in development that feature unique packaging and ground-breaking flavor concepts designed to capitalize on LaCroix brand loyalty and growth of the sparkling water category.

Carbonated Soft Drinks –

Shasta® has been recognized as a bottling industry pioneer and innovator for more than 130 years. Shasta features multiple flavors and has earned consumer loyalty by delivering value and convenience with such unique tastes as Raspberry Crème, Tiki Punch, and California Dreamin’.
 



In recent years, we reformulated many of our brands to reduce caloric content while still preserving their time-tested flavor profiles. Our brands, optically and ingredient-wise, are continually evolving. We always strive to make all our drinks healthier while maintaining their iconic taste profiles.
 


PRODUCTION
 

We believe the innovative and controlled vertical integration of our production facilities provides an advantage over certain of our competitors that rely on independent third-party bottlers to manufacture and market their products. Since we control all national production, distribution and marketing of our brands, we believe we can more effectively manage quality control and consumer appeal while responding quickly to changing market conditions.

DISTRIBUTION 
 
To service a diverse customer base that includes numerous national retailers, as well as thousands of smaller “up-and-down-the-street” accounts, we utilize a hybrid distribution system to deliver our products through three primary distribution channels: take-home, convenience and food-service.
 
The take-home distribution channel consists of national and regional grocery stores, club stores, mass-merchandisers, wholesalers, e-commerce stores, drug stores and dollar stores. We distribute our products to this channel primarily through the warehouse distribution system and, to a lesser extent, the direct-store delivery system.
 
Warehouse distribution system products are shipped from our production facilities to the retailer’s centralized distribution centers and then distributed by the retailer to each of its store locations with other goods. This method allows our retail partners to further maximize their assets by utilizing their ability to pick-up product at our warehouses, thus lowering their/our product costs. Products sold through the direct-store delivery system are distributed directly to the customer’s retail outlets by our direct-store delivery fleet and by independent distributors.
 

Our food-service division distributes products to independent, specialized distributors who sell to hospitals, schools, military bases, airlines, hotels and food-service wholesalers. Also, our Company-owned direct-store delivery fleet distributes products to schools and food-service locations.
 
Our take-home, convenience and food-service operations use vending machines and glass-door coolers as marketing and promotional tools for our brands. We provide vending machines and coolers on a placement or purchase basis to our customers. We believe vending and cooler equipment expands on-site visual trial, thereby increasing sales and enhancing brand awareness.

SALES AND MARKETING
 
We sell and market our products through an internal sales force as well as specialized broker networks. Our sales force is organized to serve a specific market, focusing on one or more geographic territories, distribution channels or product lines. We believe this focus allows our sales group to provide high level, responsive service and support to our customers and markets.
 

 Additionally, we maintain and enhance consumer brand recognition and loyalty through a combination of participation in regional events, special event marketing, endorsements, consumer coupon distribution and product sampling. We also offer numerous promotional programs to retail customers, including cooperative advertising support, ‘BrandED’ ambassadors, in-store promotional activities and other incentives. These elements allow marketing and other consumer programs to be tailored to meet local and regional demographics. Additionally, the Company’s ‘MerchMx’ representatives work to develop a rapport with store managers for the purpose of optimizing shelf space, building displays, placing point-of-sale materials and expanding distribution.
 


RAW MATERIALS 
 
Our centralized procurement group maintains relationships with numerous suppliers of ingredients and packaging. By consolidating the purchasing function for our production facilities, we believe we procure more competitive arrangements with our suppliers, thereby enhancing our ability to compete as an efficient producer of beverages.
 

Substantially all of the materials and ingredients we purchase are presently available from several suppliers, although strikes, weather conditions, utility shortages, governmental control or regulations, national emergencies, quality, price or supply fluctuations or other events outside our control could adversely affect the supply of specific materials. A significant portion of our raw material purchases, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, are derived from commodities. Therefore, pricing and availability tend to fluctuate based upon worldwide commodity market conditions. In certain cases, we may elect to enter into multi-year agreements for the supply of these materials with one or more suppliers, the terms of which may include variable or fixed pricing, minimum purchase quantities and/or the requirement to purchase all supplies for specified locations. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.

COMPETITION
 
While LaCroix Sparkling Water is the brand of choice as the number one premium domestic sparkling water throughout the United States, the beverage industry is highly competitive and our competitive position may vary by market area. Our products compete with many varieties of liquid refreshment, including water products, soft drinks, juices, fruit drinks, energy drinks and sports drinks, as well as powdered drinks, coffees, teas, dairy-based drinks, functional beverages and various other nonalcoholic beverages. We compete with bottlers and distributors of national, regional and private label products. Several competitors, including those that dominate the beverage industry, such as Nestlé S.A., PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, have greater financial resources than we have and aggressive promotion of their products may adversely affect sales of our brands.

 
Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry are price and promotional activity, advertising and marketing programs, point-of-sale merchandising, retail space management, customer service, product differentiation, packaging innovations and distribution methods. We believe our Company differentiates itself through novel innovation, key brand recognition, focused social media, innovative flavor variety, attractive packaging, efficient distribution methods, and, for some product lines, value pricing.

 TRADEMARKS
 
 We own numerous trademarks for our brands that are significant to our business. We intend to continue to maintain all registrations of our significant trademarks and use the trademarks in the operation of our businesses.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes regulating the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with such existing legislation.
 
Certain states and localities require a deposit or tax on the sale of certain beverages. These requirements vary by each jurisdiction. Similar legislation has been or may be proposed in other states or localities or by Congress. We are unable to predict whether such legislation will be enacted but believe its enactment would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
All of our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had any material adverse effect on our financial or competitive position. We believe our current practices and procedures for the control and disposition of toxic or hazardous substances comply in all material respects with applicable law.
 

HUMAN CAPITAL
 
At April 30, 2022, we employed approximately 1,580 people, of which 368 are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements generally address working conditions, as well as wage rates and benefits, and expire over varying terms over the next several years. We believe these agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us as they expire and we believe we maintain good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations.
 
We support a culture of diversity and inclusion that mirrors the markets we serve. We take a comprehensive view of diversity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, religions and expressions of gender and sexual identity. Approximately 58 percent and 23 percent of our employee base identify as persons of color or female, respectively.

Our compensation programs are designed to ensure we attract and retain talent while maintaining alignment with market compensation. We utilize a mix of short-term incentive programs throughout the organization and provide long-term incentive programs to more senior employees generally through stock-based compensation programs. We offer competitive employee benefits that are effective in attracting and retaining talent and are designed to support the physical, mental and financial health of our employees. Our employee benefits program includes comprehensive health, dental, life and disability, and profit sharing benefits.
 
Our operating philosophy emphasizes the health and safety of our employees. Our operations personnel, supplemented by risk management professionals, review all aspects of employee tasks and work environment to minimize risk. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment in our operations. Key to these efforts are data analysis and preventative actions. We measure and benchmark lost-time incident rate, a reliable indication of total recordable injuries rate and severity, and use a risk- reduction process that thoroughly analyzes injuries and near misses.
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took comprehensive measures to safeguard the well-being of our employees. These measures included enhanced sanitation procedures, physical distancing, and other health protocols. We continue to monitor the pandemic and its variants to insure the health and safety of our work force.
 
SUSTAINABILITY 
 
National Beverage Corp. is dedicated to sustainable operations and responsible business initiatives. All our beverage products are produced in the U.S., providing thousands of jobs in local communities and boasting a lower carbon footprint than imported brands. In addition, the majority of our products are delivered through the warehouse distribution system which provides more efficient and lower greenhouse gas emissions than direct-store delivery competitors.
 
Water is critical to our business and we periodically conduct water quality assessments on a variety of measurements. All of our packaging is recyclable and we continually focus on reducing packaging content. More than 80% of our products are in aluminum cans, which generally contain approximately 73% recycled material. Each of our facilities has programs in place designed to minimize the use of water, energy, and other natural resources.
