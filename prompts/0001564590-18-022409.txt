Our Markets 
 Our market-focused businesses are organized by technology and products. Our businesses are composed of the following primary markets: Communications, Materials Processing, Military, Semiconductor Equipment, Life Sciences, Consumer Electronics and Automotive. 
 Communications Market
II-VI’s optical communications products and technologies enable the next generation of high-speed optical transmission systems, networks, and datacenter solutions necessary to meet the accelerating global bandwidth demand. At the core of both terrestrial and undersea optical networks, our market-leading 980 nm pump lasers boost the power of the optical signal in the fiber optic cable at intervals along the way to enable a larger number of high speed signals to be transmitted over longer distances. Our latest generation of 980 nm pump lasers along with miniature tunable filters and hybrid passives are part of our ultra-compact family of components critical to a new generation of small size, long reach DWDM transmission modules operating at 100, 200 and 400 Gb/s.
 Customers continue to rely on us for our industry-leading optical amplification and embedded monitoring solutions for their next generation ROADM systems to compensate for the inherent signal loss and to monitor the signal integrity. Our proprietary OTDR modules allow systems to automatically detect and pinpoint issues along the transmission path in real time. The accelerating adoption of applications such as cloud computing are driving the rapid growth of datacenter buildouts. Our high-speed 25 Gb/s VCSELs enable intra-datacenter transceivers to transmit and receive signals. Our miniature WDM thin film filter assemblies are used to increase the bandwidth within 100 GbE transceivers by combining wavelengths at the transmitter end and separating them out at the receiver end.
 In mobile wireless applications, II-VI supplies base SiC substrates to customers who manufacture RF power amplifier devices that are embedded in remote radio heads in 4G wireless bases stations to boost the power of RF signal before it reaches the antenna. These devices are also widely expected to be embedded in next generation active antennas for 5G wireless, where multiple devices per antenna will be required to enable higher bandwidth. SiC has a high number of intrinsic physical and electronic advantages, such as high thermal conductivity, that enable them to operate at high-power levels and still dissipate the excess heat generated. 
 Materials Processing Market
 Our industrial laser optics and solutions for the materials processing market remain in strong demand. There continues to be a steady global demand to support existing installations and new deployments of CO2 and fiber laser systems. Our vertically integrated and market leading ZnSe optics and components, due to their inherent low loss at around 10 micron wavelength, have enabled high-power CO2 laser systems for many decades and remain critical to the steady stream of new deployments as well as to continued operation, serving as replacement optics, of the installed base of CO2 lasers. II-VI continues to introduce products that address new and growing applications for low-power CO2 lasers, such as cutting textiles, leather, wood and other organic materials, for which the CO2 laser’s 10 micron wavelength is ideally suited. CO2 lasers are also at the core of EUV lithography systems, which are now emerging on the market to enable a new generation of smaller and more powerful personal integrated circuits for the internet of things computing devices.   
 Over the past several years, fiber laser-based systems operating at one micron wavelength in pulsed or continuous mode have taken a central role in nearly all materials processing segments, and especially for precision machining such as marking and micro drilling. From the laser chips that generate the input optical power to the beam delivery systems that direct the output optical power to the target, II-VI supplies a broad set of laser optics and fused fiber products that enable many functions within these systems. The same set of II-VI products is also at the core of existing and emerging direct diode laser systems. II-VI is also driving innovation with a direct-diode laser engine small enough to be mounted on a robotic arm so that the end user can apply square beams directly to the work piece at wavelengths optimized for aluminum processing. 
 Another emerging and fast growing application is the processing of displays for consumer electronics, including those based on the OLED technology that are scribed with CO lasers and sealed with UV lasers. II-VI’s broad portfolio of coated optics and crystal materials serve all of these growing laser markets.    
 Military Market
Our focus in the military market is enabling lasers for targeting, night vision, navigation, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems. Multiple fighter jets are equipped with our large area sapphire windows that surround advanced electro-optical targeting and imaging systems. Infrared domes are used on missiles with infrared guidance systems ranging from small, human-portable designs to larger designs mounted on helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and ground vehicles. High-precision domes are an integral component of a missile’s targeting system, providing efficient tactical capability, while serving as a protective cover to its internal components. 
 9


Rotary and fixed-wing aircraft also use missile warning systems to protect against shoulder fired human-portable missiles. Our competencies in material growth for UV crystals and our optical assembly capabilities provide significant support to these missile warning systems. A key attribute of several of these systems is the ability to filter electro-magnetic interference using micro-fine conductive mesh patterns. This technology is also applied to non-optical applications for absorbing and transmitting energy from the surfaces of aircraft and missiles.
 Many military systems employ laser designation and range-finding capabilities supported by our semiconductor lasers bars and solid state laser host crystals and laser optics, all manufactured in-house, as well as our competency in short wave infrared and visible optics. Our thermoelectric coolers are used to increase thermal imaging sensitivity, or to maintain a constant window temperature in various visible and infrared applications.   
 We provide a range of battlefield-ready technologies for soldier equipment and specifically designed variants for law enforcement. Our precision patterned reticles are embedded in rifle scopes. Our reaction bonded boron carbide materials are shaped into torso plates and employed as in-aircraft cabin and protective body armor. Our thermo-electric coolers are used to regulate the soldier’s body heat. They are also used to convert heat produced by battlefield fuel burners into electrical power, for example to extend battery life on the battlefield.   
 We maintain engineering and manufacturing facilities in the United States with strictly controlled access that are dedicated to our U.S. government supported contracts.  
 Semiconductor Capital Equipment Market
Semiconductor equipment requires advanced materials to meet the need for tighter tolerances, enhanced thermal stability, faster wafer transfer speeds and reduced stage settling times. Our metal matrix composites and reaction bonded ceramics enable these applications thanks to their optimum combination of light weight, strength, hardness and coefficient of thermal expansion.  Our reaction bonded SiC materials are used to manufacture wafer chucks, light weight scanning stages and high temperature, corrosion resistant wafer support systems. Our cooled SiC mirrors and precision patterned reticles are used in the illumination systems of lithography tools.  
 In the emerging market of EUV lithography systems, CO2 lasers are used to generate extreme ultraviolet light. These CO2 lasers and beam delivery systems leverage our broad portfolio of CO2 laser optics, CdTe Modulators, high power damage resistant polycrystalline CVD diamond windows to route the powerful laser beam to a tin droplet from which EUV light will emanate. Due to their very high mechanical and thermal performance characteristics, our reaction bonded SiC are used in structural support systems that are integral to EUV lithography optics to meet critical requirements for optical system stability.
Life Sciences Market
 The majority of our business in the life sciences end market is in analytical tools. Many analytical tools found in modern biotech laboratories are based on some form of interaction with light. This applies to flow cytometry, cell sorting, confocal microscopy, DNA genome sequencing, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and particle sizing to name a few. Our multi-colored laser engines along with our broad portfolio of application-specific optics, filters and gratings are embedded in these analytical tools.  We also supply objective lenses, precision patterned reticles and assemblies for microscopes.
 Genome sequencing involves temperature cycling DNA in flow cells with a high degree of temperature uniformity and precision. We believe that our thermal engines are the state of the art in chiller technology, and they achieve what we believe to be industry-leading temperature control and uniformity across large areas. Our green lasers are used to excite the fluorescence of DNA to reveal its structure. Our flow cells are micro-machined with a high degree of precision to insure the smooth flow of sample fluids undergoing analysis. Our thermal engines are also used in a multitude of other biomedical applications, for example to measure substance concentration in complex mixtures, to protect blood supplies and to perform heating- and cooling-based physical therapy. 
 Clinical procedures are increasingly performed with tools that embed our lasers and optics. For example, our semiconductor laser bars are used in hair and wrinkle removal procedures and our custom designed lens assemblies are used for laser eye surgery. We continue to leverage our core lasers, optics and temperature control expertise into new applications to grow our business in life sciences.
 Consumer Electronics Market
II-VI manufactures low cost VCSELs, VCSEL arrays and low angle shift filters for the consumer electronics market. Our VCSEL products leverage our world-class 6-inch GaAs platform, combining our epitaxial wafer growth and wafer fabrication capabilities.
 10


Our VCSELs, unlike many on the market, have already been designed into consumer products such as the computer mouse as well as for menu navigation in smart phones and in car steering wheels. Our VCSELs are also widely deployed in datacenters and in the emerging market for HDMI optical cables. This expertise in VCSEL technology is being leveraged for the emerging 3D sensing market. With our acquisitions of 6-inch epitaxy and wafer capabilities, we have invested significantly to round out our capacity expansion.
 Automotive Market
Power conversion electronics for high-efficiency electric vehicles need a combination of high-power density, high-efficiency and high-temperature operation that are only afforded by advanced material systems based on SiC substrates. Our SiC substrates are available in large diameters and have what we believe to be best-in-class quality and low defect levels.
 Our thermoelectric modules are used to cool batteries to extend their operating life. They are also more efficient than resistive heaters when used in heated car seats and extend an electric vehicle’s range of travel in cold environments.
 To operate safely, self-driving cars will rely on control systems that are informed by a comprehensive number of sensors. One such sensor is based on LiDAR, which employs semiconductor lasers to properly identify and measure the distance to obstacles ahead. Our GaAs-based semiconductor laser platform, which already enables a broad portfolio of products in communications and materials processing, is now being scaled further for consumer electronics, and will be leveraged to deliver a highly reliable and cost-effective laser product for this emerging market.

Research, Development and Engineering 
 During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company continued to identify, invest in and focus our research and development on, new products in an effort to accelerate our organic growth.  This approach is managed under a disciplined innovation program that we refer to as the “II-VI Phase Gate Process.”
 From time to time, the ratio of externally funded contract activity to internally funded contract activity varies due to the unevenness of government funded research programs and changes in the focus of our internally funded research programs. We are committed to having the right mix of internally and externally funded research that ties closely to our long-term strategic objectives. 
 We devote significant resources to RD&E programs directed at the continuous improvement of our existing products and processes and to the timely development of new technologies, materials and products. We believe that our RD&E activities are essential to establish and maintain a leadership position in each of the markets we serve. As of June 30, 2018, we employed 1,513 people in RD&E functions, 1,439 of whom are engineers or scientists. In addition, certain manufacturing personnel support or participate in our research and development efforts on an ongoing basis. We believe this interaction between the development and manufacturing functions enhances the direction of our projects, reducing costs and accelerating technology transfers.

 The development of our products and manufacturing processes is largely based on proprietary technical know-how and expertise. We rely on a combination of contract provisions, trade secret laws, invention disclosures and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We have entered into selective intellectual property licensing agreements. We have asserted in the past, and expect that we will continue to assert and vigorously protect our intellectual property rights. We have a total of approximately 800 patents globally.  
 Internally funded research and development expenditures were $117.2 million, $96.8 million and $60.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Export and Import Compliance 
 We are required to comply with various export/import control and economic sanction laws, including: 
  
• | The International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export from the United States of certain defense articles and defense services, which generally include items that are specially designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the U.S. Munitions List;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on certain dual-use goods, technology and software, which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on U.S. foreign policy and national security considerations; and

 Foreign governments have also implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdiction. For additional discussions regarding our import and export compliance, see the discussion set forth in Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Annual Report Form on Form 10-K. 
 Trade Secrets, Patents and Trademarks 
 Our use of trade secrets, proprietary know-how, trademarks, copyrights, patents and contractual confidentiality and IP ownership provisions help us develop and maintain our competitive position with respect to our products and manufacturing processes. We aggressively pursue process and product patents in certain areas of our businesses. We have entered into selective intellectual property licensing agreements. We have confidentiality and non-competition agreements with certain personnel. We require that our U.S. employees sign a confidentiality and non-competition agreement upon their commencement of employment with us. 
 The design, processes and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components and subsystems are innovative, complex and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled.
