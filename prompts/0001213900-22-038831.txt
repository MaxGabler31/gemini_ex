Worldwide Demand for Weekend Family Farms



Family Weekend Farming is growing in popularity across the world. Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia have established small-scale agricultural production spaces early on, focusing on urban residents’ close proximity to farming and farming villages in urban or rural areas. Based on this, they have systematically developed functions of providing rest areas and children’s education centers as well as mental and physical health. The names of these types of spaces are also called differently depending on the history and culture of each country. England is called ‘Allotmentgarden’ and means ‘a divided garden’. And Germany means ’small garden’ because it is ‘Klingarten’. It originated from the Russian era when Russia granted land in the name of ‘Dacha’, meaning ‘to share’. Japan accepts the concept of Kleingarten in Germany and calls it a “citizen farm.” In addition, Japan clarifies the definition of citizen farm concept through the Citizen Farm Improvement Promotion Act, and actively expands and distributes it to foster national sentiment, maintain health, and preserve farmland. In Korea, there are already “weekend farms” outside the city however, compared with the forms still being done in these foreign countries, it is only a beginning stage. Until now, this type of facilities in foreign countries had been referred to as “national farms,” “weekend farms,” “leisure farms,” and “hobby farms,” but the term “family farms” was deemed to be the most appropriate rather than weekend farms.



Weekend family farms were divided into three types: urban, suburban, and stay-type family farms. Among the three types, urban and suburban types are mainly focused on improving the welfare of urban residents, such as providing rest areas and the venue for children’s spaces, but the focus is on revitalizing rural communities by promoting urban and rural exchanges. In the case of stay-type, there is a limit to being established as a social welfare concept because it is a project designed to attract urban residents to revitalize rural areas.



The Size of the California and United States Weekend Family Farming Market is relatively new in execution and concept. Therefore, HIGR Family Weekend Farm is uniquely positioned to monetize the growth if this sector and become a strong leader in these emerging areas of
