Item 1.    BUSINESS 
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biopharmaceutical products. We are developing novel medications for central nervous system (CNS) disorders with a focus on abuse-deterrent medications. Our lead investigational product candidate, ADAIR, is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent oral formulation of immediate-release dextroamphetamine (the main active ingredient in Adderall®) for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, over five million adolescents and adults misuse prescription stimulant medications on an annual basis. The misuse and abuse of prescription stimulants has substantial medical risk, including risk of irregular heartbeat, heart attack, seizures, hallucinations, hostile behavior and stroke, as well as increased risk of addiction. ADAIR is designed to deter attempts to crush and snort and to provide barriers to injection while still providing the expected therapeutic benefit when taken orally.
We are developing ADAIR for registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which is expected to obviate the need for large Phase 2 and Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies. In July 2018, our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for ADAIR was approved by the FDA. We have completed three Phase 1 trials of ADAIR including a proof-of-concept intranasal human abuse potential study. We have also completed a 13-week preclinical toxicology study on the final formulation of ADAIR that showed no safety findings of concern. We are currently conducting the SEAL study, a pivotal intranasal abuse study, and have completed its patient enrollment and treatment phases. The SEAL study enrolled 55 subjects who successfully passed the qualification phase with a total of 53 completing the study. We expect to report top-line results of the SEAL study in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, we continue to conduct preclinical studies and manufacturing work and evaluate the potential for any additional studies to support the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for ADAIR to the FDA. 
In January 2020, we entered into a license agreement (the Medice License Agreement) with Medice, which grants Medice an exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, market and sell ADAIR throughout Europe. Under the Medice License Agreement, Medice paid us a $0.1 million upfront payment and will pay milestone payments of up to $6.3 million in aggregate upon achieving certain regulatory and sales milestones. We are also entitled to low-double digit tiered royalties on net sales of ADAIR.
In addition to ADAIR, we completed formulation development work and selected the final formulation of our second product candidate, ADMIR, an abuse deterrent formulation of methylphenidate (Ritalin®), for the treatment of ADHD. We also plan to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for registration of ADMIR.
In the future, we plan to use our abuse deterrent platform technology to develop other products that have potential for abuse in their current forms and will continue business development activities and seek partnering, licensing, merger and acquisition opportunities or other transactions to further develop our pipeline and drug-development capabilities.
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to present uncertainty and unforeseeable new risks to our operations and business plan. We have closely monitored recent COVID-19 developments, including states’ lifting COVID-19 safety measures, drops in vaccination rates, and the spread of various coronavirus strains such as the Delta and Omicron variants. In light of these developments, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and clinical development plans remains uncertain and will vary depending on the pandemic’s future impact on our clinical trial enrollment, clinical trial sites, clinical research organizations (CROs), third-party manufacturers, and other third parties with whom we do business, as well as any legal or regulatory consequences resulting therefrom. To the extent possible, we are conducting business as usual, with necessary or advisable modifications to employee travel and with most of our employees and consultants working remotely. We will continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other third parties with whom we do business.
Reverse Split
In February 2021, we filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which effected a one-for-40 reverse stock split (the reverse split) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of the reverse split, every 40 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were reclassified into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split and any fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share.

All share and per share amounts contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K give retroactive effect to the reverse split.
Medice License Agreement
On January 6, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Medice, who is affiliated with one of our principal stockholders, Salmon Pharma, and represented by one member of our board of directors, which grants Medice an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to develop, use, manufacture, market and sell ADAIR throughout Europe. Medice currently markets several ADHD products in Europe and is the ADHD market leader in Europe based on branded prescription market share. Medice is responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of ADAIR in the licensed territory. Under the license agreement, Medice paid us a minimal upfront payment and will pay milestone payments of up to $6.3 million in the aggregate upon first obtaining regulatory approval to market and sell ADAIR in any country, territory or region in the licensed territory and upon achieving certain annual net sales thresholds. For the term of the license agreement, Medice will also pay tiered royalties on annual net sales of ADAIR at rates between 10% and 20%. The initial term of the license agreement will expire five years after the date on which Medice first obtains regulatory approval in any country, territory or region in the licensed territory. Medice has the option to extend the term of the license agreement for additional periods of five years each. Medice has the right to terminate the license agreement at any time upon twelve months’ prior written notice to us. We have the right to terminate the license agreement immediately upon notice if Medice challenges the validity, enforceability or patentability of any patent right comprising the licensed intellectual property. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations under the license agreement, provided that the terminating party gives the breaching party notice of the breach and a specified opportunity to cure the breach, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy.
Intellectual Property
We strive to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights developed internally and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We currently have two issued U.S. patents directed to specific ADAIR formulations (i.e., composition of matter) and one pending patent application for ADAIR that is under examination with the U.S. PTO. The U.S. patents will expire in 2037. We have one issued European patent which expires in 2038. Our international PCT application has entered national phase is under examination in several foreign countries and territories, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and Japan. We also rely on know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available.
Employees
As of February 4, 2022, we had three full-time employee and had engaged six consultants. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our current relations with our employees to be good.
Facilities
Our executive offices are located at 100 N. 18th Street, Suite 300, Philadelphia, PA 19103. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs. Should we be required to obtain additional space in the future, we believe we can obtain the required facilities at competitive rates. 
Legal Proceedings
We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). Emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we also intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved, exemption from the requirement of auditor attestation in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or (iv) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.
