ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are principally engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products for human use in connection with a variety of high-incidence and high-mortality diseases and medical conditions prevalent in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). All of our operations are conducted in the PRC, where our manufacturing facilities are located. We manufacture pharmaceutical products in the form of dry powder injectables, liquid injectables, tablets, capsules, and cephalosporin oral solutions. The majority of our pharmaceutical products are sold on a prescription basis and all of them have been approved for at least one or more therapeutic indications by the National Medical Products Administration (the “NMPA”, formerly China Food and Drug Administration, CFDA) based upon demonstrated safety and efficacy.



As of December 31, 2021, we manufactured 19 pharmaceutical products for a wide variety of diseases and medical indications, each of which may be classified into one of three general categories:




● | Basic generic drugs, which are common drugs in the PRC for which there is a very large market demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | First-to-market generic drugs, which are generic western drugs that are new to the PRC marketplace; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modern Traditional Chinese Medicines, which are generally comprised of non-synthetic, plant-based medicinal compounds that have been widely used in the PRC for thousands of years. We apply modern production techniques to produce pharmaceutical products in different formulations, such as tablets, capsules or powders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In selecting generic drugs to develop and manufacture, we consider several factors, including the number of other manufacturers currently producing this particular drug, the size of the market for that drug, the proposed or required method of distribution, the existing and expected pricing for that particular drug in the marketplace, the costs of manufacturing that drug, and the costs of acquiring or developing the formula for that drug. We believe that generic drugs we have always been selecting to manufacture have large addressable markets and higher profit margins relative to other generic drugs manufactured and distributed in the PRC.



In addition, we manufactured comprehensive healthcare products and protective products.



We currently own and operate two production facilities in Haikou, Hainan Province, PRC. One has a construction area of 663.94 square meters, the other factory has two buildings with production area of 20,282.42 square meters and 6,593.20 square meters. We implement quality control procedures in this facility in compliance with the PRC’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP standards, and applicable NMPA regulations to ensure consistent quality in our products.





1







The NMPA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) on February 12, 2011 (effective as of March 1, 2011) (the “Year 2011 GMP Standards”). The Year 2011 GMP Standards outlines the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the pharmaceutical products manufacturing industry in the PRC. All of our production lines: tablets, capsules, dry powder, liquid injectables, solid oral solution Cephalosporins (specifically designated), are in full compliance with the Year 2011 GMP Standards. A newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect on December 1, 2019. The New Law cancelled the GMP certification but impose the pilot inspection mechanism in the event that if any production line(s) does not satisfy any pilot inspection under the New Law, the production on such production line(s) could be suspended.



We market and sell our products through 16 sales offices covering all major cities and provinces in the PRC. To comply with applicable Chinese laws relating to sales of prescription drugs to certain hospitals and clinics, we also use a distribution system comprised of over 1,000 independent provincial-level, city-level, and county-level distributors. Our sales system has further developed and expanded with the expansion of Chinese healthcare reform, and our 16 provincial offices deliver our products to basic health care institutions as well as tier two and tier three hospitals through the above mentioned distributors.



Our corporate organizational chart is set forth below.

Industry Background and Market Opportunities



According to the data of China’s National Bureau of statistics, the domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing industry achieved a revenue of RMB2,129 billion (approximately US$330 billion) and a net income of RMB452billion (approximately US$70 billion) in the first three quarters of 2021, which represented an increase of 24.4% and 80.6%, respectively, as compared to the numbers in the same period in the previous year. The high growth rate was mainly due to the low base effect due to COVID-19. If the compound growth rate of the last two years is used for analysis, the growth rates of revenue and net profit of China’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry are 8.2% and 37.6% respectively, the industry has recovered to the growth level before the epidemic.



While fully enjoying the dividend of rigid demand, the development of the pharmaceutical industry is also under the pressure of medical insurance fee control. According to the data of China’s National Bureau of statistics, the proportion of China’s population over the age of 65 has increased from 7% in 2000 to 13.5% in 2020. With the gradual deepening of population aging, the demand continues to be strong, but the ensuing medical insurance pressure has also become the main theme of industrial policy changes in recent years.



On one hand, more and more people use medical insurance funds; on the other hand, fewer and fewer people pay premiums. Under this circumstance, population aging has become one of the main factors aggravating the imbalance of medical insurance fund. According to The Statistical Bulletin on The Development of National Medical Security in 2020 issued by China’s National Bureau of statistics, the number of people participating in national basic medical insurance reached 1.36 billion in 2020, and the participation rate remained stable at more than 95%. According to the national medical security plan for the 14th five-year-plan issued by the General Office of the State Council of China on September 29, 2021, personal health expenditure occupied 27.7% of the total health expenditure in 2020, and it is planned to be reduced to 27% in 2025. This means that the vast majority of medical and health expenditure is being borne by the government and society. Under the background of medical insurance adjustment, domestic drug sales have also experienced great changes. The use of adjuvant drugs has gradually fallen out of favor, giving up the share of medical insurance funds for specialized drugs and tumor drugs with more clinical efficacy. Under such policies, pharmaceutical enterprises have to carry out innovation and transform. And the overall environment of deepening medical reform has greatly reduced the profits of generic pharmaceutical enterprises in China.



China National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”) has gradually promoted volume-based procurement for the entire national market, therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturers have greatly reduced the price in order to win the bid. Since the start of procurement in 4 + 7 cities in 2018, there have been six rounds of practices, showing the following trend:



The market scale gradually expanded: from 11 pilot cities to 31 provincial regions in China.



The number and category of drugs involved increased: each batch expanded from about 30 in the early stage to about 60.





3







Drug prices dropped significantly: the total purchase amount of six batches of centralized procurement exceeded RMB200 billion, with an average price drop of more than 50%. This significantly reduced the price of drugs, thus materially cutting the expenditure of medical insurance funds.



In addition, we also observed that the medical demand and consumption level have continued to improve in recent years, and the value of high-quality medicine with innovation and consumption attributes has become prominent. These include: China’s State Council issued Some Policies and Measures on Accelerating The Characteristic Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in February 2021. This policy proposes to follow the development law of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM);conscientiously sum up the experience and practice in preventing and treating of COVID-19 using TCM; promote the complementary and coordinated development of TCM and Western medicine.



Impact from the New Coronavirus Global Pandemic (“COVID-19”)



COVID-19 has been raging around the world for more than two years since its outbreak in late 2019. Based on its characteristics of high infectivity and low mortality, the epidemic around the world has tended to recur and rebound in the past two years. On the whole, the form of COVID-19’s prevention and control is still quite grim. Obviously, the epidemic has had a far-reaching impact on the development of the global pharmaceutical industry.



So far, the epidemic situation in China has been well controlled, and the number of new confirmed cases overseas has continued to recur. Recently, due to overseas influence, the domestic epidemic situation in China has shown a trend of local distribution; while on the whole, it can be prevented and controlled. The number of confirmed cases has always remained relatively low, and the long-term prevention and control effect is remarkable. China’s National Health Commission reported on February 24, 2022 that the number of vaccinations of COVID-19 vaccine in China exceeded 3.1 billion. The COVID-19 vaccines are widely vaccinated in China, and the immune barrier has been preliminarily formed.



Looking ahead, the organic combination of “prevention” and “treatment” is the key to controlling the continuous fermentation of the epidemic worldwide. It mainly depends on:



1. From the perspective of prevention and control: physical protection (quarantine) and vaccination have built an extensive barrier, which has greatly reduced the “spillover” of local epidemic situations;



2. Treatment perspective: neutralizing antibodies have significantly benefited the clinical patients with mild to moderate coronary syndrome, and the small molecule COVID-19 that have successively demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy are expected to alleviate the huge pressure on medical resources.

Consistency Evaluation for Generic Drugs



The “consistency evaluation of generic drugs” (“Evaluation”) refers to the evaluation of generic drugs that were approved for market, for the consistency with the quality and efficacy of the original drug. The goal is for generic drugs to achieve the same level of quality and efficacy as the original drugs and to replace the original drugs in clinical use. This can not only save medical expenses, but also improve the development of the pharmaceutical industry, and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of public drug use.



In early stage, China’s generic pharmaceutical enterprises were mixed, the State issued a notice on the Evaluation of generic drugs in 2013, and formally started to promote this Evaluation in 2015. In 2018, a few drugs passed the Evaluation. The health insurance started drug procurement on the basis of the drugs passed the Evaluation.



On January 17, 2019, the State Council released the “Pilot Program for the Centralized Procurement and Use of Drugs by the State Organization” (“the Program”). According to the plan, the trial drugs are selected from the generic drugs that have passed the consistency evaluation, and the state organizes the centralized purchase of drugs to reduce the drug price and reduce the burden of drug expenses on patients. The national centralized procurement document also clearly requires that the participating generic products must pass the Evaluation. With the continuous promotion of the Evaluation, since the start of mass procurement in the 4+7city in 2018, six rounds of mass procurement have been carried out so far. The first five batches of procurement involved a total of 218 drugs, with an average price reduction of 52-59%, focusing on chemical drugs; the sixth batch procurement focused on insulin, with an average reduction of 48%.



Our company has actively promoted the Evaluation process of several important products in 2021.



The PRC’s medical insurance system



Medicare is the largest purchaser of medical services in China. Entering the Medicare catalogue will greatly help speed up the large-scale sales of drugs. China’s medical insurance catalogue used to be adjusted every five years. After the establishment of the NHSA in May 2018, it was adjusted every two years. The frequency of products entering the medical insurance catalogue has greatly accelerated. Facing the increasing demand for medical and health care and the increasing pressure of medical insurance, how to make efficient use of medical insurance funds has become the focus of medical insurance catalogue adjustment in recent years. As can be seen from the adjustment over the years:




1. | The coverage of medical insurance catalogue continued to be increased. According to the data of the Chinese government network, the number of drugs in the medical insurance catalogue increased from 2196 in 2009 to 2800 in 2020.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5








2. | Encourage innovation. Since 2016, China has conducted five national dynamic medical insurance negotiations, and many innovative drugs have been rapidly and massively sold through medical insurance negotiations. According to the medical insurance catalogue released by the China National Medical Security Bureau and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the number of successful negotiations increased from 3 in 2016 to 119 in 2020.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Pay equal attention to both TCM and Western medicine treatment. In the national medical insurance catalogue over the years, the number of TCM products has always accounted 40% - 50%, which fully reflects the importance of TCM.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Medical insurance cost control is the background of the current policy. From the perspective of both income and expenditure of medical insurance, payment standards improve slowly, and the population of people purchasing premiums may continue to decline with the change of population structure. With the continuing of aging population, the demand for medical care of the elderly population has increased. In order to reduce the pressure of medical insurance fund and promote rational drug use, the China National Health Commission (NHC) and NHSA have issued a series of policies and measures, including:



Strict control of adjuvant drugs: in 2019, the China National Health Commission issued The First Batch of National Key Monitored Rational Drug Use Drug Catalogue, so as to reduce the use of adjuvant drugs and apply more medical funds for drugs with rigid demand.



Cancel local supplement: before the establishment of the NHSA, all provinces can supplement and adjust the Category B Reimbursement Drug List of Medical Insurance. In August 2019, the NHSA issued a document requiring the cancellation of the provincial supplementary list, and it is required to be completed within three years. It ensures that all authorities for the adjustment of the medical insurance catalogue are controlled by the State, to reduce the occupation of medical insurance funds by local governments.



National centralized procurement of drugs: the intermediate link of drug sales leads to a huge difference between the factory price and the terminal price. The NHSA has started the centralized procurement of drugs since 2019. As long as the pharmaceutical company wins the bid, the sales volume is guaranteed, and the intermediate link is eliminated. Up to now, six rounds of national centralized procurement have been carried out, and the average drug price has decreased by more than 50%, saving hundreds and billions of medical insurance funds.



We believe that under the background of national medical insurance cost control, centralized procurement of drugs and medical insurance negotiation should be the new norm.



Centralized Procurement of Drugs (CPD)





6







At present, six rounds of CPD have been carried out, showing the following trend:



The scope has been gradually expanded: from 11 pilot cities to 31 provincial administrative regions, from public hospitals to military hospitals, and private hospitals and medical insurance pharmacies are encouraged to participate.



Increase in the number of drugs: from about 30 in the early stage to about 60. The drugs participated in the early stage were mainly oral dosage, while there were 30 injection medical products included in the fifth round.



According to the data of Southwest Securities Research Center, as of December 2021, six batches of centralized procurement have covered 234 drugs, involving an amount of about RMB240 billion (approximately US$37 billion), accounting for about 30% of the purchase fund of chemical and biological drugs in public medical institutions. Almost all the core generic drugs of domestic pharmaceutical companies have been covered.



On November 4, 2021, NHSA issued The Notice On Doing A Good Job In The Succession Work After The Expiration Of The National Organization Drug Centralized Procurement Agreement, so as to ensure the smooth succession after the expiration of the procurement agreement.



Our Strategy



We believe that the pursuit of innovation is imperative for providing the basic medical solutions needed by the majority of patients. We are passionate about protecting human health, and we always adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity to fulfill our firm commitment to our customers and patients.



We believe we are well-positioned in a comparatively steadily growing industry in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. With China’s per capita GDP exceeding US$12,000 in 2021, consumption structure upgrade, and the establishment of a high-quality health care system has become one of the most important tasks. We currently manufacture a number of off-patent branded generic drugs. Our diverse portfolio of products and new product pipelines include products for high-incidence and high-mortality conditions in the PRC, such as cardiovascular, central nervous system (“CNS”), infectious, and digestive diseases. We launched several Epidemic prevention products such as wash-free sanitizers and various types of masks since the outbreak of COVID-19 at year end 2019. In addition, we continue to explore comprehensive healthcare market after the launch of Noni enzymes in 2018.



Consistency evaluation of our current existing major products will be the focus of our strategy in the near future. The consistency evaluation of generic drugs will improve Chinese generic drugs quality and eliminate unqualified enterprises, so that high-quality generic drug companies are expected to benefit from it. Consistency evaluation, together with the centralized drug procurement, are optimizing the competitive landscape of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. We believe that the market space and growth potential for Chinese generic drugs are huge.

A series of medical reform policies introduced in recent years has profound and far-reaching impact on pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, early considerations of the transformation and upgrading, as well as product positioning become very important. Based on more than twenty-year experience in R&D, production and marketing experiences, and our market insights, we have decided to gradually adjust our strategy to produce generic and innovative drugs with high value in pharma-economics, good clinical efficacy and market differentiation. These include drugs that treat chronic diseases prevalent in China, such as geriatric diseases, cancers, and nutritional products.



In addition, as another direction of strategic development, we will actively explore connectivity on the Internet. After the advent of the Internet era, marketing is no longer a vertical down logical relationship, but a decentralized form of interconnection. We will take the initiative to learn, participate, and put our products to the online market, to achieve online and offline connectivity of a complete ecological system. 



Our objective is to leverage our expertise in the PRC for the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to achieve this objective by:



Promoting Our Existing Brands to Increase Our National Recognition. We intend to support and grow the existing recognition and reputation of our brands and to maintain our branded pricing strategy through continued sales and marketing efforts through our new, upgraded GMP-compliant production lines. To achieve this goal, we plan to promote the efficacy and safety profile of our established prescription pharmaceutical products to physicians at hospitals and clinics in all provinces of PRC through the efforts of our sales force, independent distributors and educational physician conferences and seminars.



Promoting the progress of consistency evaluation of our current existing main products. We intend to cope with the latest policies and the GPO requirements. We aim to make efficient use of our existing human and material resources, and strive to create favorable conditions for product sales and international development through gaining a favorable result in the consistency evaluation.



Exploring on the consumption healthcare market. Consumption healthcare generally refers to products or services that have certain medical features and can bring health improvement to consumers, but are mainly paid by individuals (less dependent on medical insurance) and have brand effect. We have observed that it has become a high growth field in recent years. It is not limited by medical insurance, and has low penetration rate and high growth. It covers the fields of consumption of traditional Chinese medicine, physical examination, health care, rehabilitation and so on. We will continue to actively explore this niche market.





8







Expanding Our Distribution Network to Increase Market Penetration. We intend to expand our reach beyond our current 16 offices in the PRC to drive additional growth of our existing and future products. We currently contract with over 1,000 distributors in the PRC and plan to expand on these relationships to target new markets. We will continue our conservative sales strategy of increased cooperation with customers with reliable accounts receivable collection performance. In addition, we plan to continue to broaden our marketing efforts outside of major cities in the PRC and to increase our market penetration in cities and rural areas where we already have a presence. Over the long term, we also intend to expand our presence beyond the PRC to international markets by working with international pharmaceutical companies to cross-sell our products.
Explore CDMO services. Since the State Council of China issued The Pilot Scheme of Drug Marketing License Holder System in 2016, we have been actively exploring the CDMO market, especially in the field of high-end manufacturing. We will focus on developing CDMO of pharmaceutical preparations required in the whole life cycle from preclinical, clinical trials, scale-up manufacturing to drug marketing. Make full use of our more than two decades of whole process experience in China’s pharmaceutical industry to engage in pharmaceutical formula research, development, NMPA production application, industrialization and commercialization. We strive to achieve internal and external coordination and complement each other’s resources and advantages.
Acquiring Complementary Products Lines, Technologies, Distribution Networks and Companies. We intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will grow our customer base, expand our product lines and distribution network, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. Pursuing strategic acquisitions is a significant component of our growth strategy. The Company has not identified any strategic acquisition opportunities as of the date of this report on Form 10-K.
Products



We currently have a product portfolio of 22 products, including 19 pharmaceutical products that address a wide variety of diseases and medical indications, and the remaining are comprehensive healthcare and protective products. All of our pharmaceutical products have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials sufficient to obtain approval by the NMPA and are sold on a prescription basis. The following table summarizes the approved indications for our marketed products and the year in which each of such products was first marketed to our customers.

Due to the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, we continually strive to change our product portfolio to respond to changes in market demand. Based on a foundation established by a number of our widely-recognized prescription products, such as Cefaclor and Roxithromycin, we have launched and will continue to launch a variety of pharmaceuticals. The core criteria for our selection of potential pipeline products is strong market demand, proven efficacy, and safety. In an effort to gain an advantage in the marketplace, we often seek to improve the production process of the new generic products we elect to manufacture or to improve the quality of a proposed product to increase its efficacy.



We also adjust the delivery systems and marketing for each of our products based on the product’s target patient group. We believe that maintaining a variety of delivery systems (e.g. tablets, capsules, injectables and dry powders) for certain of our products targeted at different groups enhances our competitive position in the marketplace. As a result, our sales and marketing personnel work closely with management and our research and development personnel to determine which of our products can successfully be marketed for more than one delivery system and which generic drugs in the marketplace may be good candidates for us to manufacture and distribute using different delivery systems.



Product Development



Research & development and innovation represent the core competitive advantage for a company’s sustainable growth. For pharmaceutical companies, products with proprietary intellectual property are not only strategic resources for comprehensive strength, but also important tools to engage in social responsibility. We have been focusing on the research and development of both first generic drugs and innovative drugs. Additionally, we also have actively worked to meet unfulfilled medical needs by sticking to a market-oriented approach and continuously improving the effectiveness and ease of use of our drugs, which are supported by our well-designed system for intellectual property management.
The PRC State Council issued “Opinions on Carrying out Consistency Evaluation on Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs” on March 5, 2016, requiring all manufacturers of generic chemical pipeline products to carry out Consistency Evaluations before they may obtain final registration approval. Drugs failing to meet these requirements may not be re-registered.



Currently, due to this newly issued NMPA production approved standards and experimental requirements, as with all other Chinese generic pharmaceutical companies, almost all of our pipeline products have undergone major adjustments.



The Company’s recent research and development work is mainly aimed at promoting the consistency evaluation of several major products already on the market, as well as the continued exploration of comprehensive health product categories.



Distribution and Customers



We believe we have a well-established sales network. As our current pharmaceutical product portfolio is comprised mainly of prescription drugs, our major sales targets are hospitals. As of December 31, 2021, we have 16 sales offices covering all major provinces of China, and over 1,000 sales representatives who assist in managing the delivery of pharmaceutical products, and our promotion and service with hospitals, doctors and local drug distributors.



Due to the nature of our products and current governmental regulations, all of our customers are located in the PRC. We have established long-standing relationships with most of our key customers through our operating subsidiary, Hainan Helpson Medical & Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Helpson), which was formed in 1993.

Production Facilities



We manufacture and package our products at our manufacturing facility in the Haikou Free Trade Zone in Haikou, Hainan Province. Our old manufacturing facility, which was built in 2002, is approximately 8,000 square meters (approximately 12.4 million square feet); and our new building, approximately 20,000 square meters (approximately 31 million square feet), was completed in 2013. We have production lines conforming with the 2011 version of GMP certificates for different forms of our products including: tablets, capsules, dry power, liquid injectables, solid oral solution Cephalosporins (specifically designated); other than that, we also have production lines for health care products and various types of masks that meet national standards.



All of our existing production lines have met the GMP Standards which became effective as of March 1, 2011. On December 1, 2019, the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect, which cancelled the GMP certification but impose the pilot inspection mechanism.



Raw Materials



We require a supply of a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. We employ purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products who work with our product development, and formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for our products. Currently, we rely on numerous suppliers in the PRC and overseas to deliver our required raw materials and believe we have at least three principal suppliers for each of our most critical raw materials. Historically, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials from suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our purchases of raw material purchases from our three top suppliers accounted for 24.8%, 12.7%, and 11.8%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020 suppliers accounted for 20.7%, 17.7% and 13.5%, respectively.
Competition



We believe we have established a commercially competitive position in the highly-fragmented pharmaceutical industry in China through our core competitive advantages, as described below:



We have a highly-efficient commercialization process for new products, including significant experience with the NMPA registration process.



We have over 20 years of product-development experience during which time we have implemented processes to efficiently introduce and market new and existing products to the Chinese market.



We have a market-oriented product portfolio and product lines.



Our product focuses on developing and manufacturing medicines that help large patient groups, such as the infectious disease and cardio vascular disease patient groups. Our diversified GMP-certified manufacturing facility includes various production lines targeting a variety of delivery mechanisms, such as tablets, capsules, cephalosprine tablets, cephalosprine capsules, liquid-injectables and dry powder injectables, which enables us to effectively manufacture a broad range of new drugs; other than that, we also have production lines for health care products and various types of masks that meet national standards.





13







We have product diversification to target specific sub-markets.



We attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors by changing, and, in many cases, improving certain physical aspects of our products to market to different market segments. For example, to make our Cefaclor product more patient friendly to children and patients with swallowing problems, we added an enteric coating to make our tablets easier to swallow.



We have a national sales network and a highly-trained marketing team.



Our experienced sales team has industry knowledge and know-how to synergistically combine our strong market insight with successful commercialization platforms.



We have developed high-quality relationships with leading hospital and clinic administrators and physicians.



While sales of our pharmaceutical products to hospitals are made through our distributors, we believe our long-term relationships with leading hospitals and healthcare clinics throughout China resulting from our long-term promotional efforts and periodic physician seminars improve the perception of our products in the marketplace and help us identify and select high-volume drugs to develop into new generic products relatively early in the process.



Notwithstanding such favorable positioning, we are subject to intense competition. There are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar pharmaceutical products in the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, better manufacturing and marketing capability, and more experience than we do.



Our profitability may be adversely affected if:




● | the number of our competitors increases; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | competitors engage in increased price competition; or 
● | competitors develop new products or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects that are more effective, less costly and/or have more perceived benefits than those produced by us.




In addition, imported products and China’s admission as a member of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) creates increased competition. The PRC became a member of the WTO in December 2001. As a result, competition in the pharmaceutical industry in the PRC intensified generally in two respects. First, with lower import tariffs, imported pharmaceutical products manufactured overseas may become increasingly competitive in terms of pricing. Second, we believe that well-established foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply of competitively-priced pharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face increased competition from foreign pharmaceutical products, especially in terms of high-end pharmaceutical products, including certain types of products manufactured by U.S. manufacturers.



Intellectual Property



We regard our packaging designs, trademarks, trade secrets, patent and similar intellectual property as parts of our core competence that are critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, distributors and others to protect our intellectual property rights.



In November 2008, we purchased the patented medical formula and the manufacturing processes for a cerebral/cardio-vascular indication from a third party laboratory. In connection with that acquisition, we obtained the title of the patent. This patent expires in 2025.



In 2012, we acquired another patent related to a medical formula for the treatment of cerebral/cardio-vascular diseases. This patent expires in 2029.



As of December 31, 2021, we owned 18 registered trademarks, including marks for eight of the 19 pharmaceutical products we manufacture, including the tradenames Fukexing, Beisha, Shiduotai, Xinuo, Pusenlitai, Pusenouke, Shuchang, Shenkaineng, XERONINE, and Aronino, as well as marks for our AFGF logo, our HPS logo, our two HELPSON logos and four other logos. The registration numbers of the 18 registered trademarks are as follows: No.1500459, No.1511770, No.1535416, No.1537828, No.1535420, No.1272792, No.1272760, No.1330294, No.1327731, No.1330295, No.3993785, No. 4074317, No.4074321, No. 4315247, No. 32445705, No. 32437940, No. 34711564, and No. 34711561.

Environmental Matters



We comply with the Environmental Protection Law of China as well as applicable local regulations. In addition to statutory and regulatory compliance, we actively ensure the environmental sustainability of our operations. Penalties may be levied upon us if we fail to adhere to and maintain certain standards. Such failure has not occurred in the past, and we do not anticipate that it will occur in the future, but no assurance can be given in this regard.
Regulations



Regulations Relating to Pharmaceutical Manufacture Industry. The pharmaceutical manufacture industry in China is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the NMPA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer and producer of medicinal products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the NMPA and its provincial and local branches. The Medicinal Product Administration Law of the People’s Republic of China provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. These regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general.



Registration and Approval of Medicine. Pursuant to the PRC Provisions for Drug Registration, a medicine must be registered and approved by the NMPA before it can be manufactured and sold. The registration and approval process requires the manufacturer to submit to the NMPA a registration application containing detailed information concerning the efficacy and quality of the medicine and the manufacturing process and the production facilities the manufacturer expects to use. A series of policies on consistency evaluation and drug review process have been issued in recent years, and potentially more reforms and adjustments are underway in order to promote the pharmaceutical industry in China in line with the international standards. In this context, we believe that the uncertainties in the timetables for obtaining NMPA production approvals for products under research are increasing. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a pre-clinical medicine, it is also required to conduct pre-clinical trials, apply to the NMPA for permission to conduct clinical trials and go through the clinical trials. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a post-clinical medicine, it only needs to go through the clinical trials. In both cases, a manufacturer needs to file clinical data with the NMPA for approval to manufacture after clinical trials are completed.



New Medicine. If a new medicine is approved by the NMPA, the NMPA will issue a new medicine certificate to the manufacturer and impose a monitoring period from one to five years. During the monitoring period, the NMPA will monitor the safety of the new medicine, and will neither accept new medicine certificate applications for an identical medicine by another pharmaceutical company, nor approve the production or import of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. As a result of these regulations, the holder of a new medicine certificate has the exclusive right to manufacture it during the monitoring period. We currently have the new medicine certificates for our Pusenouke, Cefaclor dispersible tablets and Roxithromycin dispersible tablets and Bumetanide for injection products.
National Production Standard and Provisional Standard. In connection with the NMPA’s approval of a new medicine, the NMPA will normally direct the manufacturer to produce the medicine according to a provisional national production standard, or a provisional standard. A provisional standard is valid for two years, during which time the NMPA closely monitors the production process and quality consistency of the medicine to develop a national final production standard for the medicine, or a final standard. Three months before the expiration of the two-year period, the manufacturer is required to apply to the NMPA to convert the provisional standard to a final standard. Upon approval, the NMPA will publish the final standard for production. The NMPA has no statutory timeline to complete its review and grant approval for the conversion. In practice, the approval for conversion to a final standard is time-consuming and could take a number of years. However, during the NMPA’s review period, the manufacturer may continue to produce the medicine according to the provisional standard.





15







Transitional Period. Prior to the latter of (1) the expiration of a new medicine’s monitoring period or (2) the date when the NMPA grants a final standard for a new medicine after the expiration of the provisional standard, the NMPA will not accept applications for an identical medicine nor will it approve the production of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, the manufacturer will continue to have an exclusive production right for the new medicine during this transitional period.
Continuing NMPA Regulation



Pharmaceutical manufacturers in China are subject to continuing regulation by the NMPA. If the labeling or its manufacturing process of an approved medicine is significantly modified, a new pre-market approval or pre-market approval supplement will be required by the NMPA. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is subject to periodic inspection and safety monitoring by the NMPA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements.



The NMPA has a variety of enforcement actions available to enforce its regulations and rules, including fines and injunctions, recall or seizure of products, imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension or complete shutdown of production and criminal prosecution.



Pharmaceutical Product Manufacturing



Permits and Licenses for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit from the NMPA’s relevant provincial branch. This permit is valid for five years and is renewable for an additional five-year period upon its expiration. Our current pharmaceutical manufacturing permit, issued by the NMPA, will expire on November 8, 2025. We are confident the permit could be renewed before its expiration.
Good Manufacturing Practice. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet the Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or GMP standards, for each of its production facilities in China in respect of each form of pharmaceutical product it produces. GMP standards include staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, environmental hygiene, production management, quality control and customer complaint administration. Prior to December 1, 2019, if a manufacturer meets the GMP standards, the NMPA will issue to the manufacturer a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate, or a GMP certificate, with a five-year validity period. However, for a newly-established pharmaceutical manufacturer that meets the GMP standards, the NMPA will issue a GMP certificate with only a one-year validity period. The Year 2011 GMP Standards became effective on March 1, 2011, and pharmaceutical manufacturers (except for manufacturers of injectables, blood products or vaccines, which had a three-year grace period) had a five-year grace period to upgrade existing facilities to comply with the revisions.



All of our existing production lines have met the Year 2011 GMP Standards. On December 1, 2019, the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect. One of the major amendments is the cancellation of GMP certification. The New Law eliminated the requirement that drug administration authorities shall assess drug manufacture enterprises and drug trading enterprises, and issue assessment certificates. Instead, it requires that drug manufacturing enterprises and drug trading enterprises establish and improve the quality management systems of manufacture and trade of drugs, and ensure that the process of manufacturing and trading of drugs always meets all legal requirements. This means a stricter form of supervision is implemented comparing to the prior GMP certificates system。 Our production lines are subject pilot inspection under the New Law.



We believe that GMP inspection only switches to another form, which includes flight inspection, drug production license inspection (for on-site management and quality system), as well as product inspection.

Product Liability and Consumers Protection



Product liability claims may arise if any of our pharmaceutical products have a harmful effect on a consumer, who may make a claim for damages or compensation as an injured party. The General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, stated that manufacturers and sellers of defective products causing property damage or injury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries. The Civil Code of the PRC, which came into force on January 1, 2021, stipulates that if damage is caused to others due to defects in products, the infringed can claim compensation from the manufacturer of the products or the seller of the products. If the defect is caused by the producer, the seller shall have the right to recover compensation from the producer. If the product is defective due to the fault of the seller, the producer shall have the right to recover from the seller after making compensation.



The Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers’ rights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines, and in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.



The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect consumers when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.



Other Regulations



In addition to the regulations relating to pharmaceutical industry in China, Helpson is subject to the regulations applicable to a foreign invested enterprise in China.



Foreign Currency Exchange. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 1997 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interests and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.



Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies other than foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) must convert foreign currency payments they receive from abroad into Renminbi. On the other hand, FIEs may retain foreign currency in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks, subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local counterpart.



Dividend Distribution. Under the PRC regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these foreign-invested enterprises are required to set aside certain amounts of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Employees



As of December 31, 2021, we had 246 employees, among which 236 employees were full-time employees and 10 employees were temporary employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and, in general, we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



As required by applicable Chinese law, we have entered into employment contracts with substantially all of our officers, managers and employees. We are working towards entering into employment contracts with those employees who do not currently have employment contracts with us. The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment contracts and employee handbook and are in compliance with such law.
