ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

On the Move Systems Corp. (“OMVS”) was incorporated in Florida on March 25, 2010. OMVS reincorporated into Nevada on February 17, 2015. OMVS’s fiscal year end is February 28. OMVS is located at 701 North Green Valley Parkway, Suite 200, Henderson, Nevada 89074, and the telephone number is 702-990-3271.

OMVS’s prior business focus was transportation services, and we were previously exploring the on-demand logistics market by seeking to develop a network of logistics partnerships. On August 28, 2017, OMVS acquired all of the outstanding shares of Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “RAD” or the “Company”). Following the RAD acquisition, our business consists of delivering artificial intelligence (“AI”) based solutions to solve complex enterprise problems and challenges while delivering an immediate return on investment. Our initial goal is to disrupt and capture a significant portion of the $30+ billion human security guard market(1) and the $20+ billion physical security market (cctv, access control, intercom) and become a key driver in the $1+ billion managed security services market(2) through its innovative RAD Software Suite and manufactured solutions which combine the most desired features of both industries in a compact, cloud based mobile environment.

Recent Developments

On August 28, 2017, OMVS entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with RAD and Steve Reinharz, as sole stockholder of RAD. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, on August 28, 2017, OMVS acquired 10,000 shares of RAD’s common stock, representing all of RAD’s issued and outstanding capital stock, from Mr. Reinharz in exchange for the issuance of (i) 3,350,000 shares of its Series E Preferred Stock and (ii) 2,450 shares of its Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result of the RAD acquisition, RAD became a wholly owned subsidiary of OMVS. RAD was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.
Business

Our business consists of seeking to deliver AI based solutions to solve complex enterprise problems and challenges while delivering an immediate return on investment. We have initially targeted the security industry, which utilizes electronic systems and further involves approximately 1.1 million security guards in the U.S. alone. We plan to provide our AI robotic solutions to companies and governments so that they can employ such solutions for the purposes of protecting their assets, whether those assets are government, commercial or industrial. We believe that our security guard solutions combine both robotic and AI solutions to provide a superior solution to our clients which can save them money on their security needs. 

RAD was incorporated as a limited liability corporation under the laws of the State of Wyoming in July 2016 and later reincorporated (as a C corp.) in the State of Nevada in July 2017. RAD’s mission is to deliver artificial intelligence solutions to solve complex and expensive enterprise organizational challenges. We believe that RAD’s robotic solutions can improve the security services of any enterprise due to advanced technology that is always on, compared to human guarding where it is difficult to maintain non-stop attention in mundane or dangerous guarding roles.

Founded by Mr. Steve Reinharz in the summer of 2016, RAD originally partnered with SMP Robotics Systems Corp (SMP) to commercialize the SMP S5 Robot for the security industry. RAD’s commercialization of the platform focused on integrating traditional security industry manufacturers’ solutions onto the robotics platform. After two paid proof of concepts for large utility companies (under an NDA) and over 18 months of development and testing, RAD began deployments with various Fortune 500 customers. These deployments were scheduled to begin in October 2017, but were delayed until December 2017 due to various supply chain challenges. 

- 1 -

 By April 2017 it was apparent that the S5 platform promotion and development was not sustainable and RAD pulled its robots from service. With over 40 attempted deployments, it appeared that the S5 Robots were being rejected by customers due to their unreliability and certain technical flaws which could not be solved despite full efforts by both SMP and RAD. SMP has shared that they expect to solve these technical issues with an updated version to their S5 Robot but no firm date of the release has been provided. As a result, RAD has shifted its solutions to its Security Control and Observation Tower (“SCOT™”), its RAD Software Suite and future solutions 100% developed and owned by RAD. It is possible moving forward that RAD will cease to be an SMP dealer, however it expects no impact on its’ business if the SMP relationship ends. RAD calls its current lineup of solutions the ’2nd Generation of electronic guarding solutions.’

RAD’s primary strategy has always been to use AI technology and modern systems to transform the security industry. Mobile robots, indoor and outdoor, are a part of that strategy. RAD will continue to pursue such avenues but sees SCOT™ and its forthcoming derivatives as its primary source of revenue for the remainder of 2018.

The development of SCOT™ began in August 2017. SCOT™ performs many of the same functions of a stationary human security guard, plus many features that human guards cannot perform, at approximately 15% of the cost. We are unaware of any comparable solution available today that blends technology, usability, special features and cost. This is why SCOT™ has seen growing demand and has received considerable accolades. As a result, the Company has accelerated SCOT™’s development and the RAD Software Suite. 

SCOT™ runs on the RAD Software Suite, as all current and future RAD security solutions will. This software suite is a cloud and mobile based solution that is at the heart of RAD’s security solution.

The beta release of SCOT™ took place in Ohio at the end of February 2018. Security representatives from Cincinnati Reds, Bengals, Cincinnati Police Department and the County of Hamilton Sheriff’s Department were present and gave SCOT™ and the preliminary RAD Software Suite a tremendous endorsement. SCOT™ was officially launched on April 2, 2018, a week before the ISC West show, the largest security show in the U.S. SCOT™’s first three deployments were made on April 9 to two clients. Both clients have since requested additional SCOT™ units for their facilities. 

At the ISC West show in April 2018, SCOT™ won three awards: (1) a SIA New Product Award for Law Enforcement/Guarding, (2) 2018 Secure Campus Award from Campus Security and Life Safety and (3) a ‘Govie’ award for government security solutions from Security Today. We were notified we won a ‘money saving’ award from an additional, non-industry organization which was made public in June 2018.

The Security Industry Association’s (SIA) New Product Showcase recognizes innovative products, services and solutions in electronic physical security, and SCOT™’s award comes in the Law Enforcement/Guarding Systems category. Technologies within the program are used in the protection of life and property in residential, commercial and institutional settings, displaying SCOT™’s importance in long-range human detection and acting as a force multiplier for safety and defense against outside threats.

RAD’s business shift to SCOT™ and its future derivatives is complete and current facilities can produce up to 100 units per month with moderate additional investment in equipment, space and manpower. The SCOT™s are primarily furnished to customers using a Solutions-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) recurring revenue model.

The Company’s mission is to improve customer security services of all types of enterprises while providing significant operating cost reduction through deployment of AI based solutions and systems. We believe that RAD’s solutions can improve an enterprise security services due to advanced technology that is always on, compared to human guarding where it is difficult to maintain non-stop attention in mundane guarding roles. The security guard industry suffers from low client satisfaction, high turnover and can be a source of new liabilities for clients. Security guards often just ‘punch the clock’ and sometimes perform functions that are little more than ‘being there’. 

Our belief that RAD Solutions are positioned to provide improved performance and lower costs to create a major disruption to the security industry are well substantiated by the interest and partnerships from major US corporations including Allied Universal Services. Discussions with the top 5 US guarding companies further substantiates that new electronic solutions must be adopted to improve customer service, to meet growing demand, to allow flexibility in meeting new government employment requirements, to respond to customer requests for lower costs, and to provide modern solutions and enhanced performance.

 SCOT™

The SCOT™ is a standalone remote, portable, self-sufficient security observation tower designed to expand an organization’s security reach instantly. RAD’s unique power system allows SCOT™ to be quickly placed virtually anywhere for short- or long-term deployments with zero investment/planning in any supporting infrastructure.

Its use of AI based technology allows it to deliver guarding services at a fraction of the cost and it is considerably more affordable than any human or automated solution on the market.

SCOT™ is equipped with AI that powers human detection analytics, featuring the longest-range detection at low false alarm rates. In addition, SCOT™ debuts the RAD Software Suite, which is a collection of integrated software applications hosted in Microsoft’s Azure Cloud services and allows immediate and mobile access to alerts and controls generated by SCOT™. Each tower is equipped with the latest artificial intelligence technologies:


▪ | Human detection analytics – SuspectSpotter 
▪ | License plate recognition – LicenseSpoter 
▪ | Standalone power – RAD Power Systems 
▪ | MAC Tracker™ capabilities – through BOLO Technologies 
▪ | Long-range paging 
▪ | Close-range video intercom 
▪ | Customizable wraparound LED panels 
▪ | Long-range high deterrence visibility 
▪ | Cellular connectivity and WiFi standard 
▪ | Credential validation and access control (optional) 
▪ | 24/7 equipment monitoring from RAD through the Robot Monitoring Center 
▪ | 24/7 security functions monitoring by 3rd parties or by the end users (or any combination thereof) 
▪ | Security/Help/Panic button 
▪ | Large Tablet featuring security and concierge services PLUS video conferencing with the SOC or guards in the field
▪ | Over-the-air software updates 
▪ | Digital signage for concierge services or emergency/security messaging 
▪ | Cloud processing 
▪ | Various physical and anti-tamper security features 
▪ | Self-powering option for up to 10 days 


RAD has completed development of two iterations of the SCOT™: 


▪ | Wally™ is a wall-mounted version of SCOT. It features a single camera and speaker (versus 4 for SCOT™) and was created from feedback by SCOT™’s Ohio presentations. Wally™ is designed to perform lobby guard activities as well as be mounted inside parking structures and block walls. Wally™ is indoor/outdoor rated and, like SCOT™, is IP65 rated and can operate up to 8 days on battery power. Wally™ uses the RAD Software Suite while connecting to the third-party monitoring of the customer’s choice. Instead of SCOT™’s LED digital signage, Wally™ uses a 10” HD screen that can display digital signage and full video as desired by the end user. Wally™ integrates with RAD’s Visitor Management system and Facial Recognition system just as SCOT™ does. Wally™’s official introduction will be in June, 2018.
▪ | Facial Recognition Entry Device (“FRED”) is an add-on to the RAD Software Suite that uses facial recognition to grant access through gates and doors. This was specifically requested by several customers and prospects. FRED is designed to perform facial recognition for outdoor gate applications, main entry applications and general high security applications. FRED is a purpose-built RAD Software Suite device meaning that it does not run the entire Software Suite. FRED focuses on Visitor enrollment and entry, employee entry, help and information. 

The RAD Software Suite

RAD’s Software Suite encompasses a suite of software applications that replace functionality for the most used security legacy hardware and software. Implemented in RAD’s hardware solutions, the RAD Software Suite delivers security services plus concierge, marketing and data collection services. 

- 3 -

 Introduced on April 2, 2018, the software suite is based on the following principles:


▪ | Legacy security technology such as video management systems do not take full advantage of modern technology because their pricing model restricts implementing new technologies, specifically cloud-based recording and serving of video equipment. RAD’s software can be taught to an operator in less than 15 minutes, significantly less time than many other legacy solutions. This is due to a complete ground-up software design that did not need legacy connections plus the application of security industry specific experience.
▪ | Modern cloud focused software design can be applied to provide dramatic functional improvement to electronic security systems. Specifically, AI based human detection, facial recognition and pattern behavior. Using AI based solutions is essential given its reliability, accuracy and low cost. 
▪ | The Security Operations Center that has been an industry stalwart can be augmented and/or replaced by better systems at a fraction of the cost. 
▪ | Intelligent solutions such as those offered by RAD collect and provide useable data, in real time, to clients. This is in contrast to many traditional industry solutions that typically offer forensic features and benefits. 


The RAD Software Suite is 100% designed, developed and owned by RAD. RAD’s primary software solution includes but is not limited to the following:


▪ | RADGuard™: This is the primary software that provides visitor and/or customer with links to Help, Entry functions and other customized features requested by the customer. 
▪ | RADSoC™: Cloud-served complete Security Operations Center Communications software application that allows monitoring at the Security Operating Center (SOC) to see and communicate with SCOT
▪ | RAD Mobile Control™: This software platform allows end users to access and monitor SCOT™ features from any portable device 
▪ | Where’s My SCOT™: For placing and tracking SCOT™ from order, through production to delivery status. It is also a tool to use for planning SCOT™ placements. 


RAD’s ’Where’s My SCOT™’ was custom developed so that RAD dealers and end users can have access so that new rental orders can be entered via self-serve. 

Sales & Marketing Strategy

RAD solutions’ primary use cases include the following:


▪ | Critical infrastructure - Boosting the protection of any critical infrastructure site where the end user needs more control over an expansive area. Example applications: Vehicle/manned gates, perimeters, difficult-to-staff locations 
▪ | Home Owner’s Associations - Providing an inexpensive way to bolster security without breaking the bank, providing eyes and ears to the entrance of a neighborhood without the infrastructure or investment of a human guard. 
▪ | Recreational & shopping facilities - RAD’s technological capabilities and customizable alerts make it the perfect security solution for high-trafficked recreational facilities such as sports arenas or malls. Example applications: parking areas, entrance areas
▪ | Corporate Campuses - Security and credential validation capabilities make RAD’s solutions the perfect security solution for employee and visitor access control. Example applications: parking areas, entrance areas 
▪ | Distribution Centers - SCOT™ can work for vehicle, visitor and employee entrances, as well as interior/perimeter areas. 


RAD will primarily use its guarding dealer channel to deliver solutions to the market. Guarding companies are cognizant of the fact that failure to adopt new technology will severely impact their business in the future. The guarding partnership model is valuable as it provides RAD with instant access to the largest consumers of guarding services, the Company’s primary target market. RAD’s dealer network currently totals over 800 reps.

RAD’s software is provided free to customers with a RAD hardware solution. RAD’s software strategy is to create as many connections as possible, at low cost, so that the RAD Software Suite becomes the dominant control system for security and other systems.

Artificial Intelligence: Object Recognition

RAD’s neural network can be customized to a variety of customer needs and utilizes best-in-breed AI algorithms from a variety of vendors. RAD’s use of base level algorithms allows for easy integration of different features for different uses and ensures that RAD is never reliant on any one vendor. RAD maintains complete control over its Software Suit and the ability to enhance its features and options.
Competition and Competitive Strengths

We are unaware of any comparable solution available today that blends technology, usability, special features and cost while focusing on partnering with industry and law enforcement to effect realistic improvements to security while providing a return on investment. 

As the robotics industry continues to grow one can expect a number of new ventures, start-ups, and university research programs to develop products that could compete with the Company. Some outside of the security industry believe security robots, stand alone or mobile, compete against closed-circuit television providers, but cameras do not provide a physical presence, are typically used for forensics after an event, and do not offer a client the plethora of capabilities available in the RAD Software Suit/SCOT™/SOC combination. The Company believes that having these systems working together provides a more effective approach.

The Company also competes indirectly with private physical security firms that provide clients with security personnel and other security services. There are more than 8,000 such firms in the U.S. alone. The Company’s SCOT™ offers clients a significant cost reduction compared to traditional security guards. In addition, the Company’s SCOT™ offers significantly more capabilities, such as license plate detection, data gathering, and people detection that are delivered consistently, on a 24/7 basis, without human intervention. In most cases, the Company’s technology complements and improves the operations of traditional security firms.

 The Robotics Industry

International Data Corporation (“IDC”) has identified robotics as one of six Innovation Accelerators that will drive digital transformation by opening new revenue streams and changing the way work is performed. In the new Worldwide Commercial Robotics Spending Guide, IDC forecasts global spending on robotics and related services to grow at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 17% from more than $71 billion in 2015 to $135.4 billion in 2019. Such broad-based growth in robotic adoption is being driven by increasing labor costs, shortage of skilled labor, and an increasing emphasis on repeatable quality in conjunction with a reduction in prices of robotic systems and strategic national initiatives. There were over 41,000 professional service robots sold in 2015 valued at $4.6 billion, up 25% from the year before.

The service robotics market is expected to reach $23.9 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 15.2% between 2016 and 2022 with professional service robots holding the largest market share of the service robotics market in 2015. Professional service robotics is currently the most widely developed and deployed application area of service robots in terms of market value. The market is expected to be driven by the increase in demand for logistics applications. However, other emerging professional applications such as telepresence and inspection and maintenance are expected to fuel the overall service robotics market during the forecast period. The security robots market is expected to reach $2.4 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 8.6% between 2016 and 2022 with North America expected to hold the largest share during this period.
