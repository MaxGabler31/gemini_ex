Operating History
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2003 and have been publicly held and subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements since 2003. We were initially formed as Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. and on March 8, 2012, we changed our name to Retail Properties of America, Inc.
Business Objectives and Strategies
In 2012, management began transforming our portfolio in an effort to focus the portfolio on high quality, multi-tenant retail properties. The core objective of this effort was to become a prominent owner of multi-tenant retail properties primarily located in certain markets. We believe that a geographically focused portfolio allows us to optimize our operating platform and enhance 
1

our operating performance. The markets we identified include: Dallas, Washington, D.C./Baltimore, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix and Austin, which generally feature one or more of the following characteristics:

• | well-diversified local economy;


• | strong demographic profile with significant long-term population growth or above-average existing density, high disposable income and/or a highly educated employment base;


• | fiscal and regulatory environment conducive to business activity and growth;


• | strong barriers to entry, whether topographical, regulatory or density driven; and


• | ability to create critical mass and realize operational efficiencies.

We completed our portfolio transformation during the first half of 2018 and as a result of these efforts, we have strengthened our portfolio and balance sheet and have geographically focused our portfolio. Since our inaugural investor day in 2013, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures, we have (i) improved our retail annualized base rent (ABR) by 32% to $19.11 per square foot as of December 31, 2018 from $14.46 per square foot as of March 31, 2013, (ii) increased our concentration in lifestyle and mixed-use properties by 18% based on multi-tenant retail ABR to 34% as of December 31, 2018 from 16% as of March 31, 2013, and (iii) reduced our indebtedness by 37% to $1,628,450 as of December 31, 2018 from $2,601,912 as of March 31, 2013. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 87.2% of our multi-tenant retail ABR was in the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), as determined by the United States Census Bureau and ranked based on the most recently available population estimates.
We have been primarily focused on growing our portfolio organically through accretive leasing activity and mixed-use redevelopment and expansion projects. In 2018, we signed 512 new and renewal leases across 3,407,000 square feet of GLA for a blended comparable re-leasing spread of 6.0%. In addition, we completed the major redevelopment construction activities at Reisterstown Road Plaza in 2017 and reclassified the property from active redevelopment into our retail operating portfolio during the three months ended December 31, 2018. Our active and near-term expansion and redevelopment projects consist of approximately $390,000 to $430,000 of expected investment during 2019 to 2022 and include the redevelopment portion of Circle East, the first phase of Carillon and the redevelopment of the existing multi-family rental units at Plaza del Lago, as well as pad developments and expansions at several of our mixed-use and lifestyle centers, including Downtown Crown, Main Street Promenade and One Loudoun Downtown. Our current portfolio of assets contains several additional projects in the longer-term pipeline, including, among others, future projects at Merrifield Town Center, Tysons Corner, Southlake Town Square, Lakewood Towne Center and One Loudoun Uptown.
Competition
In seeking new investment opportunities, we compete with other real estate investors, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, private equity funds, private individuals and other real estate companies.
From an operational perspective, we compete with other property owners on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, location, visibility, quality and aesthetic value of construction, and strength and name recognition of tenants. These factors combine to determine the level of occupancy and rental rates that we are able to achieve at our properties. Because our revenue potential may be linked to the success of retailers, we indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our retail tenants experience when trying to attract customers. These factors include other forms of retailing, including e-commerce and direct consumer sales, and general competition from other shopping centers. To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly. We believe the principal factors that retailers consider in making their leasing decisions include:

• | consumer demographics;


• | quality, design and location of properties;


• | diversity and perceived quality of retailers within individual shopping centers;


• | management and operational expertise of the landlord; and

2


• | rental rates.

Based on these factors, we believe that the size and scope of our property portfolio and operating platform, as well as the overall quality and attractiveness of our individual properties, enable us to compete effectively for retail tenants. We believe that our geographically-focused strategy enhances our ability to drive revenue growth by more thoroughly understanding the local market dynamics and by increasing our market relevancy.
Tax Status
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the taxable income we distribute to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We have one wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary that has jointly elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A TRS is taxed on its net income at the generally applicable corporate tax rate. The income tax expense incurred through the TRS has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Regulation
General
The properties in our portfolio, including common areas, are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to allow access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe our existing properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur significant capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding compliance with the ADA.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation, remediation, natural resource damages or third party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several.
Independent environmental consultants conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments or similar environmental audits for all of our investment properties. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a written report that identifies existing or potential environmental conditions associated with a particular property. These environmental site assessments generally involve a review of records and visual inspection of the property, but do not include soil sampling or ground water analysis. These environmental site assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information regarding environmental matters.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance coverage inclusive of fire, extended coverage, earthquakes, terrorism and loss of income insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. We believe that the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. Terrorism insurance is carried on all properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for more information. The terrorism insurance is subject to exclusions for loss or damage caused by nuclear substances, pollutants, contaminants and biological and chemical weapons. Insurance coverage is not provided for losses attributable to riots or certain acts of God.

Recent Tax Updates
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances.
The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus dated November 2, 2018 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018.
Recent FATCA Regulations
On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) promulgated proposed Treasury Regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. While these proposed Treasury Regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed Treasury Regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions). As a result, the following revisions are made to the prospectus:

• | In the first sentence under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Holders of Certain Fixed Rate Debt Securities—Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of Debt Securities—Disposition of the Debt Securities,” the phrase “(subject to the discussion below regarding FATCA withholding)” is deleted; and


• | The last two sentences in the paragraph under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act Withholding Rules” are replaced with the following: “Withholding under this legislation applies with respect to any payment of interest, dividends, and certain other types of generally passive income if such payment is from sources within the United States. However, the following payments are not subject to FATCA withholding: (i) income from our stock or our debt securities that is treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States; or (ii) distributions and proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our stock or our debt securities.”

Recent Partnership Audit Regulations
On December 21, 2018, the IRS adopted final Treasury Regulations under Sections 6221-6241 of the Code to implement the centralized partnership audit regime and applicable finalized Treasury Regulations retain the ability of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership to use deficiency dividend procedures with respect to partnership adjustments resulting from a “push-out election.”
Clarifications
Finally, certain discussions in the prospectus are clarified. The discussion of TRSs is clarified in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that, among other amendments, deleted former Section 163(j)(3)(C) of the Code, which imposed certain limits on the ability 
4

of a TRS of a REIT to deduct interest payments made by such TRS to such REIT. As a result, the following revisions are made to the prospectus in the second paragraph under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Investments in TRSs”:

• | the third sentence is deleted; and


• | the fourth sentence is revised as follows: “For example, we will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the TRS if the economic arrangements among us, our tenants, and/or the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.”

Further, the discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders— Distributions” is clarified to explain that the exception to withholding under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 on distributions with respect to a class of our common stock or preferred stock that are attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of United States real property interests for 10% or smaller holders may apply only if such class of common stock or preferred stock is regularly traded an established securities market located in the United States.
