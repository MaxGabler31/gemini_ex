Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
Yum China Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as “Yum China” and, together with its subsidiaries the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on April 1, 2016. The Company’s U.S. office is located at 7100 Corporate Drive, Plano, Texas, 75024, which carries on the key book-keeping, record-keeping and day-to-day management functions of the holding company, and the telephone number at that location is (972) 338-7530. The Company’s operational headquarters is located at Yum China Building, 20 Tian Yao Qiao Road, Shanghai, 200030, People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”), where its senior management team is based. Our website address is http://www.yumchina.com. The reference to the Company’s website address is for informational purposes only, does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.
 
“U.S. dollars”, “$” or “US$” refers to the legal currency of the United States, and “RMB” or “Renminbi” refers to the legal currency of China. 
 
References to “our” or “the Company’s” restaurants or restaurant system include references to restaurants owned or franchised by us.
 
Spin-off Transaction
 
The Company separated from Yum! Brands, Inc. (“YUM” or the “Parent”) on October 31, 2016 (the “separation”), becoming an independent, publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution (the “distribution”) of all outstanding shares of Yum China common stock to shareholders of YUM. On October 31, 2016, YUM’s shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 19, 2016 received one share of Yum China common stock for every one share of YUM common stock held as of the record date. Common stock of Yum China began trading “regular way” under the ticker symbol “YUMC” on the New York Stock Exchange on November 1, 2016.
 
In connection with the separation of the Company from YUM, Yum! Restaurants Asia Pte. Ltd. (“YRAPL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of YUM, and Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited (“YCCL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Yum China, entered into a 50-year master license agreement with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to YCCL being in “good standing” and unless YCCL gives notice of its intent not to renew, for the exclusive right to use and sublicense the use of intellectual property owned by YUM and its subsidiaries for the development, promotion and operation of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to 3% of net system sales from both our Company and franchise restaurants. We own the East Dawning and Little Sheep intellectual property and pay no license fee related to these concepts.
 
The KFC, Pizza Hut, East Dawning, Little Sheep and Taco Bell brands are collectively referred to as the “brands” or “concepts”. Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “brands” and “concepts” are used interchangeably and “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably.

General
 
We are the largest restaurant company in China, with over 7,900 restaurants as of year-end 2017, and $7.1 billion of revenues, net income of $403 million and $1.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Our growing restaurant base consists of China’s leading restaurant concepts, including KFC, Pizza Hut, East Dawning, Little Sheep and Taco Bell. We have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), and own the East Dawning and Little Sheep concepts outright. We were the first major global restaurant brand to enter China in 1987 and we have developed deep operating experience in the market. We have since grown to become one of China’s largest restaurant developers covering over 1,200 cities as of December 31, 2017.
 
As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated approximately 90% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to our revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales. KFC is the leading quick-service restaurant (“QSR”) brand in China in terms of system sales and number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2017, KFC operated over 5,400 restaurants in over 1,200 cities across China. Measured by number of restaurants, we believe KFC has a two-to-one lead over the nearest Western QSR competitor in China and KFC continues to grow in both large and small cities. Pizza Hut is the leading casual dining restaurant (“CDR”) concept in China as measured by system sales and number of restaurants. We believe Pizza Hut, with over 2,100 restaurants in over 400 cities as of December 31, 2017, has an approximately four-to-one lead in terms of number of restaurants over its nearest Western CDR competitor in China.
 
Restaurant Concepts
 
Most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in and carry out food. In addition, KFC, Pizza Hut and East Dawning offer delivery service. We have also made investments in delivery outside our concepts, including via the acquisition of a controlling interest in the holding company of DAOJIA.com.cn (“Daojia”), an established online food delivery service provider.
 
Each concept has proprietary menu items, many developed in China, and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients, as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and convenient food at competitive prices.
 
Following is a brief description of each concept, as well as the recent Daojia acquisition:
 
KFC
 
KFC is the largest restaurant brand in China in terms of system sales and number of restaurants. Founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders in 1939, KFC opened its first restaurant in Beijing, China in 1987. As of December 31 2017, there were over 5,400 KFC restaurants in China, and the Company plans to continue adding new units. In addition to Original Recipe chicken, KFC in China has an extensive menu featuring pork, seafood, rice dishes, fresh vegetables, soups, congee, desserts and many other products, including premium coffee. The KFC brand is also seeking to increase revenues from its restaurants throughout the day with breakfast, delivery and 24-hour operations in many of its locations.

Pizza Hut
 
Pizza Hut is the leading CDR brand in China, as measured by system sales and number of restaurants, operating in over 400 cities as of December 31, 2017 and offering multiple dayparts, including breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea. The first Pizza Hut restaurant in China opened in 1990, and as of year-end 2017, there were over 2,100 Pizza Hut restaurants in China. Pizza Hut has an extensive menu offering a broad variety of pizzas, entrees, pasta, rice dishes, appetizers, beverages and desserts. In 2017, Pizza Hut was ranked the “Most Preferred Casual Dining Restaurant” in China by The Nielsen Corporation.
Other Concepts and Daojia
 
Little Sheep. A casual dining brand with its roots in Inner Mongolia, China, Little Sheep specializes in “Hot Pot” cooking, which is very popular in China, particularly during the winter months. Little Sheep had over 280 units in both China and international markets as of December 31, 2017. Of these, over 270 units were franchised.
East Dawning. East Dawning is a Chinese food QSR brand, primarily located in large coastal cities. There were 10 restaurants as of year-end 2017. This brand is not viewed as a significant growth engine for the Company.
Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the world’s leading QSR brand specializing in Mexican-style food, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and similar items. The Company opened its first Taco Bell restaurant in Shanghai, China, in December 2016. As of December 31, 2017, there were three Taco Bell restaurants in China.
Daojia. During the second quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in Daojia. We agreed to pay cash consideration of $36.7 million to the sellers and made a concurrent capital contribution of $25.0 million to Daojia. As of the completion of the acquisition, we held 90% of Daojia’s outstanding shares of common stock, or 80% of its equity interests on a fully-diluted basis. Founded in 2010, Daojia focuses on the higher-end delivery market segment, and also operates Sherpa’s, a premium food delivery platform specializing in English speaking services.
Reportable Segments 
 
Beginning with the quarter ended May 31, 2017, the Pizza Hut businesses were combined and reported together as the Pizza Hut reportable segment. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, we have two reportable segments: KFC, which remains unchanged, and Pizza Hut. We also have four other operating segments consisting of the operations of East Dawning, Little Sheep, Taco Bell and Daojia, which are combined and referred to as All Other Segments, as these operating segments are insignificant both individually and in the aggregate. Segment financial information for prior years has been recast to align with this change in segment reporting. There was no impact to the consolidated and combined financial statements of the Company as a result of this change.
 
The following table presents the total segment revenue attributable to each reportable segment for each of the last three years.
 
 
 | Revenues ($ Billions) | 
-------------------+-----------------------+----
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
KFC | | 5.0 | | 4.7 | | 4.8

Our Strategies
 
The Company’s primary strategy is to grow sales and profits across its portfolio of brands through increased brand relevance, new store development and enhanced unit economics. Other areas of investment include store remodels, product innovation and quality, improved operating platforms leading to improved service, store-level human resources including recruiting and training, creative marketing programs and product testing.
 
New-Unit Growth
 
Rapidly growing consumer class. Given the rapidly expanding middle class, we believe that there is significant opportunity to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new markets. We expanded our restaurant count from 5,726 units in 2012 to 7,983 units as of the end of 2017, representing a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 7%.
 
Development pipeline. We consider our development pipeline to be robust, and believe we have an opportunity to grow three times of our restaurant count at the separation over the next two to three decades, including by expanding Taco Bell restaurants and other concepts. We are also keen on exploring various new store formats to support further store expansion, including different store designs or service models aimed at addressing the needs of different customers and occasions. For additional information on the risks associated with this growth strategy, see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We may not attain our target development goals; aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales; and new restaurants may not be profitable.” 
 
Franchise opportunity. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our restaurants were operated by franchisees. We anticipate high franchisee demand for our brands, supported by strong unit economics, operational consistency and simplicity, and multiple store formats to drive restaurant growth. While the franchise market in China is still in its early stages compared to developed markets, the Company plans to continue to increase its franchisee-owned store percentage over time.
 
Same-Store Sales Growth
 
Food innovation. We are keenly aware of the strength of our core menu items but we also seek to continue to introduce innovative items to meet evolving consumer preferences and local tastes, while simultaneously maintaining brand relevance and broadening brand appeal. For example, in 2017 KFC introduced new products, such as rice rolls and shrimp and scallop congee for breakfast, and new products such as avocado burger and chicken coated with Lays ChipsTM in other dayparts. For Pizza Hut, we also launched new products such as Italian thin crust pizza in higher tier cities, crayfish pizza, a new snack platter and jumbo fruit tea.
 
Value innovation. KFC plans to continue to focus on value with product offerings such as the bucket and increased combo options throughout the day. Pizza Hut expects to leverage past innovations like business lunch set and breakfast to drive growth. In addition, Pizza Hut has been making investments in product upgrades such as upgrading the size and offering premium ingredients.
 
Daypart opportunities. We believe there are significant daypart opportunities across our brands. For example, KFC introduced premium coffee to expand its breakfast and afternoon dayparts, and Pizza Hut has focused on breakfast and business lunch to further grow same-store sales.

Best in-store experience. The Company continuously looks for ways to improve the customer experience. For example, with continued investment in refurbishing our restaurants, over 75% of KFC’s store portfolio as of December 31, 2017 has been remodeled or built in the past five years. Pizza Hut is also well-regarded for offering consumers a contemporary casual dining setting. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For example, we have simplified menus and fine-tuned our digital menu boards and in-store self-service order devices. We are also exploring expansion of our delivery business through our own smartphone applications, increased collaboration with O2O (Online to Offline) firms (known as aggregators), and pre-order services.
Digital. KFC rolled out its loyalty program in 2015 to enable customers with a fully digitized experience. The brand also plans to improve the customer experience through ease of ordering and speed of service, supported by innovative technology. Pizza Hut launched loyalty program in late 2016 and launched smartphone application (Super App) in July 2017 and is a leader in providing a digital experience including free in-store Wi-Fi, queue ticketing, and mobile payments. As of December 31, 2017, our loyalty programs have over 110 million members and over 35 million members for KFC and Pizza Hut, respectively. In addition, mobile payments accounted for about 53% of Company sales during the fourth quarter of 2017.
Delivery. China is a world leader in the emerging O2O market. This is where digital online ordering technologies interact with traditional brick and mortar retail to enhance the shopping experience. We see considerable further growth potential in the in-home consumption market by aligning our proven restaurant operation capabilities with emerging specialized O2O firms, or aggregators, that offer consumers the ability to order any restaurant food at home. Pizza Hut and KFC started partnering with aggregators in 2015. These aggregators include our restaurants in their mobile or online platforms and we generate revenue when orders placed through their platforms are delivered to the customers. We use our own staff, including outsourced riders, to deliver orders placed through aggregators’ platforms to customers of KFC and certain Pizza Hut stores, while we use the aggregators’ delivery services, for which we pay a commission, for the majority of Pizza Hut orders. For orders that are placed through these platforms, customers make payments to the aggregators through either mobile payment applications, such as WeChat and Alipay, which are managed by third-party payment processors, or cash upon delivery. For transactions with payments collected by the aggregators from customers, the aggregators settle the amount with third-party payment processors and remit the proceeds to the restaurants generally within a few business days, with limited exceptions. During the second quarter of 2017, we acquired a controlling interest in Daojia to supplement our delivery business. In 2017, approximately 14% of the Company sales were generated from delivery. This could be an exciting new business opportunity with potential to create substantial stockholder value. 
Enhanced Profitability
 
We focus on improving our unit-level economics and overall profits while also making the necessary investments to support our future growth. Restaurant margins improved over four percentage points from 2015 to 2017. This increase was due to our focus on improving productivity and efficiency and was aided by the retail tax structure reform. See “Regulations Relating to Taxation” for details. We plan to pursue additional opportunities to improve profits over the long term by continuing our focus on fiscal discipline and leveraging fixed costs, while maintaining the quality customer experience for which our brands are known.
Franchise and New Business Development
 
The franchise programs of the Company are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchisees. Franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to the Company and by purchasing or leasing the land use right, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies; and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business through expansion. As of December 31, 2017, franchisees owned and operated about 10% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to the Company’s revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales.

 2017 Form 10-K


The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisees and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards and management techniques.
Restaurant Operations
 
Restaurant management structure varies among our brands and by unit size. Generally, each restaurant operated by the Company is led by a Restaurant General Manager (“RGM”), together with one or more Assistant Managers. RGMs are skilled and highly trained, with most having a college-level education. Each brand issues detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. The performance of RGMs is regularly monitored and coached by Area Managers. In addition, senior operations leaders regularly visit restaurants to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant teams.
Supply and Distribution
 
The Company’s restaurants, including those operated by franchisees, are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products and paper and packaging materials. The Company has not experienced any significant, continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate. When prices increase, the brands may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done practically.
 
The Company partners with approximately 800 independent suppliers, mostly China-based, providing a wide range of products. The Company, along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors, utilizes 17 logistics centers and two consolidation centers to distribute restaurant products to owned and franchised stores. The Company also owns a seasoning facility in Inner Mongolia, which supplies products to the Little Sheep business, as well as to third-party customers.
 
Prior to August 2016, all restaurants that operated the Company’s concepts, including those owned by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates, entered into purchase agreements with each of our approved third-party suppliers for raw materials with agreed pricing guidelines applicable to all entities. To improve efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement process, in August 2016, the Company adopted a central procurement model whereby the Company centrally purchases substantially all food and paper products from approved suppliers for most of the restaurants regardless of ownership and then onward sells and delivers them to most of the legal entities, including franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates, that operate the Company’s restaurants. The Company believes this central procurement model allows the Company to maintain quality control and achieves better prices and terms through volume purchases. Under the central procurement model, the materials purchased from various suppliers are intended to be sold to most of the legal entities on a cost-plus basis. The ordering process remains the same under the central procurement model except that the legal title of all materials is initially under the Company instead of the other legal entities.

Food safety is the top priority at the Company. Food safety systems include rigorous standards and training of employees in our restaurants and distribution system, as well as requirements for suppliers. These standards and training topics include, but are not limited to, employee health, product handling, ingredient and product temperature management and prevention of cross contamination. Food safety training is focused on illness prevention, food safety and regulation adherence in day-to-day operations. Our standards also promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations when building new or renovating existing restaurants. For further information on food safety issues, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Food safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business”.
Trademarks and Patents
 
The Company’s use of certain material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between YRAPL and YCCL. The Company is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. The term of the license is 50 years with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to YCCL being in “good standing” and unless YCCL gives notice of its intent not to renew.
 
The Company’s use of certain other material intellectual property (including intellectual property in product recipes, restaurant operation and restaurant design) is likewise governed by the master license agreement with YRAPL.
 
The Company owns registered trademarks and service marks relating to the East Dawning and Little Sheep brands. Collectively, these licensed and owned marks have significant value and are important to the Company’s business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of our important intellectual property rights whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our rights.
 
Working Capital
 
Information about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7. and the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.
Seasonality
 
Due to the nature of our operations, the Company typically generates higher sales during Chinese festivities, holiday seasons as well as summer months, but relatively lower sales and lower operating profit during the second and fourth quarters. 
Competition
 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China indicates that sales in the consumer food service market in China totaled approximately $600 billion in 2017. Industry conditions vary by region, with local Chinese restaurants and Western chains present, but the Company possesses the largest market share (as measured by both units and system sales). On average, competition in China is less intense compared to the United States, and branded QSR units per population are well below that of the United States. However, competition is increasing, and the Company still competes with respect to food quality, price, service, convenience, restaurant location and concept. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and disposable income. The Company competes not only for consumers but also for management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. Among KFC’s primary competitors in China are restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and Dicos. Pizza Hut’s Western pizza-brand competitors include Domino’s and Papa John’s.

Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
The Company operates a test kitchen in Shanghai, China to promote product innovation. From time to time, the Company also works with independent suppliers to conduct R&D activities for the benefit of the Company. The Company expensed $5 million in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 for R&D activities. 
Government Regulations
 
The Company is subject to various laws affecting its business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, labor, health, sanitation and safety. Each of the concepts’ restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include restaurant operation, health, sanitation, food safety, environmental protection and fire agencies in the province and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The Company has not historically been materially adversely affected by such licensing and regulation or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals. The Company is also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and corruption laws. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, provincial, local and international governmental regulation of our business.
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution
 
The Chinese laws, rules and regulations applicable to our China subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations. In addition, under Chinese law, an enterprise incorporated in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. As a result, our China subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. At the discretion of their board of directors, as enterprises incorporated in China, our China subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on China accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax. Under the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, a China resident enterprise is subject to Chinese enterprise income tax in respect of its net taxable income derived from sources inside and outside China. The term “resident enterprise” refers to any enterprise established in China and any enterprise established outside China with a “de facto management body” within China.
 
Our China subsidiaries are regarded as China resident enterprises by virtue of their incorporation in China, and are generally subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on their worldwide income at the current uniform rate of 25%, unless reduced under certain specific qualifying criteria. Our China subsidiaries may deduct reasonable expenses that are actually incurred and are related to the generation of their income, including interest and other borrowing expenses, amortization of land use rights and depreciation of buildings and certain fixed assets, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed under the EIT Law, its implementation regulations and any applicable tax notices and circulars issued by the Chinese government or tax authorities.

 2017 Form 10-K


Yum China and each subsidiary of Yum China that is organized outside of China intends to conduct its management functions in a manner that does not cause it to be a China resident enterprise, including by carrying on its day-to-day management activities and maintaining its key records, such as resolutions of its board of directors and resolutions of stockholders, outside of China. As such, we do not believe that Yum China or any of its non-Chinese subsidiaries should be considered a China resident enterprise for purposes of the EIT Law, and should not be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on that basis. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Under the EIT Law, if we are classified as a China resident enterprise for Chinese enterprise income tax purposes, such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-Chinese stockholders.”
Value-Added Tax / Business Tax and Local Surcharges. Effective on May 1, 2016, a 6% value-added tax (“VAT”) on output replaced the 5% business tax (“BT”) that has historically been applied to certain restaurant sales under the China Provisional Regulations on Business Tax. Pursuant to Circular Caishui [2016] No. 36 jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”), beginning May 1, 2016, any entity engaged in the provision of catering services in China is generally required to pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of such services, less any creditable VAT already paid or borne by such entity upon purchase of materials and services. Local surcharges generally ranging from 7% to 13%, varying with the location of the relevant China subsidiary, are imposed on the amount of VAT payable. On December 21, 2016, Circular Caishui [2016] No. 140 was jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the SAT, pursuant to which it was confirmed that an entity engaged in catering services shall pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of take-out food.
Repatriation of Dividends from Our China Subsidiaries. Dividends (if any) paid by our China subsidiaries to their direct offshore parent company are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%, provided that such dividends are not effectively connected with any establishment or place of the offshore parent company in China. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to the provisions of any applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements entered into by China. 
Gains on Direct Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, gains derived by non-resident enterprises from the sale of equity interests in a China resident enterprise are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. The gains are computed based on the difference between the sales proceeds and the original investment basis. Stamp duty is also payable upon a direct transfer of equity interest in a China resident enterprise. The stamp duty is calculated at 0.05% on the transfer value, payable by each of the transferor and transferee. We may be subject to these taxes in the event of any future sale by us of a China resident enterprise.

 2017 Form 10-K


Gains on Indirect Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. In February 2015, the SAT issued the SAT’s Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (“Bulletin 7”). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (“Chinese interests”), by a non-resident enterprise, may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor avoids payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” of Chinese interests by disposing of equity interests in an offshore holding company, the transferor, transferee and/or the China resident enterprise being indirectly transferred may report such indirect transfer to the relevant Chinese tax authority, which may in turn report upward to the SAT. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the SAT may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer avoids Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes may be subject to penalties under Chinese tax laws if the transferor fails to pay the taxes and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes fails to withhold the taxes.
 
The above regulations do not apply if either (i) the selling non-resident enterprise recognizes the relevant gain by purchasing and selling equity of the same listed enterprise in the open market (the “listed enterprise exception”); or (ii) the selling non-resident enterprise would have been exempted from enterprise income tax in China pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements, if it had directly held and transferred such Chinese interests that were indirectly transferred. Under current law, the China indirect transfer rules do not apply to gains recognized by individual stockholders, regardless of whether or not they acquire or transfer our stock in open market transactions. However, in practice, there have been a few reported cases of individuals being taxed on the indirect transfer of Chinese interests and the law could be changed so as to apply to individual stockholders, possibly with retroactive effect.
 
It is unclear whether Company stockholders that acquired Yum China stock through the distribution will be treated as acquiring Yum China stock in an open market purchase. If such acquisition of Yum China stock is not treated as acquired in an open market purchase, the listed transaction exception will not be available for transfers of such stock. We expect that transfers in open market transactions of our stock by corporate or other non-individual stockholders that have purchased our stock in open market transactions will not be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules due to the listed enterprise exception. Transfers, whether in the open market or otherwise, of our stock by corporate and other non-individual stockholders that acquired our stock in the distribution or in non-open market transactions may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant Chinese tax authorities. Transfers of our stock in non-open market transactions by corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules, whether or not such stock was acquired in open market transactions, and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant China tax authorities.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which included a broad range of tax reforms, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a flat corporate income tax rate of 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain business deductions, and the imposition of tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Act has impacted Yum China in two material aspects: all of the foreign-source dividends received by Yum China from its foreign subsidiaries will be exempted from taxation starting from tax year beginning after December 31, 2017 and Yum China recorded additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, including an estimated one-time transition tax on its deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and additional tax related to revaluation of certain deferred tax assets. 
 
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not exceeding one year from the enactment date. The Tax Act requires complex computations with significant estimates to be performed, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our current interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period not exceeding one year from the enactment date in accordance with SAB 118.
 
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation relating to taxation of our business.
