Overview
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics. We have used our expertise in biology and tetracycline chemistry to create chemically diverse and biologically distinct small molecules derived from the minocycline core structure. Our United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved commercial product, NUZYRATM (omadacycline) is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and acute skin and skin structure infections, or ABSSSI, caused by susceptible pathogens. Paratek is also studying NUZYRA for the treatment of urinary tract infections, or UTI. SEYSARA™ (sarecycline) is an FDA-approved product with respect to which we have exclusively licensed in the United States certain rights to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall. SEYSARA is currently being marketed by Almirall in the United States, or U.S., as a new once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Paratek retains development and commercialization rights with respect to sarecycline in the rest of the world.
NUZYRA
 We believe that NUZYRA has the potential to become the primary choice of physicians for use as a broad-spectrum monotherapy antibiotic for ABSSSI, CABP, UTI and other serious community-acquired bacterial infections, where resistance is of concern.  We believe NUZYRA will be used in the emergency room, hospital and community care settings. We have designed NUZYRA to provide potential advantages over existing antibiotics, including activity against resistant bacteria, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, oral and IV formulations with once-daily dosing, no dosing adjustments for patients on concomitant medications and a generally safe and well tolerated profile.

To date, we have conducted more than 20 Phase 1 studies of omadacycline to characterize the effects of the drug on humans, including how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. These Phase 1 studies also included evaluation in special populations like hepatic and renal failure patients. We have also conducted three successful Phase 3 clinical studies. Our first two Phase 3 clinical studies were for the treatment of ABSSSI (OASIS-1) and CABP (OPTIC). Both studies utilized initiation of IV therapy with transitions to oral-based treatment on clinical response. Our third Phase 3 clinical study (OASIS-2) was an oral-only administration of omadacycline in ABSSSI compared to oral-only linezolid. All three Phase 3 clinical studies resulted in omadacycline demonstrating positive efficacy results and a generally safe and well tolerated profile.  These data formed the basis of approval for NUZYRA in the United States.  In October 2018, we also submitted these data in the Market Authorization Applications, or MAA, submission to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA.
Scientific advice received through the centralized procedure in Europe confirmed general agreement on the design and choice of comparators of the Phase 3 clinical program for ABSSSI and CABP and noted that approval based on a single study in each indication could be possible but would be subject to more stringent statistical standards than MAA programs that conduct two pivotal Phase 3 studies per indication. We believe that the inclusion of the second Phase 3 oral-only study in ABSSSI strengthens the data package for submission of an MAA filing for approval in European Union, or EU.  
 Based on the body of evidence and the activity of omadacycline against UTI pathogens, we initiated two Phase 2 clinical studies evaluating omadacycline for the treatment of UTI. The first study was initiated in December 2017 to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of omadacycline in female patients with cystitis, a common uncomplicated UTI. The second study was initiated in November 2018 to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of omadacycline in patients with acute pyelonephritis, a common complicated UTI. The results of the Phase 2 UTI program are expected in the second half of 2019.
 In October 2016, we announced that we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to study omadacycline against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance. These studies are designed to confirm humanized dosing regimens of omadacycline in order to study the efficacy of omadacycline against biodefense pathogens, including Yersinia pestis, or plague, and Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax. Funding support for the trial has been made available through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA/ Joint Science and Technology Office and Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense / Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems / BioDefense Therapeutics.
 Sarecycline
 Sarecycline, also known as SEYSARA in the United States, is a new, once-daily, tetracycline-derived compound designed for use in the treatment of acne and rosacea. We believe that, based upon the data generated to-date, sarecycline possesses favorable anti-inflammatory activity, narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity relative to other tetracycline-derived molecules, oral bioavailability, inability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We believe that these qualities make sarecycline particularly well-suited for the treatment of inflammatory acne in the community setting. We have exclusively licensed U.S. development and commercialization rights to sarecycline for the treatment of acne to Allergan plc, or Allergan, who assigned such rights to Almirall, in August 2018. SEYSARA was approved by the FDA in October 2018 for the treatment of severe non-nodular inflammatory acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older.  Almirall launched SEYSARA in the United States in January 2019. We retain development and commercialization rights with respect to sarecycline in the rest of the world.
 Almirall currently holds a nonexclusive license to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of rosacea in the United States.

The Antibiotics Market and Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics to treat patients with acute and chronic infectious diseases that are either known, or presumed, to be caused by bacteria. The World Health Organization has identified the development of worldwide resistance to currently available antibacterial agents as being one of the three greatest threats to human health in this decade. In a press release announcing the release of a study titled “Hospital and Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistant Infections in a Chicago Teaching Hospital: Implications for Antibiotic Stewardship,” it was estimated that antibiotic-resistant infections cost the U.S. healthcare system in excess of $20 billion annually. In addition, these infections result in more than $35 billion in societal costs and more than 8 million additional days spent in the hospital. Historically, the majority of life-threatening infections resulting from antibiotic-resistant bacteria were acquired in the hospital setting. According to AMR data from 2015 projected to 2028, approximately 6.7 million antibiotic treated events occur annually in the two combined indications of ABSSSI and CABP in U.S. hospitals. Furthermore, research conducted by Paratek suggests that in these same indications of ABSSSI and CABP there are approximately 890 thousand patients treated in U.S hospitals who fail to respond or are intolerant to the existing generic options. In the U.S. community setting, IMS NDTI data (2014-2015) projected to 2028 suggests there are approximately 23.7 million prescriptions for ABSSSI and CABP. Additionally, research conducted by Paratek suggests that approximately 2.1 million patients fail to respond or are intolerant to the existing oral generics in the U.S. community setting. The emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, coupled with limitations in terms of intolerance to existing generic options, emphasizes the need for novel agents capable of overcoming antibiotic resistance.
 Bacteria are often broadly classified as gram-positive bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, and multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, or MDR-SP; gram-negative bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, or ESBL, producing Enterobacteriaceae; atypical bacteria, including Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila; and anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides and Clostridia. Antibiotics that are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are referred to as “broad-spectrum”, while antibiotics that are active only against a select subset of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria are referred to as “narrow spectrum”. Today, because many of the currently prescribed antibiotics that have activity against resistant organisms typically are “narrow spectrum,” they cannot be used as an empiric monotherapy treatment of serious infections where gram-negative, atypical or anaerobic bacteria may also be involved. Empiric monotherapy refers to the use of a single, antibacterial agent to begin treatment of an infection before the specific pathogen causing the infection has been identified. We believe omadacycline will be used in the emergency room, hospital and community care settings.  Based on studies published by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and American Academy of Family Physicians, rates of infections involving organisms other than gram-positive bacteria have been found to be as much as 15% in ABSSSI, up to 40% in CABP and 70% to 90% in UTI.
 When a patient goes to the emergency room or hospital for treatment of a serious infection, the physician’s selection of which IV antibiotic to use is often based on the severity of infection, the pathogen(s) believed most likely to be involved and the probability of a resistant pathogen(s) being present. After initial IV therapy and once the infection begins to respond to treatment, hospitals and physicians face strong pressures to discharge patients from the hospital to reduce costs, limit hospital-acquired infections and improve the patient’s quality of life. In order to transition patients out of the hospital and home to complete the course of therapy, physicians typically prefer to have the option to prescribe a bioequivalent oral formulation of the same antibiotic.
 Antibiotics used to treat ABSSSI, CABP, UTI and other serious, community-acquired bacterial infections must satisfy a wide range of criteria on a cost-effective basis. For example, we believe that existing treatment options for ABSSSI, including vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, piperacillin tazobactam, oritavancin, dalbavancin, tigecycline and delafloxacin; for CABP, including levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, ceftaroline and tigecycline; and for UTI, including levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, have one or more of the following significant limitations:
  
• | Limited spectrum of antibacterial activity. Since it may take as long as 48 to 72 hours to identify the pathogen(s) causing an infection and most of the currently available options that cover resistant pathogens are narrow-spectrum treatments, physicians frequently prescribe two or more antibiotics to treat a broad-spectrum of potential pathogens. For example, vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin, the most frequently prescribed treatments for certain serious bacterial skin infections, are narrow-spectrum treatments active only against gram-positive bacteria. The currently available treatment with a more appropriate spectrum for use as a monotherapy against serious and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections is tigecycline, but it has other significant limitations, most notably dose limiting tolerability of nausea and vomiting.

• | Lack of both oral and IV formulations. The most common treatments for serious bacterial infections, vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin tazobactam, and tigecycline are only available as injectable or IV formulations. The lack of an effective bioequivalent oral formulation of these and many other commonly prescribed antibiotics requires continued IV therapy, which is inconvenient for the patient and may result in longer hospital stays and greater cost. Alternatively, because of the absence of the same antibiotic in an oral, well-tolerated formulation, physicians may switch the patient to a different orally available antibiotic at the time of hospital discharge. This carries the risk of new side effects and possible treatment failure if the oral antibiotic does not cover the same bacteria that were being effectively treated by the IV antibiotic therapy. While linezolid is a twice-daily IV and oral therapy, it is a narrow-spectrum treatment that is associated with increasing bacterial resistance, side effects from interactions with other therapies and other serious safety concerns.

• | Safety/tolerability concerns and side effects. Concerns about antibiotic safety and tolerability are among the leading reasons why patients stop treatment and fail therapy. The most commonly used antibiotics, such as vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, azithromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and tigecycline, are associated with safety and tolerability concerns. For example, vancomycin, which requires frequent therapeutic monitoring of blood levels and corresponding dose adjustments, is associated with allergic reactions and can cause kidney damage, loss of balance, loss of hearing, vomiting and nausea in certain patients. Linezolid is associated with bone marrow suppression and loss of vision and should not be taken by patients who are also on many commonly prescribed anti-depressants, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Daptomycin has been associated with a reduction of efficacy in patients with moderate renal insufficiency and has a side effect profile that includes muscle damage. Piperacillin/tazobactam is not used in patients with beta-lactam (penicillin) allergy while tigecycline is associated with tolerability concerns because of nausea and vomiting. Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are associated with tendon rupture and peripheral neuropathy. In July 2016, the FDA approved changes to the labels of fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for systemic use (i.e., taken by mouth or by injection), stating “These medicines are associated with disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system that can occur together in the same patient.” As a result, the FDA revised the Boxed Warning, FDA’s strongest warning, to address these serious safety issues. They also added a new warning and updated other parts of the drug label, including the patient Medication Guide. Additionally, a May 2012 article in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that a small number of patients treated with azithromycin and quinolones, such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, may experience sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia, which is often predicted by a prolongation of the corrected QT interval, or QTc. The FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication on March 12, 2013 titled “Azithromycin (Zithromax or Zmax) and the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythms,” and the azithromycin drug label warnings were strengthened to address this concern.

• | Increasing bacterial resistance. Bacterial resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics (branded or generic) has limited their potential to treat infections, which often prevents their use as an empiric monotherapy. We believe that MRSA and MDR-SP, in the community have posed treatment challenges because of resistance to penicillins (resistance rate up to 100% for both), cephalosporins (100% and 11%, respectively, for ceftriaxone), macrolides (83% and 86%, respectively, for erythromycin/azithromycin) and quinolones (73% and 2%, respectively, for levofloxacin), particularly in ABSSSI and CABP. There have also been recent reports of resistance developing during treatment with daptomycin and concerns about an increasing frequency of strains of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Additionally, linezolid use has been associated with drug resistance, including reports of outbreaks of resistance among Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus strains. The increasing occurrence of multi-drug resistant, ESBL-producing, gram-negative bacteria in community-acquired UTIs has severely curtailed the oral antibiotic treatment options available to physicians for these UTIs. For example, in a recent survey, 95% and 76% of the ESBL isolates of Escherichia coli found in UTIs were resistant to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These limitations can ultimately lead to longer hospital stays, greater healthcare costs and increased morbidity and mortality due to lower cure rates and additional side effects. While certain antibiotics address some of these outcomes, we do not believe there is one superior treatment option that satisfies all outcomes. We believe that it is essential for the treatment of patients with serious, community-acquired bacterial infections that physicians prescribe the right antibiotic the first time, as ineffective antibiotics can quickly lead to progressively more severe and invasive infections or even death.

• | Equivalent Once-daily oral and IV formulations to support transition therapy. We have studied once-daily IV and oral formulations of omadacycline in approximately 1,900 subjects to-date across multiple Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The equivalent exposures of the oral and IV formulations permit transition therapy, which could allow patients to start treatment on the IV formulation in the hospital setting then “transition” to the oral formulation of the same bioequivalent antibacterial agent once the infection is responding enabling the patient to be released from the hospital to complete the full course of therapy at home. We believe that transition therapy has the potential to avoid the concerns that can accompany switching from an IV agent to a different class of oral antibiotic and to facilitate the continuance of curative therapy at home.

• | Broad-spectrum of antibacterial activity. Omadacycline has demonstrated in vitro activity against all common pathogens found in ABSSSI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, Streptococci (including Group A Streptococci), anaerobic pathogens and many gram-negative organisms. Omadacycline is also active in vitro against the key pathogens found in CABP, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, including MDR-SP, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and atypical bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila. On the basis of the in vitro spectrum of activity demonstrated by omadacycline against a range of pathogens in our pre-clinical testing, we believe omadacycline has the in vitro spectrum of coverage needed to potentially become the primary antibiotic choice of physicians and serve as an empiric monotherapy option for ABSSSI and CABP where resistance is of concern.

• | Generally safe and well tolerated profile. To date, we have observed omadacycline to be generally well tolerated in studies involving approximately 1,900 subjects. We have conducted a thorough QTc study, as defined by FDA guidance to assess prolongation of QTc, an indicator of cardiac arrhythmia. This study suggests no prolongation of QTc by omadacycline at three times the therapeutic exposure. In addition, phase 3 clinical studies support that lack of cardiovascular effects associated with omadacycline. There have been no Adverse Events, or AEs, of ventricular arrhythmia, QT prolongation, seizures, syncope, or sudden death in the completed studies. Further, in clinical studies, omadacycline does not appear to adversely affect blood cell production, nor does it appear to metabolize in the liver or anywhere else in the body, thus reducing the likelihood of causing drug-to-drug interactions. Additionally, omadacycline has resulted in low rates of diarrhea, and we have not observed confirmed cases of Clostridium difficile infection, which can frequently occur from the use of other classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as beta-lactams and quinolones.

• | Designed to overcome bacterial resistance. We designed omadacycline to overcome the two major mechanisms of tetracycline resistance, known as pump efflux and ribosome protection. This approach was via structure-activity relationship chemistry-based modifications of the seven and nine positions of minocycline. Our attempts to generate resistance to omadacycline in the laboratory suggest a low potential for developing resistance. In addition, our testing of thousands of bacterial samples in the laboratory suggests that omadacycline has not been affected to date by clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to tetracyclines or to any other class of antibiotics.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tissue penetration. Omadacycline appears to penetrate tissues broadly, including lung, muscle, and kidney, thereby achieving high concentrations at the sites of infection. Since omadacycline is eliminated from the body (as unchanged parent compound) via the kidneys and intestine in an expected manner, based on the results of our Phase 1 studies, we believe it may potentially be used in patients with diminished kidney and liver function, without dose adjustment, and may potentially have benefit in patients receiving poly-pharmacy, where drug-drug interactions are of concern. We have completed pre-clinical work evaluating omadacycline for the potential treatment of sinusitis, also known as an acute sinus infection or rhinosinusitis. In addition, we have completed a proof-of-principle study in females with uncomplicated UTI, given the high percentage of renal elimination and urinary concentrations, omadacycline may have utility as a treatment option for patients with UTI infections.

Phase 1 Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Omadacycline in Female Adults with Cystitis (uncomplicated UTI):
 Study Design. The primary objectives were to evaluate the urine and plasma concentrations of omadacycline.  The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omadacycline in female adults with cystitis.  This study was a randomized (1:1:1), open-label, parallel-designed Phase 1b study evaluating three dosing regimens of omadacycline in the treatment of female adults with cystitis. Following a Screening period of up to 48 hours, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups and received dosing regimens of omadacycline.  Dosing was as follows:

Dose Time | Study Day | | Group 1 omadacycline IV Load, Oral Daily | | | Group 2 omadacycline Oral Load, Oral Daily | | Group 3 omadacycline High oral Load, High oral Daily
----------+-----------+---+------------------------------------------+-----------+---+--------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------
t = 0 h | | 1 | | 200 mg iv | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po
t = 12 h | | 1 | | | — | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po
t = 24 h | | 2 | | 300 mg po | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po
t = 48 h | | 3 | | 300 mg po | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po
t = 72 h | | 4 | | 300 mg po | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po
t = 96 h | | 5 | | 300 mg po | | | 300 mg po | | 450 mg po

 
Study Results. Overall, 31 subjects (11 in Group 1 and 10 in each of Groups 2 and 3) were randomized and received the study drug at three study sites. All but one subject completed the intended five days of study treatment (1 subject in Group 1 withdrew consent). Subjects were females and they ranged in age from 19 to 75 years (mean 42 years overall).  Plasma PK results on Day 1 showed the highest omadacycline exposure following the 200-mg IV dose in Group 1 (geometric mean AUC0-24 15557 h*ng/mL). The Day 1 geometric mean AUC0-12 value for Group 2 was 6152 h*ng/mL (following the first 300 mg po dose) and, for Group 3, the value was 6686 h*ng/mL (following the first 450 mg po dose). By Day 5 the geometric mean AUC0-24 values for Groups 1 and 2 were 9555 h*ng/mL and 12375 h*ng/mL, respectively following 300 mg po doses, and for Group 3 the value was 18693 h*ng/mL following the 450 mg po dose.  At steady state (Day 5), the geometric mean cumulative amount of drug excreted in urine from time t0 to t24 (Ae0-24) values for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 21.72 mg, 31.46 mg, and 43.60 mg, respectively. Relative to the absorbed amount of omadacycline, this corresponds to geometric mean fraction of the dose excreted unchanged in urine from 0 to 24 hours after dosing (Fe0-24) for Groups 1, 2, and 3 on Day 5 of 20.7%, 30.0%, and 27.7%, respectively. The highest mean omadacycline urine concentration value (65360 ng/mL [65.4 µg/mL]) was observed in Group 1 over 0 to 4 hours after the 200 mg IV dose on Day 1. The mean values across all other intervals/Groups ranged from 11699 to 48117 ng/mL (i.e., 11.7 to 48.1 µg/mL).  The most common Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, in all groups were gastrointestinal, most notably nausea (60% to 73% per group) and vomiting (20% to 40% per group), all of which were of mild or moderate intensity. No subjects in the study discontinued study treatment because of these TEAEs. No subjects in this study experienced severe TEAEs or serious adverse events, leading to premature discontinuation of the study drug.

Study Conclusions. Omadacycline is partially excreted in urine in adult female subjects with cystitis. With the treatment regimens studied, observed urine concentrations of omadacycline compared favorably with minimum inhibitory concentration values for common UTI pathogens, and a high percentage of subjects achieved clinical success and favorable microbiological response. There was a higher than expected incidence of gastrointestinal, or GI, TEAEs (particularly nausea and vomiting), which contrasts with the notably lower rates of nausea and vomiting observed in other clinical studies using comparable dosing regimens. Omadacycline may be a useful treatment for certain UTIs and warrants evaluation in larger controlled studies, with continued close monitoring of GI tolerability.  
 Based on the above data results, we have initiated two Phase 2 clinical studies evaluating omadacycline for the treatment of UTI. The first study, which was initiated in December 2017, will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of omadacycline in female patients with cystitis, a common uncomplicated UTI. The second study, which was initiated in November 2018, will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of omadacycline in patients with acute pyelonephritis, a common complicated UTI. We plan to enroll approximately 200 patients in each study at multiple sites. The results of the Phase 2 UTI program are expected in the second half of 2019.   The following illustration highlights the adaptive design we plan to employ in the cystitis and acute pyelonephritis studies.

Omadacycline Post-Approval Requirements in the United States
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (21 U.S.C. 355c), or PREA, all applications for new active ingredients are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable.  As part of the approval for NUZYRA, the FDA has waived the pediatric study requirement for ages 0 to < 8 years and deferred submission of pediatric studies for ages 8 to < 18 years.  Specifically, the FDA has requested that we develop an age appropriate formulation, and complete three pediatric studies, including a pediatric PK study followed by safety and efficacy studies in pediatric patients with both CABP and ABSSSI.  In addition to pediatric requirements, as with all antibiotic approvals, the FDA has also required a U.S. surveillance study for five years from the date of marketing to monitor for the development of resistance to NUZYRA (omadacycline) in those organisms specific to the indications in the label.  Lastly, FDA has required a second study be conducted in patients with CABP.  
 Sarecycline
 Sarecycline, also known as SEYSARA in the United States, is a novel, next generation, narrow spectrum tetracycline designed specifically for dermatological use. We exclusively licensed the U.S. rights to sarecycline for the treatment of acne to Allergan, who assigned such rights to Almirall, and Almirall is responsible for all U.S. development and commercialization costs for this program. In exchange for license rights, we have the right to receive (i) milestone payments upon the achievement of development and regulatory progress, and (ii) a royalty on net sales. We retain development and commercialization rights outside of the United States with respect to sarecycline, which are available for licensing to other partners in key international markets, such as the EU, Japan, the rest of Asia, Canada, and Latin America. 
 Allergan submitted an NDA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe acne. SEYSARA was approved in October 2018 by the FDA for the treatment of severe non-nodular inflammatory acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. Almirall launched SEYSARA in the United States in January 2019. Under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), we have earned the following development and regulatory milestones: a $4.0 million milestone payment for the initiation of the Phase 3 acne vulgaris clinical studies in December 2014, a $5.0 million milestone payment for acceptance by the FDA of Allergan’s NDA for sarecycline in December 2017, and a $12.0 million milestone payment for FDA approval in October 2018. Almirall is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties, ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits, based on net sales of tetracycline compounds developed under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, with a standard royalty reduction post patent expiration for such product for the remainder of the royalty term.
 Almirall currently holds a nonexclusive license to develop and commercialize sarecycline for the treatment of rosacea in the United States. 
 Market
 Both acne and rosacea can be disfiguring conditions with significant social and medical costs. According to IMS sales data, over $3.0 billion was spent on treatments for acne in 2013. In excess of $1.3 billion was spent in 2011 on various oral formulations of doxycycline or minocycline to treat these conditions. Periostat, reformulated doxycycline, and Solodyn, reformulated minocycline, recorded peak sales of approximately $300 million in 2012 and $750 million in 2011, respectively. 
 The most common oral treatments prescribed by dermatologists are generic tetracycline derivatives, which dermatologists widely accept as a therapy for moderate to severe acne post or in conjunction with topical treatment. A common side effect associated with the use of any broad-spectrum oral antibacterial agent is gastrointestinal upset and antibiotic-associated infections caused by the destruction of the normal bacterial flora. In addition, we believe there is a growing concern and awareness of the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from the heavy use of broader-spectrum antibiotics, such as these older-generation tetracyclines, where broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy is not necessary.
 Therefore, we believe there is an unmet need for a narrow spectrum targeted tetracycline specifically designed for dermatologists to treat Acne such as, SEYSARA.
 NUZYRA Commercialization Strategy
 We currently intend to market NUZYRA as an empiric monotherapy that will be commercialized worldwide for the treatment of serious, community-acquired bacterial infections. We retain worldwide commercial rights to omadacycline, with the exception of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, where we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai.  In the United States and Europe, we continue to reserve the right to either commercialize omadacycline alone, through one or more pharmaceutical companies that have established commercial capabilities, or some combination thereof.
 8


In 2018 we entered into an arrangement with a third party to provide a contract field sales force of between 80-85 sales representatives with associated training and other services. In February 2019, we launched NUZYRA with 40 sales representatives calling on approximately 400 hospitals across the United States. By the end of 2019 we are planning to have a full complement of between 80-85 representatives calling on approximately 850 hospitals.
 We believe that there is a similar rapidly growing need in other markets throughout the world, including Europe, established Asian markets such as Japan and Korea, and emerging markets, such as Russia, South America and India. We plan to pursue expansion of omadacycline to these markets through collaboration or distribution arrangements 
 Competition
 Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. We believe that our product candidates offer key potential advantages over competitive products that could enable our product candidates to capture meaningful market share from our competitors.
 NUZYRA competes with other antibiotics in the serious bacterial skin infection market. These include, but are not limited to, vancomycin, marketed as a generic by Abbott Laboratories and others; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; daptomycin, marketed as Cubicin by Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and available as a generic; dalbavancin, marketed as Dalvance by Allergan; tedizolid, marketed as Sivextro by Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; oritavancin, marketed as Orbactiv by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.; quinupristin/dalfopristin, marketed as Synercid by Pfizer, Inc.; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; telavancin, marketed as Vibativ by Theravance, Inc.; ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Allergan; and generic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. 
 Further, we expect that product candidates currently in review with the FDA, in Phase 3 clinical development, or that could enter Phase 3 clinical development in the near future, may represent significant competition if approved. These include, but are not limited to, delafloxacin for CABP, submitted for FDA review in October 2016 by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.; CG-400549, under development by Crystal Genomics; GSK2140944, under development by GSK; nemonoxacin, under development by TaiGen Biotechnology; brilacidin, under development by Cellceutix; and radezolid, under development by Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.
 NUZYRA also competes with other antibiotics in the community-acquired pneumonia market. These include azithromycin, marketed as Zithromax and Z-PAK by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; clarithromycin, marketed as Biaxin by Abbott Laboratories and available as a generic; moxifloxacin, marketed as Avelox by Bayer AG and available as a generic; levofloxacin, marketed as Levaquin by Johnson & Johnson and available as a generic; tigecycline, marketed as Tygacil by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; linezolid, marketed as Zyvox by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic; ceftriaxone, marketed as Rocephin by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and available as a generic; and ceftaroline, marketed as Teflaro by Allergan. We are also aware of various drugs that are or may eventually be under development for the treatment of CABP, delafloxacin and radezolid, under development by Melinta Therapeutics; solithromycin, under development by Melinta.; GSK2140944, under development by GSK; lefamulin, under development by Nabriva Therapeutics and nemanoxacin, under development by TaiGen Biotechnology.
 A number of competitors exist in the potential UTI indication. Generic potential competitors include levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Several branded and generic injectable-only antibiotics are also used in hospitals, including imipenem/cilastatin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin. A limited number of companies are developing new oral antibiotics for the treatment of UTI infections, finafloxacin by MerLion Pharmaceuticals and sulopenem by Iterum Therapeutics.
 Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in marketing products, discovering and developingt product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than our products or any other product candidate we may commercialize and may render our products or product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of our development and commercialization. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products or product candidates non-competitive or obsolete.

Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future.. Our product candidates have to date been organic compounds of low molecular weight, commonly referred to as small molecules. They are manufactured in synthetic processes from starting materials that have to date been generally available. 
 For omadacycline, the manufacturing process has been refined to commercial scale. The active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process is a three-step synthesis followed by purification and salt formation.  The starting material is minocycline, which is a well characterized and readily available. In 2018, we completed three process validation batches each for the IV and oral formulations of omadacycline, which have subsequently been put on stability testing.  We have entered into commercial supply agreements with qualified commercial manufacturing organizations as described below, to manufacture and supply the drug substance, drug product and finished packaged product.
 CIPAN
 In November 2016, we entered into a manufacturing and services agreement with CIPAN – Companhia Industrial Produtora de Antibióticos, or CIPAN. The agreement, as subsequently amended, provides the terms and conditions under which CIPAN will manufacture and supply to us increased quantities of minocycline starting material and crude omadacycline, or the CIPAN Products, for purification into omadacycline and, subsequently, for use in our products that contain omadacycline tosylate as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay a CIPAN Product price in the four-digit U.S. dollar range per kilogram for minocycline starting material and in the four-digit or five-digit U.S. dollar range per kilogram for crude omadacycline, based on the annual volume of crude omadacycline that we order, subject to adjustments as set forth in the agreement. CIPAN will also perform certain services related to development, technology transfer and manufacturing of the CIPAN Products as provided in one or more statements of work, which shall set forth the fees payable by us to CIPAN for such services. 
 Our agreement with CIPAN will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which the agreement will continue, with respect to each CIPAN Product, for successive renewal terms unless either we or CIPAN have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of either the initial or then-current renewal term. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
 Carbogen
 In December 2016, we entered into an outsourcing agreement with CARBOGEN AMCIS AG, or Carbogen. The agreement, as subsequently amended, provides for the terms and conditions under which Carbogen will manufacture and supply to us the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our omadacycline drug products in bulk quantities, or the Carbogen Product. Under this agreement, we are responsible for the cost and supply of crude omadacycline that Carbogen requires to manufacture the Carbogen Products and perform related services. We are obligated to pay Carbogen an amount in the seven-digit U.S. dollar range per batch of Carbogen Product that we order, depending on the size of the campaign, and the price may be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We may also request that Carbogen perform certain services related to the Carbogen Product, for which we will pay reasonable compensation to Carbogen. 
 Our agreement with Carbogen will remain in effect for a fixed initial term and subsequent renewal terms.  Both parties, however, are required to use diligent efforts to replace the existing agreement with a subsequent long-term agreement. We may terminate this agreement by delivering notice of termination to Carbogen prior to the expiration of the initial or subsequent term. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party or the other party’s insolvency. 
 Almac
 In December 2016, we entered into a manufacturing and services agreement with Almac Pharma Services Limited, or Almac. The agreement provides for the terms and conditions under which Almac will manufacture, package and supply to us omadacycline oral solid dosage tablets in bulk form, or the Almac Products. Under this agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to timely provide Almac with the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to manufacture the Almac Products and perform related services. We are obligated to pay a supply price in the five-digit range in Great Britain Pounds per batch of the Almac Products, subject to adjustments as provided in the agreement. We will also negotiate with Almac, as part of each individual scope of work, the reasonable costs for the services to be performed for us by Almac. 
 10


Our agreement with Almac will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which the agreement will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Almac have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of the initial or then-current renewal term. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
 Patheon
 In July 2017, we entered into a master manufacturing services agreement and corresponding product agreement with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon.  The product agreement was amended in January 2019 to reflect exchange rate and pricing updates.  The agreements provide for the terms and conditions under which Patheon will manufacture, package and supply to us, omadacycline in injectable form, or the Patheon Products. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to manufacture the Patheon Products. We are obligated to pay a supply price in the six-digit dollar range per batch of the Patheon Products, subject to adjustments as provided in the agreements. Now that our omadacycline product has been approved, we are also subject to an annual minimum purchase requirement in the six-digit U.S. dollar range. If we desire for Patheon to conduct additional services other than those expressly set forth in the agreements, those would be subject to additional fees. 
 Our agreements with Patheon will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which they will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon have given written notice of termination within a certain period prior to the expiration of the applicable initial or then-current renewal term. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency.
 Research and Development
 We have and will continue to make substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses totaled $57.5 million and $60.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical studies and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our proprietary drug development platform, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for areas such as composition of matter and the chemistries that allow for the synthesis of novel, substituted tetracycline compounds that exhibit significant antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory activity, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our proprietary technologies and compounds, our current product and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products and technology depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio of owned or exclusively licensed patents and applications includes 68 issued U.S. patents, 23 pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart patents or applications. We expect that the patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other government fees are paid, would expire between 2020 and 2038, excluding any additional terms from patent term adjustments or patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
 11


NUZYRA (omadacycline)
 The patent portfolio for omadacycline is directed to cover compositions of matter, formulations, salts and polymorphs, manufacturing methods, methods of use, dosing regimens, and modes of administration. The patents and patent applications covering omadacycline include patents and patent applications owned by us. In some corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, omadacycline is covered along with other compounds in patents and patent applications that are owned jointly by us and Tufts University, or Tufts, that are subject to a license agreement we have with Tufts. The issued composition of matter patent in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 7,553,828), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, was expected to expire in 2023, however, we believe that additional term  for certain omadacycline patents may result from the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, including the composition of matter patent which is anticipated to be extended until May 2028 and a method of use patent (U.S. 9,265,740) is expected to be extended until October 2030. Filings for both patent term extensions have been made with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.  Omadacycline has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act. This may provide up to an additional five years of market exclusivity layered with protection provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which GAIN also enables exclusivity to 2028. We expect that the other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, would expire between 2021 and 2038, excluding any additional terms from patent term adjustments or patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
 SEYSARA (sarecycline)
 The patent portfolio for our acne and rosacea program is directed to cover compositions of matter, methods of use, as well as salts and polymorphs of sarecycline. As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio includes issued U.S. Patent No. 8,318,706, or the ‘706 Patent, which covers composition of matter of sarecycline and issued U.S. Patent No. 8,513,223, or the ‘223 Patent, which covers methods of use for sarecycline, and corresponding foreign national or regional counterpart applications. The ‘706 Patent is expected to expire in 2032 (this expiry taking into account the expected patent term extension as provided by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) and the ‘223 Patent is expected to expire in 2029, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid. Filing for the patent term extension has been made with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.
 
Intermezzo
 As of December 31, 2018, our patent portfolio of owned or exclusively licensed patents and applications includes four issued U.S. patents directed to formulations and methods of use. The issued U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2029.
Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Trademarks
 We have registered trademarks and service marks or pending trademark and services mark applications in a number of countries for PARATEK, PARATEK & HEXAGON DESIGN, PARATEK POSITIVE PATIENT STORIES, NUZYRA and its design logo, and other marks which we presently use or may use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as with our product candidates.  SEYSARA is a trademark for which Almirall has applied for in the United States and for which Paratek has applied for in a number of foreign countries.  In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and in various international jurisdictions, we routinely seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate.    
Collaborations and License Agreements
 Our commercial strategy is to partner with established pharmaceutical companies to develop and market products for the larger community markets, while retaining certain rights to products aimed at concentrated markets, such as hospital-based products, where we may seek to participate in development and commercialization.

Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
 On April 21, 2017, Paratek Bermuda Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Zai entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Zai Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement, Paratek Bermuda Ltd. granted Zai an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize omadacycline, or the licensed product, in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, or the Zai territory, for all human therapeutic and preventative uses other than biodefense. Zai will be responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the licensed product in the Zai territory, at its sole cost with certain assistance from Paratek Bermuda Ltd.
 Under the terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement, Paratek Bermuda Ltd. earned an upfront cash payment of $7.5 million in April 2017 and $5.0 million upon approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, submission in the CABP indication, which occurred on October 2, 2018.  Paratek Bermuda Ltd. is eligible to receive up to $9.0 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments and $40.5 million in potential future commercial milestone payments, the next being $3.0 million upon submission of the first regulatory approval application for a licensed product in the People’s Republic of China, or PRC. The terms of the Zai Collaboration Agreement also provide for Zai to pay Paratek Bermuda Ltd. tiered royalties at a low double digit to mid-teen percent on net sales of the licensed product in the Zai territory.
 The Zai Collaboration Agreement will continue, on a region-by-region basis, until the expiration of and payment by Zai of all Zai’s payment obligations, which is until the later of: (i) the abandonment, expiry or final determination of invalidity of the last valid claim within the Paratek patents that covers the licensed product in the region in the Zai territory in the manner that Zai or its affiliates or sublicensees exploit the licensed product or intend for the licensed product to be exploited; or (ii) the eleventh anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such region.
 Almirall, LLC
 In July 2007, we and Warner Chilcott Company, Inc. (which became a part of Allergan), entered into a collaborative research and license agreement under which we granted Allergan an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize tetracycline products for use in the United States for the treatment of acne and rosacea. In August 2018, Allergan assigned to Almirall, LLC, or Almirall, its rights under the collaboration agreement, or the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. Since Allergan did not exercise its development option with respect to the treatment of rosacea prior to initiation of a Phase 3 trial for the product, the license grant to Allergan, which was assigned to Almirall, converted to a non-exclusive license for the treatment of rosacea as of December 2014. Under the terms of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, we and Almirall are responsible for, and are obligated to use, commercially reasonable efforts to conduct specified development activities for the treatment of acne and, if requested by Almirall, we may conduct certain additional development activities to the extent we determine in good faith that we have the necessary resources available for such activities. Almirall has agreed to reimburse us for its costs and expenses, including third-party costs, incurred in conducting any such development activities.  
 Under the terms of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, Almirall is responsible for and is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tetracycline compounds that are specified in the agreement for the treatment of acne. We have agreed during the term of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any tetracycline compounds in the United States for the treatment of acne, and Almirall has agreed during the term of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement not to directly or indirectly develop or commercialize any tetracycline compound included as part of the agreement for any use other than as provided in the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. 
 The Almirall Collaboration Agreement contains two performance obligations: (i) an exclusive license to research, develop and commercialize tetracycline products for use in the United States for the treatment of acne and rosacea and (ii) research and development services. The performance obligation to deliver the license was satisfied upon execution of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement in July 2007.  All research and development services were completed by December 2010.  The options provided to Almirall for additional development services do not provide Almirall with a material right as these services will not be provided at a significant or incremental discount.  As such, the option services are not performance obligations.
 13


We received an upfront fee in the amount of $4.0 million upon the execution of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, $1.0 million upon filing of an Investigational NDA in 2010, $2.5 million upon initiation of Phase 2 trials in 2012 and $4.0 million upon initiation of Phase 3 trials associated with the Almirall Collaboration Agreement in December 2014.
 In December 2017, the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for sarecycline was received, triggering a milestone payment of $5.0 million earned upon acceptance of an NDA for a product licensed under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement. As the performance obligation to deliver the license was satisfied in 2007 and research and development services completed by December 2010, all subsequent milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the risk of significant reversal is resolved, generally when the milestone event occurs.  Therefore, the $5.0 million milestone payment was recognized in December 2017 and subsequently collected in the first quarter of 2018.

 In October 2018, the FDA’s regulatory approval of sarecycline, under the tradename SEYSARA, triggered the last milestone payment under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement of $12.0 million. Since FDA approval of SEYSARA was outside of the Company’s control and not obtained until October 2, 2018, the achievement of the milestone was not deemed probable and the risk of significant reversal of revenue was not resolved until such time.  Upon the FDA approval, the uncertainty related to this milestone was resolved and a significant reversal of revenue would not occur in future periods.  As such, the $12.0 million milestone payment was recognized as revenue at the time of FDA approval. Almirall is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties, ranging from the mid-single digits to the low double digits, based on net sales of tetracycline compounds developed under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement, with a standard royalty reduction post patent expiration for such product for the remainder of the royalty term. Almirall’s obligation to pay us royalties for each tetracycline compound it commercializes under the Almirall Collaboration Agreement expires on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent that covers the tetracycline compound in the United States and the date on which generic drugs that compete with the tetracycline compound reach a certain threshold market share in the United States. 

 Either we or Almirall may terminate the Almirall Collaboration Agreement for certain specified reasons at any time after Almirall has commenced development of any tetracycline compound, including if Almirall determines that it would not be commercially viable to continue to develop or commercialize the tetracycline compound and/or that it is unlikely to obtain regulatory approval of the tetracycline compound, and, in any case, no backup tetracycline compound is in development or ready to be developed and the parties are unable to agree on an extension of the development program or an alternative course of action. Either we or Almirall may terminate the Almirall Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s uncured breach of a material term of the agreement on 60 days’ notice (unless the breach relates to a payment term, which requires a 30-day notice) or upon the bankruptcy of the other party that is not discharged within 60 days. Upon the termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement by Almirall for our breach, Almirall’s license will continue following the effective date of termination, subject to the payment by Almirall of the applicable milestone and royalty payments specified in the agreement unless our breach was with respect to certain specified obligations, in which event the obligation of Almirall to pay us any further royalty or milestone payments will terminate. Upon the termination of the Almirall Collaboration Agreement by us for Almirall’s breach or the voluntary termination of the agreement by Almirall, Almirall‘s license under the agreement will terminate.
 
Tufts University
 In February 1997, we and Tufts entered into a license agreement under which we acquired an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property of Tufts related to the drug resistance field to develop and commercialize products for the treatment or prevention of bacterial or microbial diseases or medical conditions in humans or animals or for agriculture. We subsequently entered into eleven amendments to that agreement, or collectively the Tufts License Agreement, to include patent applications filed after the effective date of the original license agreement, to exclusively license additional technology from Tufts, to expand the field of the agreement to include disinfectant applications, and to change the royalty rate and percentage of sublicense income paid by us to Tufts under sublicense agreements with specified sublicensees. We are obligated under the Tufts License Agreement to provide Tufts with annual diligence reports and a business plan and to meet certain other diligence milestones. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights to third parties, which will be subject to the prior approval of Tufts unless the proposed sublicensee meets a certain net worth or market capitalization threshold. We are primarily responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent applications and patents covering the intellectual property licensed under the Tufts License Agreement at our sole expense. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed intellectual property against infringement by third parties. 
 14


We issued Tufts 1,024 shares of our common stock on the date of execution of the original license agreement, and we may be required to make certain payments of up to $0.3 million to Tufts upon the achievement by products developed under the agreement of specified development and regulatory approval milestones. We have already made a payment of $50,000 to Tufts for achieving the first milestone following commencement of the Phase 3 clinical trial for omadacycline and a payment of $100,000 to Tufts for achieving the second milestone following our first marketing application (NDA) submitted in the United States. We are also obligated to pay Tufts a minimum royalty payment in the amount of $25,000 per year. In addition, we are obligated to pay Tufts royalties based on gross sales of products, as defined in the agreement, ranging in the low single digits depending on the applicable field of use for such product sale. If we enter into a sublicense under the Tufts License Agreement, based on the applicable field of use for such product, we will be obligated to pay Tufts (i) a percentage, ranging from 10% to 14% (ten percent to fourteen percent) for compounds other than omadacycline, and a percentage in the single digits for the compound omadacycline, of that portion of any sublicense issue fees or maintenance fees received by us that are reasonably attributable to the sublicense of the rights granted to us under the Tufts License Agreement and (ii) the lesser of (a) a percentage, ranging from the low tens to the high twenties based on the applicable field of use for such product, of the royalty payments made to us by the sublicensee or (b) the amount of royalty payments that would have been paid by us to Tufts if we had sold the products.  We paid a sublicense issue fee in the low six figures to Tufts during the year ended December 31, 2017 upon earning the $7.5 million upfront payment under the Zai Collaboration Agreement.
 Unless terminated earlier, the Tufts License Agreement will expire at the same time as the last-to-expire patent in the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement and after any such expiration we will continue to have an exclusive, fully-paid-up license to such intellectual property licensed from Tufts. Tufts has the right to terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ notice should we fail to make a material payment under the Tufts License Agreement or commit a material breach of the agreement and not cure such failure or breach within such 30-day period, or if, after we have started to commercialize a product under the Tufts License Agreement, we cease to carry on its business for a period of 90 consecutive days. We have the right to terminate the Tufts License Agreement at any time upon 180 days’ notice. Tufts has the right to convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license if we do not commercialize a product licensed under the agreement within a specified time period. 
 Purdue Pharma L.P.
 In July 2009, we and Purdue Pharma L.P., or Purdue Pharma, entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, which granted an exclusive license to Purdue Pharma to commercialize Intermezzo in the United States in exchange for a non-refundable license fee, certain milestone payments and tiered royalties on net sales of Intermezzo. 
 In December 2013, Purdue Pharma notified us that it intended to discontinue use of the Purdue Pharma sales force to actively market Intermezzo to healthcare professionals during the first quarter of 2014.
 In October 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a special dividend of, among other things, the right to receive, on a pro rata basis, 100% of any royalty income received by us pursuant to the Purdue Collaboration Agreement and 90% of any cash proceeds from a sale or disposition of Intermezzo, less fees and expenses incurred in connection with such activity, to the extent that either occurred prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. On October 28, 2016, in satisfaction of our payment obligation of the proceeds of sale or disposition of the Intermezzo assets to the former Transcept stockholders under the Merger Agreement, we executed a royalty sharing agreement, or the Royalty Sharing Agreement, with the Special Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, or the Special Committee, a committee established in connection with the Merger. Under the Royalty Sharing Agreement, we agreed to pay to the former Transcept stockholders 50% of all royalty income received by us pursuant to the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, net of all costs, fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, related agreements, the Intermezzo product and the administration of the royalty income to the Transcept stockholders. The NDA for Intermezzo was then withdrawn from the FDA by Purdue Pharma as of December 31, 2018 and further sales of the drug are not planned.  Neither us nor the former shareholders of Transcept will receive future cash payments pursuant to the Royalty Sharing Agreement.  As such, we wrote off the remaining balance of the Intermezzo product rights during the fourth quarter of 2018.
 U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
 In October 2016, we announced that we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases to study omadacycline against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance. These studies are designed to confirm humanized dosing regimens of omadacycline in order to study the efficacy of omadacycline against biodefense pathogens, including Yersinia pestis, or plague, and Bacillus anthracis, or anthrax. Funding support for the trial has been made available through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA/ Joint Science and Technology Office and Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense / Joint Project Manager Medical Countermeasure Systems / BioDefense Therapeutics.

Past Collaborations
 Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd.
 In September 2009, we and Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, entered into a Collaborative Development, Manufacture and Commercialization License Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, which provided Novartis with a global, exclusive patent and technology license for the development, manufacturing and marketing of omadacycline. The Novartis Agreement was terminated by Novartis without cause in June 2011 and the termination was effective 60 days later. We and Novartis subsequently entered into a letter agreement in January 2012, or the Novartis Letter Agreement, as amended, pursuant to which we reconciled shared development costs and expenses and granted Novartis a right of first negotiation with respect to commercialization rights of omadacycline following approval of omadacycline from the FDA, EMA, or any regulatory agency, but only to the extent we had not previously granted such commercialization rights related to omadacycline to another third party as of any such approval. We also agreed to pay Novartis a 0.25% royalty, to be paid from net sales received by us in any country following the launch of omadacycline in that country and continuing until the later of expiration of the last active valid patent claim covering such product in the country of sale and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale in such country. The amended Novartis Letter Agreement resulted in a long-term liability in the amount of $3.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 included within “Other Long-Term Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. There are no other payment obligations to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement or the amended Novartis Letter Agreement.
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, advertising, promotion, storage, distribution, and export and import of our products.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 NDA Approval Processes
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulation require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizures or recalls;
--+-----------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use, conducted in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards and FDA requirements for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical or nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and any amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and any amendments before a clinical trial commences or continues at that institution, approve the information regarding the clinical trial and the informed consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the target disease or condition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 17


During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurred, a sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement, a voluntary process the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of a Phase 3 clinical trial protocol and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA agreement process, a sponsor that meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and must provide information necessary for discussion and agreement on the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA has a goal of evaluating the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and/or requests for additional information. An SPA agreement request must be made before the proposed clinical trial begins. If an agreement is reached, it will be documented in writing and made part of the record. The agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. Also, if the sponsor makes any unilateral changes to the approved protocol, the agreement will be invalidated. A SPA agreement is intended to provide greater assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of NDA approval. However, SPA agreements are not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate, and final determinations of approvability will not be made until the FDA completes its review of the entire NDA.
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for certain drugs and biologics.  Specifically, PREA requires original NDAs, biologic license applications, or BLAs, and supplements thereto for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The FDA has waived the pediatric study requirement for ages 0 to < 8 years because there is nonclinical evidence strongly suggesting that omadacycline would be unsafe in this pediatric group due to the risk of tetracycline-associated tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia, and the risk of tetracycline-associated inhibition of bone growth.  The FDA has deferred submission of pediatric studies for ages 8 to < 18 (ABSSSI until 2024 and CABP until 2026) years because the product was ready for approval for use in adults.  
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life.
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease or condition may receive priority review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application.  The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider a major amendment to the application following the original submission.
 18


The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing complies with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s safety, identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendation. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. In addition, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. 
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the FDA ultimately decides that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval, the FDA will issue a complete response letter to indicate that the agency will not approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases with the potential, based on nonclinical or clinical data, to fill an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of treatment for a serious condition an expedited review within eight months from the completed submission (six months from filing) as compared to a standard review time of twelve months from the completed submission (10 months from filing) for a standard new molecular entity NDA. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track-designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review.
 The GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new QIDPs. A new drug that is designated as a QIDP after a request by the sponsor that is made before an NDA is submitted will be eligible, if approved, for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have previously been eligible. In addition, a QIDP will receive priority review and qualify for a Fast Track designation. QIDPs are defined as antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen or qualifying pathogens identified by the FDA. Examples of pathogens that may be designated as a qualifying pathogen include MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. Omadacycline (both IV and oral formulations) has been designated as a QIDP for complicated UTI, ABSSSI and CABP.
 Beyond GAIN Act
 In addition to the GAIN Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, established a new FDA limited population pathway for antimicrobial drugs that treat serious or life-threatening infections for which there are unmet medical needs.  The United States Congress has initiated a significant number of other legislative proposals in recent years to provide further incentives in anti-infective development.  For example, in December 2018, the Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act of 2018, or DISARM Act, was introduced in the Senate to incentivize the research and development of advanced antibiotics through certain reimbursement-related incentives. It is possible that these or other proposals related to anti-infective development may be enacted into law in the future.  We cannot predict whether or what legislative changes will be enacted or how they may impact our business and our products.  
 19


Patent Term Restoration and Data Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for a single patent for an approved product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. We have applied for restoration of patent term for NUZYRA and SEYSARA, as detailed in the Intellectual Property Section. 
 Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company using the drug entitled to data exclusivity as the reference listed drug, or RLD. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the use or conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other uses or conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 In addition, as described above, under the GAIN Act a new drug that is designated as a QIDP is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain other exclusivity periods that the application may qualify for upon approval, specifically five-year exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides for an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added on to patent and exclusivity periods in effect at the time the pediatric exclusivity award is granted, if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. The FDA may request studies on approved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. To date, we have not received any Written Requests.
Post-approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems, including safety issues, with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA and other authorities also strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. Under the FDCA the sponsor of an approved drug in the United States may not promote that drug for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an off-label use in accordance with the practice of medicine. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including sanctions, civil and criminal fines, and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct.
 Moreover, any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
  
• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug sampling and distribution requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws.
 Failure to comply with the FDCA and other applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
  
• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning letters, untitled letters and similar communications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizures or recalls;
--+-----------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 We may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Within the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Violations of “fraud and abuse” laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
 Laws and regulations have also 
been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; 
and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial 
interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State 
laws may also require disclosure 
of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year
. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our 
activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
 Federal and state laws also protect the privacy and security of health information specifically or other personally identifiable information generally.  The laws may apply to us or to healthcare providers and other third parties with which we interact.
 21


Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under the centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedures, or under the purely national route of approval. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicines, and is optional for other medicines that are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the EMA, where it will be evaluated by the relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states and, by extension (after national implementing measures), in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. In general, an initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure allows marketing authorization applications to be submitted simultaneously in two or more EU member states, whereas the mutual recognition procedure must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU member state.  Both the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures provide for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one-member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must approve the assessment report and related materials, unless they identify a serious risk to public health.  Under the mutual recognition procedure, the concerned member states have the same 90-day period to recognize the marketing authorization in the reference member state.  In either case, concerns about serious risks to public health escalate through the relevant EMA scientific committees, and the disputed points may eventually result in a consensus opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that is referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.  The purely national procedure results in a marketing authorization in a single EU member state. 
 In light of the United Kingdom’s vote in 2016 to leave the EU, the so-called Brexit vote, there may be changes forthcoming in the scope of the EU marketing authorization approval procedure, as well as changes to the United Kingdom’s national medicines laws, as the terms of that exit are negotiated between the United Kingdom and the EU.  
 Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from 
third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities or government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private entities, such as managed care organizations
, private health insurers and other 
organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be 
separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or 
formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Some third-party payors may manage utilization of a particular product by requiring pre-approval (known as “prior authorization”) for coverage of particular prescriptions (to allow the payor to assess medical necessity). Moreover, patients who cannot meet the conditions of prior authorizations are often prevented from obtaining the prescribed medication, because they cannot afford to pay for the medication without reimbursement. 
 Third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain net price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of new products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for any current or future product, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is complex and costly.
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our or our partners’ products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our or our partners’ products could reduce physician usage of the product and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the increasing influence of managed care (and related implementation of managed care strategies to control utilization), additional federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to regulate pricing of drugs, limit coverage of drugs or reduce reimbursement for drugs, public scrutiny and the Trump administration’s expressed desire to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals in the U.S.    While we cannot predict what executive, legislative and regulatory proposals will be adopted or other actions will occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.
 Within the United States, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid.  Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices.  We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.  
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Health Care and Other Reform
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. Federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.  Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, 
tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates 
the tax penalty established under Healthcare Reform Act 
for individuals who do not maintain mandated 
health insurance coverage beginning in 2019.  In a May 2018 
report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, 
the number of uninsured will increase 
by 3 
million in 2019 and 6 
million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate.  The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge.  In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects.

There have also been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration, including initiatives focused on drug pricing.  For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70% starting in 2019.   As another example, in May of 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs.  Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry.  As another example, in November of 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed revisions to Medicare Part D to support health plans’ negotiation of lower drug prices with manufacturers and reduce health plan members’ out-of-pocket costs. The Office of Inspector General, or OIG, within the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued a proposed rule in February of 2019 that would revise the federal anti-kickback statute to limit protection for discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), Medicare Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care plans that are not reflected in the price charged to the patient at the pharmacy counter and to provide protection only for certain types of service fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs.
 There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals.  There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
 General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our current or future products 
if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
