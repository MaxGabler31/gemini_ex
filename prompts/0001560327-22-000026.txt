Overview
Rapid7 is advancing security with visibility, analytics, and automation delivered through our Insight Platform. Our solutions simplify the complex, allowing security teams to work more effectively with IT and development to reduce vulnerabilities, monitor for misconfigurations and malicious behavior, investigate and shut down attacks, and automate routine tasks.
In the over 20 years that Rapid7 has been in business, security companies and trends have come and gone, while broader technology innovation continues to advance rapidly. Every company is now a technology company, and rampant innovation inevitably creates security risk. The migration of businesses to the cloud, more distributed workforces, and ubiquitous connected devices present security teams with an increasingly complex, ever-changing, and unpredictable attack surface. 
We believe as cybersecurity challenges continue to rise exponentially, two key factors can prevent organizations from effectively managing their growing security exposure. First, the tools to manage complex security problems are often equally complicated to use. Second, there is a scarcity of cybersecurity professionals who are qualified to successfully manage these sophisticated tools. These two factors compound the difficulties that resource-constrained organizations face when attempting to minimize their security exposure, meet security compliance regulations and provide visibility to their leadership. We call the expanding divide between risk created through innovation and risk effectively managed by security teams the security achievement gap.
We believe Rapid7 is uniquely positioned to improve how security challenges are addressed. Our solutions and services are built with and supported by the expertise of our dedicated team of security researchers, expert SOC analysts and consultants, who bring knowledge of attacker behavior and emerging vulnerabilities directly to customers. We also continue to invest in further simplifying our technology to improve usability, lowering the barrier for teams and organizations who lack resources to manage their security posture.
While our security technology is the foundation of our mission to make successful security accessible to all, technology alone will not solve today’s cybersecurity challenges. Our ongoing commitment to researching and partnering with the technology community helps to curb new security risks born through innovation. We are also investing in under-served, at risk communities, like non-profits and hospitals, to better understand their needs and make security technology and services accessible. By continuously improving our technology, stemming the creation of risk in the community, and making security more usable and accessible, Rapid7 aims to close the security achievement gap .
As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 10,000 customers that rely on Rapid7 technology, services, and research to improve security outcomes and securely advance their organizations. We have experienced strong revenue growth with revenue increasing from $200.9 million in 2017 to $535.4 million in 2021, representing a 28% compound annual growth rate. 
In 2021, 2020 and 2019 recurring revenue, defined as revenue from term software licenses, content subscriptions, managed services, cloud-based subscriptions and maintenance and support, was 92%, 90% and 87%, respectively, of total revenue. We incurred net losses of $146.3 million, $98.8 million and $53.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as we continued to invest for long-term growth.

Insight Platform
Our cloud-native Insight Platform is at the core of our product offerings. The platform was built using our extensive experience in collecting and analyzing data to enable our customers to create and manage analytics-driven cybersecurity risk management programs. By utilizing our powerful, proprietary analytics to assess and understand the context and relationships around users, IT assets and cyber threats within a customer’s environment, our solutions make it easier for teams to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, monitor for misconfigurations and malicious behavior, investigate and shutdown attacks, and automate operations. 
Our Insight Platform provides a high level of scalability. We leverage cloud technologies to achieve a scalable delivery model with a high degree of redundancy, fault tolerance, and cost-effectiveness. 
We also designed our Insight Platform to provide a secure environment for our customers' data. We deploy a variety of technologies and practices that are designed to help ensure that the data collected from a customer’s environment remains proprietary, secure and operational.
Insight Platform's Features:
Visibility: The Insight Platform allows security professionals to collect data once across their IT environment, enabling Security, IT, and development operations (DevOps) teams to collaborate effectively as they analyze shared data. 
•Unified Data Collection: We designed the Insight Platform to allow customers to collect their data once and leverage that same data across multiple solutions, providing shared visibility across teams and reducing time to value for additional solutions. Our robust data collection architecture supports gathering a wide swath of operational data from endpoints to the cloud, including key data about assets and user-specific behavior, into a unified, searchable dataset. 
•Agentless and Agent-Based Architecture: We developed our platform with flexible processing technologies that employ both agentless data collection and our own internally-developed endpoint agent technology, which enables rapid and seamless integration of our products into our customers’ modern IT environments and provides security and IT professionals with instant visibility into their dynamic and rapidly-expanding IT ecosystem. Our lightweight endpoint Insight Agent is designed to automatically collect data from all endpoints, even those from remote workers and sensitive assets that cannot be actively scanned, or that rarely join the corporate network.
•Endpoint Detection and Visibility: With a universal lightweight agent and endpoint scanning, the Insight Platform provides real-time detection and the ability to proactively remediate IT environments, before a potential attack happens.
•Network Traffic Analysis: Network flow data illuminates environments and helps accelerate investigations. Our lightweight Network Sensor passively analyzes raw traffic to increase visibility into user activity, pinpoint real threats, and accelerate investigation with granular detail of attacker movement.

•Attack Surface Monitoring with Project Sonar: As organizations grow and infrastructure becomes more complex, maintaining visibility into attack surface becomes more challenging. Our platform directly integrates with Project Sonar, a Rapid7 research project that regularly scans the public internet, to gain insights into global exposure to common vulnerabilities. This capability also enables security professionals to identify previously unknown, externally facing assets connected to the internet.
Analytics: Increasing IT environment complexity coupled with a severe lack of cybersecurity professionals is overwhelming security and IT teams, who are struggling to deal with false positives and maintain adequate levels of cybersecurity. Our Insight Platform addresses these challenges with the following features:
•User and Attacker Behavior Analytics: Our Insight Platform incorporates extensive user behavior analytics (UBA) and attacker behavior analytics (ABA) to provide rapid context around users, attackers and assets involved in an incident, enabling organizations to more quickly respond to, contain and mitigate breaches. Our platform incorporates comprehensive UBA to create a behavior profile for each user and correlates every event with a user, asset or application to detect compromised credentials, lateral movement and other malicious behavior. 
•Risk Prioritization and Management: With built-in risk assessment and risk prioritization, IT-integrated remediation projects, and pre-built automation workflows, the Insight Platform provides a granular view of what is relevant and critical today, to help ensure risks can be prioritized and mitigated more effectively. 
•Threat Detection: Our Insight Platform includes integrated threat feeds, informed by public data as well as proprietary threat intelligence and adversary research, and continuously gathers and combines them with a customer’s IT environment, to show threats that are most relevant to them.
•Centralized Log Management: Our cloud-based platform correlates millions of daily events in any IT environment directly to the users and assets behind them to highlight risk across the environment and help prioritize where to search and automate compliance without the requirement of extensive hardware.
•Deception Technology: Monitoring solutions that only analyze log files leave traces of the attacker unfound. Through our deep understanding of attacker behavior, our Insight Platform provides not only UBA and endpoint detection, but also easy-to-deploy intruder traps. These include honeypots, honey users, honey credentials, and honey files, all crafted to identify malicious behavior earlier in the attack chain.

Insight Platform Product Offerings
We offer our Insight Platform solutions as software-as-a-service products, on a subscription basis. Our Insight Platform products are available globally and reduce the need for customers to manage large, complex, data infrastructure. We offer the following cloud products across the main pillars of Security Operations (SecOps):
InsightIDR: InsightIDR, our Incident Detection and Response (IDR) solution, is designed to enable organizations to rapidly detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents and breaches across physical, virtual and cloud assets. 
InsightIDR unifies SIEM, UBA, and endpoint detection to detect stealthy attacks across today’s complex networks. It analyzes the billions of events that occur daily in organizations to reduce them to the important behaviors and deliver high-fidelity and prioritized alerts. In addition to identifying stealthy attacks often missed by other solutions, InsightIDR focuses the security team on issues that warrant investigation and reduces the time to investigate with its user correlation, powerful search and endpoint interrogation capabilities.
Table of Contents

InsightIDR is designed to provide a cost-effective response to the need for a modern SIEM or XDR solution. With our Metasploit community, research and incident response services, we are continually studying and identifying the latest attacker methods. We have found ways to increase accuracy, speed processes, and achieve greater confidence, even as attacker methods change. These include built-in deception capabilities such as honeypots and automated threat intelligence feeds that quickly alert our customers to new attacker behaviors seen in the wild by our own threat hunters.
Unlike most SIEMs, InsightIDR also provides the capability to seamlessly act on many threats automatically, thus further reducing the time from detection to response. InsightIDR includes out-of-the-box automation workflows to improve analyst productivity such as automated containment to mitigate an attack. Additionally, with the Insight Agent, users can kill malicious processes or quarantine infected endpoints from the network. They can also use InsightIDR to take containment actions across Active Directory, Access Management, EDR, and firewall tools.
InsightIDR also offers modules for Enhanced Network Traffic Analysis and Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry. Enhanced Network Traffic Analysis continuously monitors network traffic at any location or site across your network. This data increases visibility across the attack surface and detects intrusions (or other potential security events) on the network. Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry is the collection of detailed activity logs that are sent to InsightIDR each time a process starts on a monitored endpoint. In short, these logs give visibility into all endpoint activity—whether events occurred before, during, or after a detection. With this holistic view into endpoint activity, customers can unlock custom use cases and enrich investigations in InsightIDR.
InsightIDR is offered through a cloud-based subscription or as a managed service. The managed service is known as Managed Detection and Response, a fully outsourced service that combines our team of expert analysts with InsightIDR. When attacks are found, customers are promptly informed of all known details and our team moves to incident response, providing security teams with detailed, easy-to-follow remediation steps tailored to the environment.

We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders and fit within our company culture. In addition to their base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company’s goals with short-term incentives and long-term equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees a wide array of benefits such as life and health (medical, dental and vision) insurance, paid time off and retirement benefits. We also provide emotional well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. Initially, this included having the vast majority of our employees work from home while implementing additional safety measures, including regular testing for employees continuing critical on-site work. In 2021, we began to selectively reopen certain offices in a phased approach and to hold in-person or hybrid meetings, on a voluntary basis, taking into consideration government restrictions and employee safety. Moving forward we intend to continue with a hybrid work model through which we balance our view that the office remains a critical environment for mentorship, career development and the kinds of lasting bonds that create a great work culture, with flexibility and trust in our employees to work with their teams to find the right model that allows for us to deliver for our customers.

We believe in investing in the growth and development of all of our employees so they may build the career experience of their lifetime. “Never Done” is one of our core values, and our employees take advantage of a myriad of opportunities for continuous learning, both through internal training and development programs, on-demand learning modules, and access to content-specific curriculum based on need and interest. We have designed and implemented learning experiences for our employees at every stage of their careers. This includes our tailored leadership development programs for both non-technical and technical leaders. Both programs align to our core values and promote the leadership skills and behaviors we believe are critical to the success of our mission, customers, and development of our people. As a supporter of a promote-from-within culture, we actively mentor and invest in the pipeline of our future leaders by providing pathways for growth, development, and promotion on an ongoing basis through our early leader programs. Additionally, new employees engage in our 90-day onboarding experience, Making the Band, which is intended to support the embodiment of our core values, and shorten their time to create impact.
To supplement our internal programs, as well as provide opportunities for independent study, employees have access to online education tools to build the necessary skills related to one’s role and a digital library curated for our employees. To further invest in the future of cybersecurity and to deliver on our company mission, we are continuing to strengthen our programming for emerging talent and early career individuals. Building this programming will support individuals in our various programs that offer early career opportunities.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a company culture focused on diversity and inclusion is a key driver of creativity and innovation and that diverse and inclusive teams make better business decisions, which ultimately drive better business outcomes. We are committed to recruiting, retaining and developing high-performing, innovative and engaged employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Several years ago, we set out to ensure we were creating a more diverse workforce population, while simultaneously ensuring we are creating the best possible environment for everyone to thrive. Specifically, we sought to increase the number of under-represented groups (in particular women and people of color) to 50% of the employee base in the U.S. Having achieved those goals, we have since adapted our focus and progress to increase our global population of women from 29% as of December 31, 2020 to 35% by December 31, 2022. Additionally, we are investing in our recruiting and retaining of employees who identify as Black, Latinx or multi-racial, with the goal of increasing our U.S. population of this demographic from 13% as of December 31, 2020 to 18% by December 31, 2022. We undertook to promote transparency by publishing our workforce demographic data and increasing thoughtful discussions across the Company, including unconscious

bias training for our employees. In addition, we expanded our efforts to recruit under-represented groups through referrals and beyond the traditional networks from which we previously recruited. 
We are also focused on identifying and promoting diverse leaders through the organization at all levels and signed the Corporate Parity Pledge, which includes, among other things, a commitment to interview at least one woman and one person of color for every open role at the vice president level and above. We have also directed our talent acquisition team to take the further step of interviewing at least one woman and/or person of color for every role we hire for. 
Community Involvement & The Rapid7 Cybersecurity Foundation
We give back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We partner with a variety of STEM and inclusion-focused programs to promote technology education for all. Beyond contributions of cash, we encourage employee volunteerism at all our locations. In 2021, working with the Tides Foundation, we paid out nearly $0.3 million to organizations, principally those engaged in helping create a more diverse and inclusive technology workforce, through the Rapid7 for Good Fund. In 2021, we also formed the Rapid7 Cybersecurity Foundation. The Foundation’s mission, which aligns closely to that of Rapid7, is to help close the cybersecurity achievement gap by promoting a more diverse and inclusive cyber workforce; supporting free and open cybersecurity solutions; and advocating for those that often lack a voice in advancing security. We seeded the Foundation with $1.0 million.
