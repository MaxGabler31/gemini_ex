ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW- HISTORY
 
Proteo, Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed on December 18, 1992. Proteo, Inc. has one wholly owned subsidiary, Proteo Biotech AG ("PBAG"), a German corporation (Proteo, Inc. and PBAG are hereinafter collectively referred to as "we", "our", the "Company" and "Proteo"). The Company's common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol "PTEO".
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Proteo is a clinical stage drug development company and intends to develop, promote and market pharmaceuticals and other biotech products. The Company's focus is on the development of anti-inflammatory treatments for rare diseases with significant unmet needs.
 
The Company is engaged in the development of pharmaceuticals based on the body's own tools and weapons to fight inflammatory diseases. Specifically, we are focusing our research on the development of drugs based on the human protein Elafin. We strongly believe that Elafin will be useful in the treatment of post-surgery damage to tissue, complications resulting from organ transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, serious injuries caused by accidents, cardiac infarction, as well as other diseases.
 
Several countries have passed laws or made provisions in order to make the development of drugs for rare diseases financially attractive to the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies developing new medicaments for the treatment of rare diseases (orphan drugs) receive assistance for their approval and marketing. Orphan drugs are pharmaceuticals for the treatment of rare diseases, which do not affect more than 200,000 people in the United States of America (“US”) and about 250,000 people in the European Union according to the respective legislations. The advantage of developing orphan drugs is seen in the fact that companies can apply for an orphan drug designation in the US or European Union. This is associated with reduced fees to regulatory agencies and guarantees 7-year or 10-year marketing exclusivity in the US and European Union, respectively, on drug sales for the first company to obtain marketing approval of a particular drug in the respective regions.
 
In contrast to drug development for widespread diseases, orphan drug development costs can be significantly lower. Compared with other drugs, fewer requirements have to be met for the clinical trials, particularly those relating to the number of patients. The marketing expenses of orphan drugs are significantly lower, as treatment is generally conducted by a limited number of specialized doctors. The Company believes that it is favorable to target orphan drug indications in the field of post-surgery damage to tissue, organ transplantation, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
 
Proteo has obtained Orphan drug designations within the European Union for the use of Elafin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as well as for the treatment of esophageal cancer. In the latter indication, especially the acute postoperative inflammation, the main reason for postoperative morbidity, will be targeted by Elafin treatment. Within the United States, Proteo has obtained Orphan drug designations for the use of Elafin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as for the prevention of inflammatory complications of transthoracic esophagectomy.
 
Proteo’s pharmaceutical Elafin is a copy of a naturally occurring human anti-inflammatory substance. It is a natural antagonist of tissue destroying enzymes (proteases such as elastase and proteinase 3) that participate in the inflammatory mechanism of many diseases. Elafin’s ability to block the proteases that cause these undesirable effects makes it a promising drug for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and posttraumatic inflammatory complications. The beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of Elafin have been demonstrated by numerous preclinical studies in animal models of human diseases.

For the development of Elafin Proteo has established a network of globally renowned research institutes, physicians and hospitals in Europe and the US. The development of Elafin has been widely supported by public grants. Worldwide leading funding bodies, such as the American National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and the British Medical Research Council (“MRC”), supported preclinical and clinical studies on Elafin with high volume grants.
 
Proteo currently focuses on the clinical development of Elafin for treatment of acute postoperative inflammatory complications in the surgical therapy of esophageal cancer and for chronical treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”). Clinical trials for PAH will be conducted in cooperation with third parties, such as investigator-initiated trials funded by NIH.
 
Our strategy and goal is to develop into a profitable company by developing drug candidates for orphan diseases with high medical needs. The company intends to generate revenue by out-licensing and marketing activities. To date, the Company has not had profitable operations. Furthermore, we do not anticipate that we will have profitable operations in the near future.
 
The products and technologies we intend to develop will require significant commitments of personnel and financial resources. However, we do not believe that any of our planned products will produce sufficient revenues in the next several years to support us financially. To achieve profitable operations, the Company, independently or in collaboration with others, must successfully identify, develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for and market proprietary products.
 
CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT
 
After developing a production procedure for Elafin, the Company has initiated clinical trials to achieve governmental approval for the use of Elafin as a drug in Europe. For this purpose, the Company has contracted an experienced Contract Manufacturing Organization in Europe to produce Elafin in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) standards as required for clinical trials.
Safety and Tolerability in Acute Therapy
 
In a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled Phase I single dose escalating trial Elafin was well tolerated by healthy human subjects. In two Phase II studies with patients undergoing surgery for esophageal cancer and with patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting the excellent tolerability was confirmed.
Esophageal Cancer Surgery
 
Esophageal cancer is a life-threatening disease, which is classified as an orphan disease. The majority of patients with esophageal cancer present at an advanced stage with extensive lymph node metastasis. The curative treatment for this malignancy is consequently aggressive, consisting of chemoradiotherapy followed by radical esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy. Due to extensive surgical and pulmonary trauma and the long duration of surgery, esophagectomy is one of the most invasive and traumatic forms of thoracic surgery, and is associated with severe postoperative complications. The complications affect the lungs, heart and kidney and are associated with pronounced postoperative morbidity requiring ICU care. These complications may progress into life-threatening multiple organ failures. Esophagectomy is also associated with an unacceptably high rate of hospital mortality, which contributes to the low survival rate of esophageal cancer.
 
No specific measures for treatment or prevention of acute postoperative inflammatory complications exist and therapy is generally aimed at vital organ support and management of symptoms according to the individual circumstances. There is a demand for treatments that support an earlier recovery from this surgical procedure, prevent postoperative complications and lead to a reduction in the somatic, psychological and social stress associated with intensive care. A treatment that reduces the risk of postoperative complications is thus likely to make radical therapeutic options, such as transthoracic esophagectomy, accessible to a greater number of patients, particularly older patients and those with comorbidities.

A placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial on the effect of Elafin on the postoperative inflammatory reactions and postoperative clinical course was conducted in patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. The trial showed that Elafin had a positive effect on the period of recovery: 63 percent of the Elafin-treated patients required only one day of postoperative intensive care, while all patients in the placebo group needed several days of postoperative intensive medical care.
 
The Company received Protocol Assistance (scientific advice for orphan medicines) from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) at the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) with respect to the strategy for further clinical development and marketing authorization of Elafin for the prophylactic treatment of acute postoperative complications after resection of esophageal cancer. In December 2015, the EMA pediatric committee (“PDCO”) agreed that no investigations in pediatric populations will be performed, as children are almost not affected by this kind of cancer.
 
In January 2015, our subsidiary signed a contract with a contract research organization (“CRO”) for conducting a pivotal clinical trial with Elafin for the prophylactic treatment of acute postoperative complications after resection of esophageal cancer (“POSTCOM TRIAL”). In addition, our subsidiary commissioned the GMP manufacturing of the study drug. When sufficient resources are available, we plan to conduct the POSTCOM TRIAL at up to 10 sites in the European Union and it is expected to enroll 80 patients.
 
Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery
 
Coronary artery bypass surgery is a surgical procedure performed to relieve angina pectoris and reduce the risk of death from coronary artery disease. It is the most frequently performed operation in cardiovascular surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with a substantial risk of myocardial infarction, pulmonary and renal failure as well as stroke. No specific treatment exists which suppresses myocardial reperfusion injury and systemic inflammation occurring after coronary artery bypass surgery. Inflammation of cardiac muscle and the resulting muscle injury after a bypass operation remain a frequent and unresolved problem.
 
Since 2009, the Company has been cooperating with researchers at The University of Edinburgh with respect to the clinical development of Elafin for prevention of myocardial injury after coronary artery bypass surgery (“CABG”). Within the framework of collaboration, a clinical study (EMPIRE) was started in the third quarter of 2011. The EMPIRE (Elafin Myocardial Protection from Ischemia Reperfusion Injury) study, an investigator-initiated trial at Edinburgh University, was designed as a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled study on 87 patients to investigate the therapeutic potential of a single preoperative Elafin dose on postoperative myocardial injury. This was measured by troponin I plasma concentration which is released by damaged heart muscle cells and its plasma concentration correlates with overall damage of the heart muscle. It was assumed that this treatment would lower the troponin I release over 48 hours. The study was performed under the supervision of the cardiologist Dr. Peter Henriksen at NHS Lothian’s Edinburgh Heart Centre in association with The University of Edinburgh, one of the leading European universities in the area of cardiovascular research, and the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. The study was funded by the MRC and Chest Heart & Stroke Scotland (“CHSS”) with funding in excess of 500,000 GBP.
 
In November 2014, the NHS Lothian’s Edinburgh Heart Centre completed final analysis of data from the EMPIRE study with Proteo’s drug candidate Elafin for prevention of myocardial injury after CABG. No drug related adverse events and no evidence of excessive bleeding, cardiovascular complications or renal dysfunction was reported in this critical patient population. Statistically significant reduction of the area under the curve for plasma troponin I concentration profile over the first 48 hours could not be shown in this trial. Post-hoc analysis identified significantly reduced troponin I plasma concentrations by 41% within the first 6 hours after Elafin treatment. An unexpected skewed distribution of troponin I plasma concentrations in the patient groups was observed in the study and consequently the study turned out to be underpowered. This contradicts observations from an earlier UK study in CABG surgery patients, which was taken as a reference for the study design and sample size calculation. This study provides sufficient information for design of an adequately powered follow-up study with an indication that multiple doses in the postoperative period may be more effective. Results from this study contribute to our understanding of the therapeutic potential of Elafin and the time course of reperfusion injury in CABG. The results confirm the favorable safety profile of Elafin and additionally there are indications that Elafin has a beneficial effect on the protection of heart muscle tissue as long as Elafin is present in the blood. Details of the EMPIRE trial have been published in 2015 (Alam et al., Heart 2015).

Safety and Tolerability in chronic therapy
 
In March 2019, the recruitment for a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending-dose trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Elafin in healthy adult subjects has been started. The designs of the Phase I clinical trial and a Phase II proof of concept trial in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) have been discussed with the FDA.
  
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) is a life-threatening disease in which the pressure in a patient's pulmonary arteries becomes dangerously high. If untreated, patients have a 40% chance of surviving five years. While the advent of new therapies has likely improved the five-year survival rate to approximately 60%, there remains no specific cure for the disease. Despite the treatment progress during the last two decades there is still an unmet medical need for additional treatments. Proteo’s Elafin blocks the activity of enzymes that are involved in pulmonary arterial hypertension. We believe that this makes Elafin a highly promising compound for the treatment of the disease with a new mode of action. In preclinical studies, the treatment with Elafin attenuated fully developed PAH in an animal model with a pronounced and significant improvement of the vascular pathology, parameters of pulmonary hemodynamics, and right ventricular function. In humans, the obliteration of distal pulmonary arteries leads to a severe increase in pulmonary artery pressure and subsequently to right ventricular dysfunction. Reversal of this obliteration is a key goal in the treatment of PAH. Proteo has received orphan drug designations for Elafin in the US for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and in the European Union for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
 
Since 2008, Proteo has been cooperating with a team of scientists at Stanford University in California lead by Dr. Marlene Rabinovitch for the preclinical development of Elafin in the field PAH. Marlene Rabinovitch has published over 150 scientific publications and is among the leading scientists worldwide in the area of pulmonary hypertension. For more than a decade, she has been studying the significance of Elafin in vascular disease. Since 2011, the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has been supporting the Elafin PAH development program at Stanford University with a five-year high-volume grant.
 
In November 2015, we had a Pre-Investigational New Drug Application (“PIND”) Meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for discussing the development strategies for Elafin to be used for the treatment of PAH within the framework of our collaboration with Dr. Rabinovitch at Stanford University. In September 2016 we signed an agreement with a third party within the framework of our collaboration with Marlene Rabinovitch for an animal toxicity program for the use of Elafin in the treatment of PAH.
 
At year’s end 2015, our subsidiary has set up a three-year program for the development of a new subcutaneous formulation of Elafin for PAH treatment. We have submitted a grant application under a research and development grant program of the German State of Schleswig-Holstein covering up to 50% of total costs.
 
In June 2016, we announced that our subsidiary has been awarded a BFEI grant (the “Grant”) from the German State of Schleswig-Holstein. The Grant has a volume of up to EUR 874,000 (approximately $1,047,000) and will be used for the R&D program to develop a new formulation of Proteo's lead compound Elafin. If effective, a new Elafin formulation would allow Proteo to extend the development pipeline to treat chronic diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
 
In the first half of 2017 a respiratory safety pharmacology study and a 28-day toxicity study of Elafin subcutaneous dosage in rats were conducted by a third-party laboratory in the US. All tested doses were well tolerated.
 
In August 2017, the Company submitted a Drug Master File (“DMF”) for Elafin to the FDA for use in clinical trials within the United States. The DMF supports the investigator-initiated Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application of Marlene Rabinovitch at Stanford University. At the end of September 2017, the FDA has completed its safety review of the IND application and concluded that Marlene Rabinovitch at Stanford University may proceed with the proposed clinical investigation with Elafin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The conduct of a clinical Phase I trial (subcutaneous administration, 7 days in healthy volunteers) will be financed by a new NIH-funded project of our cooperation partners.

 In September 2018, we entered into a Clinical Material Transfer Agreement with our cooperation partners within the framework of the clinical Phase I trial, and as well into a Material Transfer Agreement with a third-party laboratory in the US.
 
In March 2019, the recruitment of healthy individuals for the Phase I clinical trial in the U.S. to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous administration of Elafin has been started. Proteo’s research partners and investigators at Stanford University School of Medicine, Dr. Marlene Rabinovitch and Dr. Roham Zamanian, are responsible for the conduct of the investigator-initiated trial.
 
PRECLINICAL RESEARCH
 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Lung Diseases
 
Since 2008, the Company has been cooperating with scientists at Stanford University in California with respect to the preclinical development in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension and ventilator-induced injury. The group presented preclinical data on the Company’s drug substance Elafin at the Annual International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in New Orleans in May 2010. The data showed that the treatment with Elafin during mechanical ventilation largely prevented the inflammation in lungs of newborn mice. In August 2010 the cooperation agreement with Stanford University was extended by a further project. In the third quarter of 2011 the Stanford School of Medicine research team led by Marlene Rabinovitch, was awarded a five-year, $10.8 million grant from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute for the study of Elafin’s ability to treat three distinct lung diseases. The grant has funded one preclinical project for each disease, all three of which are notoriously difficult to treat: pulmonary hypertension, ventilator-induced injury of the immature lung in premature babies, and chronic lung transplant rejection.
 
The group has published further evidence for the use of Elafin in the treatment of newborn infants whose lungs are incompletely developed in June 2012 (Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol). In May 2013, the group presented the successful treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in an animal model at the Annual International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia. They demonstrated in a Sugen/Hypoxia animal model of pulmonary arterial hypertension that intravenous Elafin administration can improve the occlusion of pulmonary vessels, which is associated with a pronounced improvement of the disease. In February 2015, the group has published new results which demonstrate that Elafin and cyclosporine act synergistically to prevent the development of irreversible damage to transplanted lung tissue in an animal model (American Journal of Transplantation, 2015). In June 2015, Nickel et al. published results showing that Elafin reverses pulmonary hypertension via caveolin-1-dependent bone morphogenetic protein signaling in an animal model of PAH. The potential of Elafin in the treatment of PAH was confirmed in further investigations using explanted lung tissue from PAH patients (American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 2015). In April 2017 the group has published data about Elafin’ ability to induce new vessel formation in vitro employing native pulmonary arterial endothelial cells from PAH patients (Sa et al.. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 2017). In July 2018, Alcazar et al. from Stanford University published a new mechanism by which Elafin rescues lung cell survival in the lung of newborn mice subjected to mechanical ventilation (Alejandre Alcazar et al., American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology, 2018). The new experimental findings, coupled with the research group’s observation of significantly increased plasma elastase levels in preterm infants with evolving neonatal chronic lung disease, support the notion that Elafin treatment might be effective in mitigating or preventing neonatal lung injury caused by mechanical ventilation.
 
Vascular damage
 
From 2010 to 2015, Proteo cooperated with the Molecular Imaging North Competence Center (MOIN CC) at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel. Under this collaboration the effects of Elafin on vascular changes were examined in animal models. The federal state of Schleswig-Holstein has backing the creation and infrastructure of MOIN CC with 8.2 million EUR using funding from the federal state and the European Regional Development Fund (“ERDF”), as well as resources from the second German economic stimulus package. In 2013, the researchers demonstrated that Elafin administration prevented intima hyperplasia in a rat model of percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. This indicates that Elafin might be effective in preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty, which is a frequent complication of this intervention in humans. In 2016, the researchers published the results of a biodistribution study with radiolabeled Elafin (Kaschwich et al., Drug Metab Pharmacokinet 2016). They found high accumulation in the kidney and concluded that this could be of great importance in the future as within the treatment of reperfusion injury of the kidney.

OUR SUBSIDIARY
 
PBAG, our wholly owned operating subsidiary, was formed in Kiel, Germany on April 6, 2000. PBAG is in the business of developing pharmaceutical products based on the human protein called Elafin and possible by-products thereof as well as related technologies. The members of the Management Board of PBAG are currently Birge Bargmann, Chief Executive Officer, and Juergen Paal, Chief Operating Officer. The members of the Supervisory Board of PBAG are Oliver Wiedow, MD, Florian Wegner and Florian Bargmann. PBAG had five employees (including management) as of December 31, 2018.
COLLABORATION WITH OTHER COMPANIES
 
The Company actively seeks further out-licensing partners, co-development partnerships and other collaborations with third parties to generate revenues and/or to expedite the Company's product development. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to build such alliances will be successful at any time or in any way.
COMPETITION
 
The market for our planned products and technologies is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase. We compete with many other companies involved in the development of pharmaceuticals, most of which are larger than Proteo. Some of our anticipated competitors offer a broad range of equipment, supplies, products and technology, including many of the products and technologies contemplated to be offered by us. To the extent that customers exhibit loyalty to the supplier that first supplies them with a particular product or technology, our competitors may have an advantage over us with respect to such products and technologies. Additionally, many of our competitors have, and will continue to have, greater research and development, marketing, financial and other resources than us and, therefore, represent and will continue to represent significant competition in our anticipated markets. As a result of their size and the breadth of their product offering, certain of these companies have been and will be able to establish managed accounts by which, through a combination of direct computer links and volume discounts, they seek to gain a disproportionate share of orders for health care products and technologies from prospective customers. Such managed accounts present significant competitive barriers for us. It is anticipated that we will benefit from their participation in selected markets, which, as they expand, may attract the attention of our competitors. The business of research and development of pharmaceuticals is intensely competitive. Major companies with immense financial and personal resources are also engaged in this field.
 
The patents related to the substance Elafin expired in 2012. Elastase inhibitors such as Elafin have been under research and development in the pharmaceutical industry for decades. Currently, hundreds of related patents have been granted. Most of these substances are produced synthetically, and are not applicable in the treatment of human diseases. Currently two elastase inhibitors are used as pharmaceuticals, alpha-1-antitrypsin worldwide and Sivelestat in Japan and Korea.
 
Alpha-1-antitrypsin
 
Human blood naturally contains relatively large amounts of alpha-1-antitrypsin. Alpha-1-antitrypsin is and has been marketed for more than 20 years, currently by Grifols, CSL Behring, Baxter and Kamada as a plasma-derived product to supply patients with genetic deficiency of functional alpha-1-antitrypsin.
 
Sivelestat
 
Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., in Japan, has developed the synthetic elastase inhibitor Sivelestat. Ono received approval in 2002 to use Sivelestat as a drug for the indication "Amelioration of acute lung disease accompanying generalized inflammatory syndrome" in Japan and in Korea (Dong-A, Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul) in 2006.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
The Company is, and will continue to be, subject to governmental regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and other similar laws of general application, as to all of which we believe we are in material compliance. Any future change in, and the cost of compliance with, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company.
 
Because of the nature of our operations, the use of hazardous substances, and our ongoing research and development and manufacturing activities, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local and foreign laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacturing, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable governmental and environmental laws, rules, regulations and policies, there can be no assurance that the business, financial conditions, and results of operations of the Company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws, rules, regulations and policies, or by liability occurring because of any past or future releases or discharges of materials that could be hazardous.
 
Additionally, the clinical testing, manufacture, promotion and sale of a significant majority of the products and technologies of the Company, if those products and technologies are to be offered and sold in the United States, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States, principally the FDA and corresponding state regulatory agencies. Additionally, to the extent those products and technologies are to be offered and sold in markets other than the United States, the clinical testing, manufacture, promotion and sale of those products and technologies will be subject to similar regulation by corresponding foreign regulatory agencies. In general, the regulatory framework for biological health care products is more rigorous than for non-biological health care products. Generally, biological health care products must be shown to be safe, pure, potent and effective. There are numerous state and federal statutes and regulations that govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, distribution and promotion of biological health care products. Non-compliance with applicable governmental requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, seizures of products, total or partial suspension of product marketing, failure of the government to grant pre-market approval, withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recall and criminal prosecution.
 
PATENTS, LICENSES & ROYALTIES
 
On December 30, 2000, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Dr. Wiedow, which was amended by an Amendment Agreement to the License Agreement (the “Amendment”) dated December 23, 2008. These agreements enable the Company to develop, manufacture or sell Elafin. The Amendment modified the annual payments and also the royalty payment such that from the date of the Amendment the Company will not only pay Dr. Wiedow a three percent royalty on gross revenues from the Company's sale of products based on the licensed technology but also three percent of the license fees (including upfront and milestone payments and running royalties) received by the Company or its subsidiary from their sublicensing of the licensed technology. Pursuant to the License Agreement, as amended, Dr. Wiedow may terminate the License Agreement in the event of a breach which is not cured within 90 days following written notice of such breach. In addition, Dr. Wiedow may terminate the License Agreement immediately in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, insolvency, assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, assignment of all or substantially all of its assets, or failure to continue to develop Elafin. After any termination, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company will return all documents, information and data received by Dr. Wiedow and will immediately cease to develop, manufacture or sell Elafin. Please see Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, for financial information.
 
On November 15, 2004, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with ARTES Biotechnology GmbH ("ARTES"). This agreement enables the Company to economically produce Elafin on a large scale by using the sublicensed yeast HANSENULA POLYMORPHA as a high-performance expression system. Rhein Biotech GmbH ("Rhein") has licensed the yeast to ARTES, who in-turn sublicensed it to the Company. The agreement has a term of fifteen years with an annual license fee equal to the greater of 10,000 Euros or 2.5% royalties on the future sales of Elafin. Should the license agreement between Rhein and ARTES terminate, Rhein will assume the sublicense agreement with the Company under similar terms.

In August 2007, the Company's subsidiary entered into an agreement with Rhein Minapharm ("Minapharm") for clinical development, production and marketing of Elafin. The Company has granted Minapharm the nonexclusive right to market Elafin in Egypt and certain Middle Eastern and African countries. Under this agreement, the Company had received upfront payments and may receive additional milestone-payments upon Minapharm's attainment of certain clinical milestones as well as royalties on any future net product sales.
 
In May 2014, our subsidiary entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party (the “Development Agreement”). Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the party has agreed to support the development of the Company’s orphan medicinal product Tiprelestat (“Elafin”) by providing certain funding to the Company to assist with activities related to research, clinical testing, manufacturing, and preparation and submission of applications for regulatory approvals. The party made upfront payments to the Company and will make ongoing monthly payments toward the development of Elafin, which will provide the Company with total funds of EURO 3.5 million. In exchange, we will pay the party a share of the net sales of Elafin within the European Union, subject to an aggregate maximum cap. All payments received are non-refundable. Please see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K, for financial information.
