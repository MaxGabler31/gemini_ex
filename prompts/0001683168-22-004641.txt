ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company”, “Aethlon”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Aethlon Medical, Inc.
 
Overview and Corporate History
 
We are a medical technology company focused on developing products to diagnose and treat life and organ threatening diseases. The Aethlon Hemopurifier®, or Hemopurifier, is a clinical-stage immunotherapeutic device designed to combat cancer and life-threatening viral infections. In cancer, the Hemopurifier is designed to deplete the presence of circulating tumor-derived exosomes that promote immune suppression, seed the spread of metastasis and inhibit the benefit of leading cancer therapies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has designated the Hemopurifier as a “Breakthrough Device” for two independent indications:
 
·              the treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy, and with cancer types in which exosomes have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease; and
 
·              the treatment of life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies.
 
We believe the Hemopurifier can be a substantial advance in the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer through the clearance of exosomes that promote the growth and spread of tumors through multiple mechanisms. We are currently conducting a clinical trial in patients with advanced and metastatic head and neck cancer. We are initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors that are being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. As we advance our clinical trials, we are in close contact with our clinical sites to navigate and assess the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials and current timelines.
 
On October 4, 2019, the FDA approved our Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application to initiate an Early Feasibility Study, or EFS, of the Hemopurifier in patients with head and neck cancer in combination with standard of care pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The primary endpoint for the EFS, which is designed to enroll 10 to 12 subjects at a single center, is safety, with secondary endpoints including measures of exosome clearance and characterization, as well as response and survival rates. This study, which is being conducted at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has treated two patients and is in the process of recruiting additional patients. We are also in the process of designing other clinical trials in oncology.
 
We also believe the Hemopurifier can be part of the broad-spectrum treatment of life-threatening highly glycosylated, or carbohydrate coated, viruses that are not addressed with an already approved treatment. In small-scale or early feasibility human studies, the Hemopurifier has been used in the past to treat individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, hepatitis C, or HCV, and Ebola.
 
Additionally, in-vitro, the Hemopurifier has been demonstrated to capture Zika virus, Lassa virus, MERS-CoV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, smallpox virus, monkeypox virus, H1N1 swine flu virus, H5N1 bird flu virus, and the reconstructed Spanish flu virus of 1918. In several cases, these validations were conducted in collaboration with leading government or non-government research institutes.
 
On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement to our open IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in a New Feasibility Study. That study is designed to enroll up to 40 subjects at up to 20 centers in the U.S. Subjects will have established laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, be admitted to an intensive care unit, or ICU, and will have acute lung injury and/or severe or life threatening disease, among other criteria. Endpoints for this study, in addition to safety, include reduction in circulating virus, as well as clinical outcomes (NCT # 04595903). In June 2022, the first patient in this study was enrolled and has completed the Hemopurifier treatment phase of the protocol.
 
Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations, the Company has also treated three patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier.

In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with PPD, Inc., or PPD, a leading global contract research organization, or CRO, to oversee our U.S. clinical studies investigating the Hemopurifier for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We now have nine fully activated hospitals for patient enrollment and they are actively screening patients for the trial. These hospitals include LSU Shreveport, Valley Baptist Medical Center in Texas, Loma Linda Medical Center, Hoag Irvine and Newport Beach in Southern California, University of California Davis, University of Miami Medical Center, Cooper Medical and Thomas Jefferson Medical Center. We are in the site activation process with additional U.S. medical centers.
 
We also obtained ethics review board approval and entered into a clinical trial agreement with Medanta Medicity Hospital, a multi-specialty hospital in Delhi NCR, India, for a COVID-19 clinical trial at that location. We have completed all site initiation activities at Medanta Medicity Hospital and this site is now open for enrollment and is actively screening patients. One patient recently has completed participation in the study.
 
We are also the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc., or ESI. We consolidate ESI in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Successful outcomes of human trials will also be required by the regulatory agencies of certain foreign countries where we plan to sell the Hemopurifier. Some of our patents may expire before FDA approval or approval in a foreign country, if any, is obtained. However, we believe that certain patent applications and/or other patents issued more recently will help protect the proprietary nature of the Hemopurifier treatment technology.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we are monitoring closely the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business and have taken steps designed to protect the health and safety of our employees, while continuing our operations. Given the level of uncertainty regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary environment on capital markets and the U.S. economy, we are unable to assess the impact of the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic, political change, and general economic uncertainty, on our timelines and future access to capital. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, clinical trials, and preclinical research will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, as well as the economic impact on national and international markets.
 
We were formed on March 10, 1999. Our executive offices are located at 11555 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite 203, San Diego, California 92121. Our telephone number is (619) 941-0360. Our website address is www.aethlonmedical.com.
 
The Mechanism of the Hemopurifier
 
The Hemopurifier is an affinity hemofiltration device designed for the single-use removal of exosomes and life-threatening viruses from the human circulatory system. In the United States, the Hemopurifier is classified as a combination product whose regulatory jurisdiction is The Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, the branch of FDA responsible for the premarket approval of all medical devices.
 
In our current applications, our Hemopurifier can be used on the established infrastructure of continuous renal replacement therapy, or CRRT, and dialysis instruments located in hospitals and clinics worldwide. It could also potentially be developed as part of a proprietary closed system with its own pump and tubing set, negating the requirement for dialysis infrastructure. Incorporated within the Hemopurifier is a protein called a lectin that binds to a glycosylated, or sugar substituted, membrane, which exosomes and most infectious viruses share.

The Hemopurifier - Clinical Trials In Viral Infections
    The initial development of the Hemopurifier was focused on viral infections. In non-clinical bench experiments using a laboratory version of the Hemopurifier, performed in Company labs as well as multiple other outside labs including the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, or USAMRIID, Battelle Memorial Research Institute and others, we have demonstrated that the a miniature version of the Hemopurifier can bind and clear multiple different glycosylated, or containing sugar molecules on their membranes, viruses. These viruses include HIV, HCV, Dengue, West Nile, multiple strains of influenza, Ebola, Chikungunya, smallpox, monkeypox, multiple herpes viruses, a MERS-CoV related pseudovirus and others.
 
Initial clinical trials on the Hemopurifier were conducted overseas on dialysis patients with HCV, with a subsequent EFS conducted in the U.S. under an FDA approved Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE.
 
On March 13, 2017, we concluded an FDA-approved EFS under an IDE in end stage renal disease patients on dialysis who were infected with HCV. The study was conducted at DaVita MedCenter Dialysis in Houston, Texas. We reported that there were no device-related adverse events in enrolled subjects who met the study inclusion-exclusion criteria. We also reported that an average capture of 154 million copies of HCV (in International Units, I.U.) within the Hemopurifier during four-hour treatments. Prior to this approval, we collected supporting Hemopurifier data through investigational human studies conducted overseas.
 
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19

SARS-COV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family, which includes the original SARS virus, SARS-CoV, and the MERS virus. SARS-CoV-2, like all coronaviruses, is glycosylated. This suggests that the Hemopurifier could potentially clear it from biologic fluids, including blood.
 
On June 17, 2020, the FDA approved a supplement to our open IDE for the Hemopurifier in viral disease to allow for the testing of the Hemopurifier in patients with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in a New Feasibility Study. That study is designed to enroll up to 40 subjects at up to 20 centers in the U.S. Subjects will have established laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, be admitted to an intensive care unit, or ICU, and will have acute lung injury and/or severe or life threatening disease, among other criteria. Endpoints for this study, in addition to safety, include reduction in circulating virus, as well as clinical outcomes (NCT # 04595903). In June 2022, the Company completed the treatment protocol for its first patient in this study.
 
In September 2021, we entered into an agreement with PPD, Inc., or PPD, a leading global contract research organization, or CRO, to oversee our U.S. clinical studies investigating the Hemopurifier for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We now have nine hospitals activated for patient enrollment and they are actively screening patients for the trial. These hospitals include LSU Shreveport, Valley Baptist Medical Center in Texas, Loma Linda Medical Center, Hoag, Irvine and Newport Beach in Southern California, University of California Davis, University of Miami Medical Center, and Thomas Jefferson Medical Center. We are in the site activation process with additional U.S. medical centers.


Under Single Patient Emergency Use regulations, the Company has also treated three patients with COVID-19 with the Hemopurifier. The Company recently published a manuscript reviewing case studies covering those treatments entitled “Removal of COVID-19 Spike Protein, Whole Virus, Exosomes and Exosomal microRNAs by the Hemopurifier® Lectin-Affinity Cartridge in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 Infection.”
 
The manuscript described the use of the Hemopurifier for a total of nine sessions in two critically ill COVID-19 patients. The first case study demonstrated the improvement in the patient who was a SARS-COV-2 positive COVID-19 present at entry to the hospital, with associated coagulopathy, or CAC, lung injury, inflammation, and tissue injury despite the absence of demonstrable COVID-19 viremia at the start of treatment at Day 22 and having demonstrated strong viremia earlier in the patient’s disease cycle, suggesting that the significant removal of exosomes contributed to the patient’s recovery. This patient received eight Hemopurifier treatments without complications and eventually was weaned from a ventilator and was discharged from the hospital.

The second patient case study demonstrated in vivo removal of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the blood stream of an infected patient. This patient completed a six-hour Hemopurifier treatment without complications and subsequently was placed on CRRT. The patient ultimately expired three hours after being placed on CRRT because of the advanced stage of the patient’s disease.
 
In May 2022, we announced the publication of a pre-print manuscript featuring data that demonstrated Aethlon's proprietary GNA affinity resin was able to bind seven clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including the Delta and Omicron variants. Viral capture efficiency with the GNA affinity resin ranged from 53% to 89% for all variants tested. The GNA affinity resin is a key component of the Aethlon Hemopurifier®. The manuscript is titled "Removal of Clinically Relevant SARS-CoV-2 Variants by An Affinity Resin Containing Galanthus nivalis Agglutinin" and was published in bioRxiv. 
 
We previously commissioned Battelle Memorial Institute in 2008 to run a monkeypox virus, or MPV, in vitro study using a mini-Hemopurifier. This study demonstrated that high concentrations of MPV (approximately 35 thousand cpu/ml) were rapidly depleted from cell culture fluids when circulated through the Hemopurifier. The study data indicated that the Hemopurifier removed 44 percent of infectious MPV in the first hour of testing, 82 percent after six hours, and 98 percent after 20 hours. The studies were conducted in triplicate and data verification was provided by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Given recent outbreaks of MPV, we plan to continue to monitor the MPV outbreak, which has not yet been declared an emergency by the DHHS Secretary.


The Hemopurifier – Clinical Trials Conducted Overseas in Viral Infections
 
EBOLA Virus
 
In December of 2014, Time Magazine named the Hemopurifier a “Top 25 Invention” as the result of treating an Ebola-infected physician at Frankfurt University Hospital in Germany. The physician was comatose with multiple organ failure at the time of treatment with the Hemopurifier. At the American Society of Nephrology Annual Meeting, Dr. Helmut Geiger, Chief of Nephrology at Frankfurt University Hospital reported that the patient received a single 6.5 hour Hemopurifier treatment. Prior to treatment, viral load was measured at 400,000 copies/ml. Post-treatment viral load reported to be at 1,000 copies/ml. Dr. Geiger also reported that 242 million copies of Ebola virus were captured within the Hemopurifier during treatment. The patient ultimately made a full recovery. Based on this experience, the Company filed an Expanded Access protocol with the FDA to treat Ebola virus infected patients in up to ten centers in the U.S. and a corresponding protocol was approved by HealthCanada. These protocols remain open allowing Hemopurifier treatment to be offered to patients presenting for care in both countries. In 2018, we applied for and were granted a Breakthrough Designation by the FDA “… for the treatment of life-threatening viruses that are not addressed with approved therapies.”
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
 
Prior to FDA approval of the IDE feasibility study, we conducted investigational HCV treatment studies at the Apollo Hospital, Fortis Hospital and the Medanta Medicity Institute in India. In the Medanta Medicity Institute study, 12 HCV-infected individuals were enrolled to receive three six-hour Hemopurifier treatments during the first three days of a 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin treatment regimen. The study was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Vijay Kher. Dr. Kher’s staff reported that Hemopurifier therapy was well tolerated and without device-related adverse events in the 12 treated patients.
 
Of these 12 patients, ten completed the Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin treatment protocol, including eight genotype-1 patients and two genotype-3 patients. Eight of the ten patients achieved a sustained virologic response, which is the clinical definition of treatment cure and is defined as undetectable HCV in the blood 24 weeks after the completion of the 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin drug regimen. Both genotype-3 patients achieved a sustained virologic response, while six of the eight genotype-1 patients achieved a sustained virologic response, which defines a cure of the infection.

Hemopurifier - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
 
In addition to treating Ebola and HCV-infected individuals, we also conducted a single proof-of-principle treatment study at the Sigma New Life Hospital in an AIDS patient who was not being administered HIV antiviral drugs. In the study, viral load was reduced by 93% as the result of 12 Hemopurifier treatments (each four hours in duration) that were administered over the course of one month.
The Hemopurifier in Cancer
 
While hepatitis C is no longer a major commercial opportunity in developed markets due to the wide availability of curative, oral direct acting anti-viral agents, we continue to investigate potential viral targets for the Hemopurifier. Recently, however, our primary focus has been on the evaluation of the Hemopurifier in cancer, where we have previously shown in non-clinical studies and in a recent COVID-19 emergency use patient that it is capable of clearing exosomes, which are subcellular particles that are secreted by both normal and malignant cells. Tumor derived exosomes, have been shown in multiple laboratories to be critical components in the progression of cancers. They can mediate resistance to chemotherapy, resistance to targeted agents such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), metastasis and resistance to the newer immuno-oncology agents, such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Based on these observations and data, in November 2019 the FDA granted us a second Breakthrough Designation “…for the treatment of individuals with advanced or metastatic cancer who are either unresponsive to or intolerant of standard of care therapy, and with cancer types in which exosomes have been shown to participate in the development or severity of the disease.”
 
On October 4, 2019, the FDA approved our IDE application to initiate an EFS of the Hemopurifier in patients with head and neck cancer in combination with standard of care pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The primary endpoint for the EFS, which is designed to enroll 10 to 12 subjects at a single center, is safety, with secondary endpoints including measures of exosome clearance and characterization, as well as response and survival rates. This study, which is being conducted at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been approved by the IRB and is in the process of recruiting and treating patients.
 
U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
 
We have recognized revenue under the following government contracts/grants over the past two years:
 
Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract
 
On September 12, 2019, the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, awarded to us an SBIR Phase II Award Contract, for NIH/NCI Topic 359, entitled “A Device Prototype for Isolation of Melanoma Exosomes for Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring”, or the Award Contract. The Award Contract amount is $1,860,561 and, as amended, runs for the period from September 16, 2019 through September 15, 2022.
 
The work performed pursuant to this Award Contract focused on melanoma exosomes. This work follows from our completion of a Phase I contract for the Topic 359 solicitation that ran from September 2017 through June 2018. Following on the Phase I work, the deliverables in the Phase II program involved the design and testing of a pre-commercial prototype of a more advanced version of the exosome isolation platform.
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we recorded $229,698 of government contract revenue on the Award Contract. That revenue related to work performed in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 that had previously been recorded as deferred revenue as a result of falling short on certain milestones. We then achieved those March period milestones in the June quarter and the June period milestones in the September quarter and therefore recorded the previously deferred revenue as government contract revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2021. We recorded the invoices related to the September 30, 2021, December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 periods as deferred revenue, since we fell short of certain milestones related to those periods.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we completed the milestones relevant to the first nine months of the fiscal year and, as a result, we recorded $436,427 of government contract revenue on the Phase 2 Melanoma Cancer Contract in that fiscal year.
 
Subaward with University of Pittsburgh
 
In 2020, we entered into a cost reimbursable subaward arrangement with the University of Pittsburgh in connection with an NIH contract entitled “Depleting Exosomes to Improve Responses to Immune Therapy in HNNCC.” Our share of the award is $256,750. We recorded $64,467 and $34,233 of revenue related to this subaward in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31. 2021, respectively.
 
Research and Development Costs
 
A substantial portion of our operating budget is used for research and development activities. The cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operations, amounted to approximately $2,341,000 and $2,072,000 in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
We currently own or have license rights to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications and endeavor to continually improve our intellectual property position. We consider the protection of our technology, whether owned or licensed, to the exclusion of use by others, to be vital to our business. While we intend to focus primarily on patented or patentable technology, we also rely on trade secrets, unpatented property, know-how, regulatory exclusivity, patent extensions and continuing technological innovation to develop our competitive position. We also own certain trademarks.
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology, including the Hemopurifier product platform, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, licensing agreements and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to avoid infringing patents issued to others. If we were judicially determined to be infringing on any third-party patent, we could be required to pay damages, alter our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease sales of products or certain activities.
 
To protect our proprietary medical technologies, including the Hemopurifier product platform and other scientific discoveries, we have a portfolio of over 50 issued patents and pending applications worldwide. We currently have five issued U.S. patents and 43 issued patents in countries outside of the United States. In addition, we have nine patent applications pending worldwide related to our Hemopurifier product platform and other technologies. We are seeking additional patents on our scientific discoveries.
 
It is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, that we will not develop additional proprietary products that are patentable, that any patents issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or will be challenged by third parties and that the patents of others may prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents. U.S. patent applications are not immediately made public, so it is possible that a third party may obtain a patent on a technology we are actively using.

There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and declared invalid or unenforceable. For many of our pending applications, patent interference proceedings may be instituted with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO’s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delays in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us.  Third parties can file post-grant proceedings in the USPTO, seeking to have issued patent invalidated, within nine months of issuance. This means that patents undergoing post-grant proceedings may be lost, or some or all claims may require amendment or cancellation, if the outcome of the proceedings is unfavorable to us. Post-grant proceedings are complex and could result in a reduction or loss of patent rights. The institution of post-grant proceedings against our patents could also result in significant expenses.
 
Patent law outside the United States is uncertain and in many countries, is currently undergoing review and revisions. The laws of some countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of patents to us in foreign countries by initiating opposition proceedings. Opposition proceedings against any of our patent filings in a foreign country could have an adverse effect on our corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the United States. It may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our patents or our competitors’ patents that have been issued in countries other than the United States. This could result in substantial costs, divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Outside of the United States, we currently have pending patent applications or issued patents in Europe, India, Russia, Canada and Hong Kong.
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. It is possible that others could independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent technology, somehow gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise or disclose such trade secrets, or that we may not successfully ultimately protect our rights to such unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We rely, in part, on confidentiality agreements with our marketing partners, employees, advisors, vendors and consultants to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our unpatented trade secrets and proprietary technological expertise will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.

Industry & Competition
 
The industry for treating infectious disease and cancer is extremely competitive, and companies developing new treatment procedures face significant capital and regulatory challenges. As our Hemopurifier is a clinical-stage device, we have the additional challenge of establishing medical industry support, which will be driven by treatment data resulting from human clinical studies. Should our device become market cleared by the FDA or the regulatory body of another country, we may face significant competition from well-funded pharmaceutical organizations. Additionally, we would likely need to establish large-scale production of our device in order to be competitive. We believe that our Hemopurifier is a first-in-class therapeutic candidate and we are not aware of any affinity hemofiltration device being market cleared in any country for the single-use removal of circulating viruses or tumor-derived exosomes.
Government Regulation
 
The Hemopurifier is subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, primarily the FDA, and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting of medical devices. As the primary mode of action of the Hemopurifier is attributable to the device component of this combination product, the CDRH has primary jurisdiction over its premarket development, review and approval. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a pre-market approval from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a premarket approval, or PMA, is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in orders to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner. We believe that the Hemopurifier will be classified as a Class III device and as such will be subject to PMA submission and approval.

Pre-market Approval Pathway 
 
A pre-market approval application must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which the FDA has required a PMA. The pre-market approval application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) pre-market notification process. A pre-market approval application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.
 
After a pre-market approval application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed pre-market approval application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
 
Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
 
Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
 
Emergency Use Authorizations, or EUAs, are granted by FDA in public health emergencies but allow use of the authorized device only during the period of the respective public health emergency, and do not change the requirement to ultimately seek PMA approval after the authorization period has ended.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product.

Ongoing Regulation by the FDA

Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

· | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs.
 
Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

· | warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | criminal prosecution.

The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
 
Healthcare Regulation

In addition to the FDA’s restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, the U.S. healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include: the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws; federal data privacy and security laws; and federal transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals. Many states have similar laws and regulations that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payor. In addition, state data privacy laws that protect the security of health information may differ from each other and may not be preempted by federal law. Moreover, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, report information related to drug pricing, require the registration of sales representatives, and prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing and other activities with respect to any product candidate for which we receive approval to market in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities, particularly any sales and marketing activities after a product candidate has been approved for marketing in the United States, could be subject to legal challenge and enforcement actions. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. For example, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, ACA, among other things, reduced and/or limited Medicare reimbursement to certain providers and imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions. However, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, this ACA-mandated medical device tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by subsequent legislation, further reduces Medicare’s payments to providers by two percent through fiscal year 2030. However, COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the two percent Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. These reductions may reduce providers’ revenues or profits, which could affect their ability to purchase new technologies. Furthermore, the healthcare industry in the U.S. has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. In July 2021, the Biden Administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” which contained provisions relating to prescription drugs. On September 9, 2021, in response to this executive order, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives.
 
Legislation could be adopted in the future that limits payments for our products from governmental payors. It is possible that additional governmental action will be taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, commercial payors such as insurance companies, could adopt similar policies that limit reimbursement for medical device manufacturers’ products.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
In both the U.S. and international markets, the use of medical devices is dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Healthcare providers that use medical devices generally rely on third-party payors to pay for all or part of the costs and fees associated with the medical procedures being performed or to compensate them for their patient care services. Should our Hemopurifier or any other products under development be approved for commercialization by the FDA, any such products may not be considered cost-effective, reimbursement may not be available in the U.S. or other countries, if approved, and reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow sales of our future products on a profitable basis. The coverage decisions of third-party payors will be significantly influenced by the assessment of our future products by health technology assessment bodies. If approved for use in the U.S., we expect that any products that we develop, including the Hemopurifier, will be purchased primarily by medical institutions, which will in turn bill various third-party payors for the health care services provided to patients at their facility. Payors may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, other government programs and private insurance plans. The process involved in applying for coverage and reimbursement from CMS is lengthy and expensive. Further, Medicare coverage is based on our ability to demonstrate that the treatment is “reasonable and necessary” for Medicare beneficiaries. Even if products utilizing our Aethlon Hemopurifier technology receive FDA and other regulatory clearance or approval, they may not be granted coverage and reimbursement by any payor, including by CMS. Many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies and amounts. However, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for medical devices exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
Manufacturing
 
Manufacturing of our Hemopurifier occurs in collaboration with a contract manufacturer based in California under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations promulgated by the FDA. Our contract manufacturer is registered with the FDA. To date, our manufacture of the Hemopurifier has been limited to quantities necessary to support our clinical studies.
 
Our costs of compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws have been immaterial to date.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers 
 
Our Hemopurifiers are currently assembled by Aethlon personnel in a cGMP manufacturing facility provided by Life Science Outsourcing, Inc, or LSO. In the future, we plan to bring our manufacturing operations in-house. Aethlon personnel assemble the various components of the Hemopurifier with materials from our various suppliers, which are purchased and released by Aethlon and stored at LSO prior to use in manufacturing. Specifically, the Hemopurifier contains three critical components with limited available suppliers. The base cartridge on which the Hemopurifier is constructed is sourced from Medica S.p.A and we are dependent on the continued availability of these cartridges. Although there are other suppliers, the process of qualifying a new supplier takes time and regulatory approvals must be obtained. We currently purchase the diatomaceous earth from Janus Scientific, Inc., as the distributor; however, the product is manufactured by Imerys Minerals Ltd. There potentially are other suppliers of this product, but as with the cartridges, qualifying and obtaining required regulatory approvals takes time and resources. The GNA lectin is sourced from Vector Laboratories Inc. and also is available from other suppliers; however, Sigma Aldrich is the only approved back up supplier at this time. A business interruption at any of these sources could have a material impact on our ability to manufacture the Hemopurifier.
  
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not currently have any sales and marketing capability. With respect to commercialization efforts in the future, we intend to build or contract for distribution, sales and marketing capabilities for any product candidate that is approved. From time to time, we have had and are having strategic discussions with potential collaboration partners for our product candidates, although no assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements for our product candidates on acceptable terms, if at all.
Product Liability
 
The risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products. We have limited clinical trial liability insurance coverage. It is possible that future insurance coverage may not be adequate or available. We may not be able to secure product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. Any liability for mandatory damages could exceed the amount of our coverage. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates.
Employees
 
We have 14 full-time employees. All of our employees are located in the United States. We do intend to hire additional employees. We utilize, whenever appropriate, consultants in order to conserve cash and resources.
 
We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
