Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

(a) Business Development
 
The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 19, 2009, under its current name. The Company was a development stage company with the goal of becoming a design, engineer, construct, market and sell high-quality PV SEFs for commercial and utility applications to local markets.
 
Prior to June 1, 2012, we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metal-bearing mineral deposits. On June 1, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Xunyang Yongjin Mining Co., Ltd. to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment. Further, on December 30, 2013, our subsidiary, Shaanxi Changjiang Mining & New Energy Co., Ltd ("Shaanxi Changjiang"), entered into Equity Transfer Agreements with officers of the Company, whereby the Company’s subsidiaries were sold off.
 
Business operations for China Chingjiang Mining & New Energy Energy Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries were abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced in 2020. The Company filed its last 10-Q in 2017, this financial report included liabilities and debts. As of the date of this filing, these liabilities and debts have not been addressed and remain on the Company’s books.
 
On February 3, 2020, the Eighth District Court of Clark County, Nevada granted the Application for Appointment of Custodian as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation of the Company’s charter. The order appointed Small Cap Compliance, LLC (“SCC”) custodian with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize new classes of stock. 
 
The court awarded custodianship to Small Cap Compliance, LLC (sole member is Rhonda Keaveney) based on the absence of a functioning board of directors, revocation of the company’s charter, and abandonment of the business. At this time, Ms. Keaveney was appointed sole officer and director.
 
The Company was severely delinquent in filing annual reports for the Company’s charter. The last annual report was filed on 12/31/2015 in on Form 10-K. In addition, the company was subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements including filing 10Q’s and 10Ks. The Company filed its last 10Q for quarter ending 6/30/2017 and was out of compliance with Exchange Act reporting. SCC attempted to contact the Company’s officers and directors through letters, emails and phone calls, with no success.
 
SCC was a shareholder in the Company and applied to the Court for an Order appointing SCC as the Custodian. This application was for the purpose of reinstating CHYL’s corporate charter to do business and restoring value to the Company for the benefit of the stockholders.
 
SCC performed the following actions in its capacity as custodian:
 

· | Funded any expenses of the company including paying off outstanding liabilities 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Brought the Company back into compliance with the Nevada Secretary of State, resident agent, transfer agent 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Appointed officers and directors and held a shareholders meeting 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Nevada Secretary of State for reinstatement of the Company, $5,675
 Transfer agent, Island Stock Transfer, $6,500

Upon appointment as custodian of CHJI and under its duties stipulated by the Nevada court, SCC took initiative to organize the business of the issuer. As custodian, the duties were to conduct daily business, hold shareholder meetings, appoint officers and directors, reinstate the company with the Nevada Secretary of State. SCC also had authority to enter into contracts and find a suitable merger candidate. SCC was compensated for its role as custodian in the amount of 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Series C Preferred Stock.

On August 23, 2020, SCC entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Bridgeview Capital Partners, LLC whereby Bridgeview Capital Partners, LLC purchased 1,000,000 shares of Convertible Series C Preferred Stock. These shares represent the controlling block of stock.

We are currently a shell company, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Rule 12b-2.
 
(b) Business of Issuer
 
China Changjiang Mining & New Energy Co., Ltd. is a developmental stage company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 19, 2009. Our plan of business has not been implemented but will incorporate exploration, development, and sales of crude oil, as well as conducting industry analysis related to the petroleum industry.
 
At present, we have not implemented our business plan and financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital in order to fund the project.
 
All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented as of this filing.
 
The Company is moving in a new direction, statements made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have no history of performance. Current management does not have any experience in these industries but is actively looking for a suitable person to incorporate into the management team.
 
We feel that our business plan addresses the need for additional development in the mining industry of oil and gas.

China’s oil industry is regulated by the People’s Republic of China under the Mineral Resources Law. The Company will follow all prescribed regulation.
 
The Company intends to implement its business plan upon raising capital. Subject to available capital, the oil and gas extraction industry can be classified into four major categories:
 
Exploration
 

· | search for rock formations associated with oil or natural gas deposits 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | geophysical prospecting and/or exploratory drilling 
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Well Development
 

· | construction of one or more wells from the beginning 
--+---------------------------------------------------------

Production
 

· | process of extracting the hydrocarbons and separating the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, gas, water, and solids, removing the constituents that are non-saleable, and selling the liquid hydrocarbons and gas 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Site Abandonment
 

· | plugging the well(s) and restoring the site when a recently-drilled well lacks the potential to produce economic quantities of oil or gas, or when a production well is no longer economically viable 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and enter into any definitive agreement with buyers of our product. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented its business plan.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.

We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective mining venture that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
Our company expects to compete in in the oil and gas industry. We will compete in global markets where countries such the USA, Saudi Arabia, and Canada out produce China in oil production. In addition, there are several competitors in China that are larger and more profitable than CHJI. We expect that the quantity and composition of our competitive environment will continue to evolve as the industry matures. Additionally, increased competition is possible to the extent that new geographies enter the marketplace as a result of continued enactment of regulatory and legislative changes. We believe that diligently establishing and expanding our funding sources will establish us in an already established industry. Additionally, we expect that establishing our product offerings on new platforms are factors that mitigate the risk associated with operating in a developing competitive environment. Additionally, the contemporaneous growth of the industry as a whole will result in new customers entering the marketplace, thereby further mitigating the impact of competition on our future operations and results.
 
Compliance with oil and gas standards will increase development costs and the cost of products sold in the retail market. In turn, we may not be able to meet the competitive price point dictated by the market and our competitors.
 
Again, these are forward looking statements and not an indication of past performance. There is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan, however, we have a merger candidate, Inner Mongolia Hongyuan Fengtai Resources Development Co., Ltd. (“IMHF”).
 
Founded on July 19, 2006 and located in New Baolage Town, Xianghuang Banner, Inner Mongolia Hongyuan Fengtai Resources Development Co., Ltd. (Hongfeng) is a limited liability company focusing on energy investment. The company is currently engaged in the exploration, development, and sales of crude oil, as well as conducting industry analysis related to the petroleum industry. The company’s business can be defined as conducting the midstream exploration and development (exploitation) in the petroleum industry. Government protection set up has high barriers for potential competitors to entry. Hongfeng has an operating team of the top crude oil extraction experts with overseas management experience. With fully automated mining equipment and regular maintenance, the company keeps safe (no operating accident in 14 years) and high efficiency at the same time.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Upon effectiveness of this Form 10, we will be subject to the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under the Exchange Act, we will be required to file with the SEC annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act creates a strong and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also (1) requires steps be taken to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; (2) establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; (3) creates guidelines for audit committee members’ appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies’ auditors; (4) prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and (5) establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions.
 
We will also be subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A. Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.
 
We are also subject to subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, based on the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO). All SEC reporting companies, other than those who file under the Canada-U.S. Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS), will be required to comply with the new rules for their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021.
 
 Lastly, we are also subject to the People’s Republic of China under the Mineral Resources Law many other China regulatory agencies. The Mineral Resources Law oversees the area of developing the oil industry, promoting the exploration, development, utilization and protection of mineral resources and ensuring the present and long-term needs of the socialist modernization program.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had one officer and no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to begin implementing our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
