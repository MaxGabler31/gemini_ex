Item 1. | Business
---------+---------

 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 3, 2004 and commenced operations on January 1, 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 1250 Broadway, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10001. For convenience in this report, the terms “Company,” “Varonis,” “we” and “us” may be used to refer to Varonis Systems, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries, except where indicated otherwise. Our telephone number is (877) 292-8767.
 
Overview 
 
Varonis is a pioneer in data security and analytics, fighting a different battle than conventional cybersecurity companies. We are pioneers because over a decade ago, we recognized that enterprise capacity to create and share data far exceeded its capacity to protect it. We believed the vast movement of information from analog to digital mediums combined with increasing information dependence would change both the global economy and the risk profiles of corporations and governments. Since then our focus has been on using innovation to address the cyber-implications of this movement, creating software that provides ways to track and protect data wherever it is stored.
 
Our software allows enterprises to protect data stored on premises and in the cloud: sensitive files and emails; confidential customer, patient and employee data; financial records; strategic and product plans; and other intellectual property. Recognizing the complexities of securing data, we have built a single integrated platform for security and analytics to simplify and streamline security and data management.
 
The Varonis Data Security Platform, built on patented technology, allows enterprises to protect data against insider threats and cyberattacks. Our products enable enterprises to analyze data, account activity and user behavior to detect attacks. Our Data Security Platform prevents or limits unauthorized use of sensitive information, prevents potential cyberattacks and limits others by locking down sensitive and stale data. Our product efficiently sustains a secure state with automation and addresses additional use cases including governance, compliance, classification and threat analytics. Our Data Security Platform is driven by a proprietary technology, the Metadata Framework, that extracts critical metadata, or data about data, from an enterprise’s IT infrastructure. Our Data Security Platform uses this contextual information to map functional relationships among employees, data objects, content and usage.
 
The revolution in internet search occurred when search engines began to mine internet metadata, such as the links between pages, in addition to page content, thereby making the internet’s content more usable and consequently more valuable. Similarly, our Data Security Platform creates advanced searchable data structures out of available content and metadata, providing real-time intelligence about an enterprise’s massive volumes of data, making it more accessible, manageable and secured.
 
We believe that the technology underlying our Data Security Platform is our primary competitive advantage. The strength of our solution is driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed, coupled with how we have combined them into our highly versatile platform. Our belief in our technological advantage stems from us having developed a way to do each of the following:
 

• | determine relevant metadata and security information to capture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | capture that metadata without imposing any strains or latencies on the enterprise’s computing infrastructure;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | modify that metadata in a way that makes it comparable and analyzable despite it having originated from disparate IT systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create supplemental metadata, as needed, when the existing IT infrastructure’s activity logs are not sufficient;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | decipher the key functional relationships of metadata, the underlying data, and its creators;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | use those functional relationships to create a graphical depiction, or map, of the data that will endure as enterprises add large volumes of data to their network and storage resources on a daily basis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analyze the data and related metadata utilizing sophisticated algorithms, including cluster analyses and machine learning;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | visualize and depict the analyses in an intuitive manner, including simulating contemplated changes and automatically execute tasks that are normally manually intensive for IT and business personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identify and classify the data as sensitive, critical, private or regulated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | automate changes to directory service objects and access controls on large file systems;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | detect suspicious user behavior and unusual file and email activity using deep analysis of metadata, machine learning and user behavior analytics; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | generate meaningful, actionable alerts when security-related incidents are detected.

The broad applicability of our technology has resulted in our customers deploying our platform for numerous use cases. These use cases include: discovery and classification of high-risk, sensitive data; centralized visibility into enterprise data, user behavior and file activity; security monitoring and risk reduction; data breach, insider threat, malware and ransomware detection; data ownership identification; reporting and auditing with searchable logs; meeting security policy and compliance regulation; data migration; and intelligent archiving.
 
We sell substantially all of our products and services to channel partners, including distributors and resellers, which sell to end-user customers, which we refer to in this report as our customers. We believe that our sales model, which combines the leverage of a channel sales model with our highly trained and professional sales force, has played and will continue to play a major role in our ability to grow and to successfully deliver our unique value proposition for enterprise data. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,250 customers, spanning leading firms in the financial services, healthcare, public, industrial, insurance, energy and utilities, consumer and retail, education, media and entertainment and technology sectors.
 
Size of Our Market Opportunity 
 
The International Data Corporation’s Data Age 2025: The Evolution of Data to Life-Critical study estimates that the amount of data created in the world will grow to 163 Zettabytes (or 151 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, representing a nearly tenfold increase from the amount created in 2016. They estimate that nearly 20% of that data will be critical to our daily lives (and nearly 10% hypercritical). The study also suggests that by 2025, almost 90% of all data will require a meaningful level of security, but less than half will be secured. Every enterprise and government will almost certainly require new technologies to protect and manage data.
 
We believe that the diverse functionalities offered by our platform position us at the intersection of several powerful trends in the digital enterprise data universe. We believe that the business intelligence and functionalities delivered by our platform define a new market, and we are not aware of any third party studies that accurately define our addressable market.  The functionality of our software platform overlaps with portions of several established and growing enterprise software markets as defined by Gartner, Inc. in 2017, including security software ($23.6 billion), IT operations management ($23.3 billion), storage management ($15.2 billion), infrastructure software ($10.0 billion) and data integration ($4.5 billion). We believe that our comprehensive product offering will attract a meaningful portion of this overall spend, estimating that our total addressable market is approximately 20% of these combined markets, or $15 billion dollars.
 
Our Technology 
 
Our proprietary technology extracts critical information about an enterprise’s data and uses this contextual information, or metadata, to create a functional map of an enterprise’s data and underlying file systems. Our Metadata Framework technology has been architected to process large volumes of enterprise data and the related metadata at a massive scale with minimal demands on the existing IT infrastructure. All of our products, except DatAnywhere, utilize our Data Security Platform and a core single codebase, thereby streamlining our product development initiatives.
Key Benefits of Our Technology 
 
Protect Data from Insider Threats, Data Breaches and Cyberattacks. Our solutions analyze how employee accounts, service accounts and admin accounts use and access data, profile employees’ roles and file contents, baseline “normal” behavior patterns, and alert on significant deviations from profiled behaviors. Our customers are able to detect rogue insiders, attackers that have compromised internal systems and employee accounts, malware and other significant threats.
Comprehensive Solution for Managing and Protecting Enterprise Data. Our products enable a broad range of functionality, including data governance, secure search and remote collaboration and intelligent retention—all from one core technology platform. Moreover, our platform is applicable across all major enterprise data stores (Windows, UNIX/Linux, Intranets, email systems and Office365).
Security Analytics with User, Data and System Context. Our solutions combine classification and data access governance with User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UBA) for accurate detection and risk reduction. Our solutions discover, identify and classify sensitive, critical and regulated data to help meet regulatory compliance and sustainably reduce risk relating to unauthorized use and cyberattacks.
Fast Time to Value and Low Total Cost of Ownership. Our solutions do not require custom implementations or long deployment cycles. Our Data Security Platform can be installed and ready for use within hours and allows customers to realize real value within days of implementation. We designed our platform to operate on commodity hardware with standard operating systems, further reducing the cost of ownership of our product.
Ease of Use. While we utilize complex data structures and algorithms in our data engine, we abstract that complexity to provide a sleek, intuitive interface. Our software is accessible through either the local client or a standard web browser and requires limited training, saving on time and cost and making it accessible to the broader set of non-technical users.

Highly Scalable and Flexible Data Engine. Our metadata analysis technology is built to be highly scalable and flexible, allowing our customers to analyze vast amounts of enterprise data. Moreover, our proprietary Metadata Framework is built with a modular architecture, allowing customers to grow into the full capabilities of our solution over time.
Our Growth Strategy 
 
Our objective is to be the primary vendor to which enterprises turn to analyze and protect their data. The following are key elements of our growth strategy.
Extend Our Technological Capabilities Through Innovation. We intend to increase our current level of investment in product development in order to enhance existing products to address new use cases and deliver new products. We believe that the flexibility, sophistication and broad applicability of our Metadata Framework will allow us to use this framework as the core of numerous future products built on our same core technology. Our ability to leverage our research and development resources has enabled us to create a new product development engine that we believe can proactively identify and solve enterprise needs.
Grow Our Customer Base. The unabated rise in enterprise data, ubiquitous reliance on digital collaboration and increased cybersecurity concerns will continue to drive demand for data collaboration, governance, retention and protection solutions. We intend to capitalize on this demand by targeting new customers, vertical markets and use cases for our solutions. Our solutions address the needs of customers of all sizes ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational companies with thousands of employees and petabytes of data. Although our solutions are applicable to organizations of all sizes, we will continue our focus on targeting larger organizations who can make larger purchases with us over time.
Increase Sales to Existing Customers. We believe significant opportunities exist to further expand relationships with existing customers. Data growth (and subsequent security concerns) continues across all the data stores, and enterprises wish to standardize on solutions that help them manage, protect and extract more value from their data wherever it is stored. We will continue to cultivate incremental sales from our existing customers by driving increased use of our software within our installed base by expanding footprint and usage. We currently have six product families, and, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 52% of our customers had purchased two or more product families. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given the broad platform of products we have and the growing volumes and complexity of enterprise data that our customers have. As we innovate and expand our product offering, we expect to have an even broader suite of products to offer our customers.
 
Grow Sales From Our Newer Licenses. During the past year, we have introduced additional licenses to existing products to support new functionalities, such as new threat models to detect suspicious mailbox, Exchange and Exchange Online behaviors. We released GDPR Patterns, part of the Data Classification Engine family, to help enterprises identify data that falls under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and expand our offerings that help enterprises meet compliance and regulation requirements. We released the Automation Engine to allow customers to automatically repair and maintain file systems so that organizations are less vulnerable to attacks and security breaches, more compliant and consistently meeting a least privilege model. We have enhanced our products to provide even more value to our customers, including additional data store support, enhanced threat detection and security monitoring and new threat models to protect against security breaches, malware, ransomware and insider threats. We believe these new additions to our product offering can be a meaningful contributor to our growth.
 
Expand Our Sales Force. Continuing to expand our salesforce will be essential to achieving our customer base expansion goals. The salesforce and our approach to introducing products to the market has been key to our successful growth in the past and will be central to our growth plan in the future. While our products serve customers of all sizes, in all industries and all geographies, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 1,000 users or more who can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value. The ability of our sales teams to support our channel partners to efficiently identify leads, generate evaluations and convert them to satisfied customers will continue to impact our ability to grow. We intend to expand our sales capacity by adding headcount throughout our sales and marketing department.
Establish Our Data Security Platform as the Industry Standard. We have worked with several of the leading providers of network attached storage, or NAS, hybrid cloud storage, including EMC, IBM, NetApp, HP, Hitachi and Nasuni in order to expand our market reach and deliver enhanced functionality to our customers. We have worked with these vendors to assure compatibility with their product lines. Through the use of application programming interfaces, or APIs, and other integration work, our solutions also integrate with many providers of solutions in the ecosystem. We will continue to pursue such collaborations wherever they advance the strategic goals of the company, thereby expanding our reach and establishing our product user interface as the de facto industry standard when it comes to enterprise data.
Continue International Expansion. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our platform in international markets to comply with regulations such as GDPR. Revenues from EMEA accounted for approximately a third of our revenues in 2017. Europe represented the substantial majority of revenues outside the United States. Although we have experienced inconsistent quarterly growth rates over the last few years in our European market, we believe that international expansion will be a key component of our growth strategy, and we will continue to market our products and services overseas.

Our Products 
 
We have six product families, most of which utilize our core Metadata Framework technology to deliver features and functionality that allow enterprises to fully understand, secure and benefit from the value of their data. This architecture easily extends through modular functionalities giving our clients the flexibility to select the features they require for their business needs and the flexibility to expand their usage simply by adding a license.

• | DatAdvantage. DatAdvantage, our flagship product, launched in 2006, builds on our Metadata Framework and captures, aggregates, normalizes and analyzes every data access event for every user on Windows and UNIX/Linux servers, storage devices, email systems and Intranet servers, without requiring native operating system auditing functionalities or impacting performance or storage on file systems. Through an intuitive graphical interface, DatAdvantage presents insights from massive volumes of data using normal computing infrastructure. It is also our presentation layer for IT departments, which provides an interactive map of relevant user, group, and data objects, usage and content, facilitating analysis from multiple vectors. IT departments can pinpoint areas of interest starting with any metadata object, simulate changes measuring potential impact against historical access patterns, and easily execute changes on all data stores through a unified interface. DatAdvantage identifies where users have unneeded access based on user behavior.

· | The Automation Engine, a module introduced in 2017, helps customers accelerate the enforcement of least privilege by limiting broad access without all the manual legwork. It automatically repairs and maintains file systems, helping reduce customers’ risk profiles and decreasing their overhead and resources required to get to a least privilege model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DatAlert, a module introduced in 2013, profiles users and their behaviors with respect to systems and data, detects and alerts on meaningful deviations to established baselines, and provides a web-based dashboard and investigative interface. DatAlert allows detection of suspicious activity and prevent data breaches and cyberattacks, perform security forensics, visualize risk and prioritize investigation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Varonis Edge, a module announced in 2017 and introduced in early 2018, analyzes perimeter devices like DNS, VPN and Web Proxy to detect attacks like malware, APT intrusion and exfiltration and enables enterprises to correlate events and alerts at the perimeter with alerts and events concerning data to better spot attacks at the point of entry and egress.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DataPrivilege. DataPrivilege, launched in 2006 and designed for use by business unit personnel, provides a self-service web portal that allows users to request access to data necessary for their business functions, and owners to grant access without IT intervention. DataPrivilege also enables IT and business users to make access decisions based on queries, user requests and metadata analytics information, rather than static IT policies. DataPrivilege provides a presentation layer for business users to review accessibility and usage of their data assets, and grant and revoke access.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Classification Engine (formerly IDU Classification Framework). As the volume of an enterprise’s information grows, enterprises struggle to find and tag different types of sensitive data, such as intellectual property, regulated content, including Personally Identifiable Information, and medical records. Furthermore, content by itself does not provide adequate context to determine ownership, relevance, or protection requirements. Our Data Classification Engine, introduced in 2009 as the IDU Classification Framework, identifies and tags data based on criteria set in multiple metadata dimensions and provides business and IT personnel with actionable intelligence about this data, including a prioritized list of folders and files containing the most sensitive data and with the most inadequate permissions. For the identified folders and files, it also identifies who has access to that data, who is using it, who owns it, and recommendations for how to restrict access without disrupting workflow. Our Data Classification Engine provides visibility into the content of data across file systems and Intranets sites and combining it with other metadata, including usage and accessibility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | GDPR Patterns, introduced in 2017, uses the Data Classification Engine as a foundation to identify and classify regulated data in the European Union (“EU”) that falls under the GDPR, with over 250 unique patterns that cover all 28 EU countries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Transport Engine. We introduced our Data Transport Engine software in 2012 to provide an execution engine that unifies the manipulation of data and metadata, translating business decisions and instructions into technical commands such as data migration or archiving. Data Transport Engine allows both IT and business personnel to standardize and streamline activities for data management and retention, from day-to-day maintenance to complex data store and domain migrations and archiving. Our Data Transport Engine ensures that data migrations automatically synchronize source and destination data with incremental copying even if the source data is still in use, translates access permissions across data stores and domains and provides reporting capabilities for data migration status. Moreover, it also provides IT personnel the flexibility to schedule recurring migrations to automatically find and move certain types of data such as sensitive or stale data and to perform active migrations, dispositions and archiving safely and efficiently.

• | DatAnswers. As employees continue to generate and store data in numerous enterprise data stores, relevant files they and their coworkers and predecessors create become harder to find. Unlike the internet, where powerful search engines make relevant web information easy to find despite rapid growth, enterprise file systems are frequently not searchable by employees or IT. Though enterprise search technologies exist, many enterprises do not own or use them to index data, for several reasons, including performance (the index must be up to date to be useful, requiring continual scanning for new and changed content), security (sensitive files that are not adequately restricted become far easier for the wrong people to find), relevance (when many files contain the term or terms a searcher is looking for they are not ranked or presented in a way that they are likely to find the right files), and cost (enterprise search technologies require significant, ongoing investments in hardware and software). DatAnswers was introduced in 2014 to provide secure, relevant and timely search functionality for enterprise data. Capitalizing on the Metadata Framework infrastructure and its analysis of data access events, file system and directory services metadata, DatAnswers indexes files as they are created and changed without requiring continual scanning, filters out results users should not see based on the patented recommendations engine in DatAdvantage and classification results found by the Data Classification Engine, and ranks results using analysis of data usage. DatAnswers is used primarily for end user search and ediscovery projects.

• | DatAnywhere. We introduced DatAnywhere in 2012 in response to the need by enterprises for a secure and easy-to-use alternative to consumer cloud-based file sharing solutions. DatAnywhere provides our customers’ employees a modern collaboration, hybrid-cloud experience using their existing storage infrastructure. As of February 1, 2018, in order to focus our resources on our data security portfolio, we are no longer selling DatAnywhere to new customers although we will continue to provide maintenance and support to our existing DatAnywhere customers for the near future.

Our Customers 
 
Our customer base has grown from approximately 550 customers at December 31, 2009 to approximately 6,250 customers in more than 75 countries as of December 31, 2017. Our customers vary greatly in size ranging from small and medium businesses to large multinational enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees and hundreds of terabytes of data. Moreover, we have customers across numerous industries and geographies.
Services 
 
Maintenance and Support 
 
Our customers typically purchase one year of software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our products, with an option to renew. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period and access to our technical support services.
 
We maintain a customer support organization that provides all levels of support to our customers. Our customers that purchase maintenance and support services receive guaranteed response times, direct telephonic support and access to online support portals. Our customer support organization has global capabilities with expertise in both our software and complex IT environments and associated third-party infrastructure.
 
Professional Services 
 
While users can easily download, install and deploy our software on their own, certain enterprises use our professional service team to provide fee-based services, which include training our customers in the use of our products, providing advice on deployment planning, network design, product configuration and implementation, automating and customizing reports and tuning policies and configuration of our products for the particular characteristics of the customer’s environment.
Sales and Marketing 
 
Sales 
 
We sell the vast majority of our products and services to a global network of hundreds of resellers and distributors that we refer to as our channel partners. Our channel partners, in turn, sell the products they purchase from us to customers globally. In addition, we maintain a highly trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners in winning customers through operating demonstrations and risk assessments. Our channel partners identify potential sales targets, maintain relationships with customers and introduce new products to existing customers. Sales to our channel partners are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive channel partner agreement, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies. These agreements are generally for a term of one year with a one year renewal term and can be terminated by us or the channel partner for any reason upon 30 days’ notice. A termination of the agreement has no effect on orders already placed. Payment to us from the channel partner is typically due within 30 – 90 calendar days of the date we issue an invoice for such sales.

Marketing 
 
Our marketing strategy focuses on building our brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption and demand, communicating advantages and business benefits and generating leads for our channel partners and sales force. We market our software as a Data Security Platform, a solution for securing and managing file systems and enterprise data and transforming that data into actionable intelligence. We execute our marketing strategy by leveraging a combination of internal marketing professionals, external marketing partners and a network of regional and global channel partners. Our internal marketing organization is responsible for branding, content generation and product marketing and works with our business operations team to support channel marketing and sales support programs. We provide one on one and community education and awareness and promote the expanded use of our software. We host in-person Varonis Connect! events annually across sales regions, as well as free, online monthly or bi-weekly technical webinars in multiple regions. We focus our efforts on events, campaigns, tools and activities that can be leveraged by our channel partners worldwide to extend our marketing reach, such as sales tools, information regarding product awards and technical certifications, training, regional seminars and conferences, webinars and various other demand-generation activities. Our marketing efforts also include public relations in multiple regions, analyst relations, customer marketing, extensive content development available through our web site and content syndication, and our active blog, “The Inside Out Security Blog.”
Seasonality
 
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Seasonality and Quarterly Trends.”
 
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving and enhancing our existing products and services, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. Use of our products has expanded from governance into new areas such as data security, accessibility and retention, and we anticipate that customers and innovation will drive functionality into additional areas. We regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones. We conduct substantially all of our research and development activities in Israel, and we believe this provides us with access to world class engineering talent.
 
Our research and development expense was $47.4 million, $36.7 million and $31.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology and the related intellectual property. The nature and extent of legal protection of our intellectual property rights depends on, among other things, its type and the jurisdiction in which it arises. As of January 31, 2018, we had 52 issued patents and 33 pending patent applications in the United States. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2038. We also had 18 patents issued and 67 applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 10 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications, all of which are counterparts of our U.S. patent applications. Certain of our patents are owned by our Israeli subsidiary. The claims for which we have sought patent protection relate primarily to inventions we have developed for incorporation into our products. We also license software from third parties for use in developing our products and for integration into our products, including open source software.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our trade secrets or other confidential information. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, vendors and customers and generally limit internal and external access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information and proprietary technology through certain procedural safeguards. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or technology. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.

Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of relevant patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third-parties have asserted and may assert their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or customers. Successful claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or could require us to pay substantial damages (including, for example, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents and increased statutory damages if we are found to have willfully infringed copyrights), royalties or other fees. Such claims also could require us to cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others, or to expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop non-infringing technology. Even if third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable, and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, results of operations or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. In some cases, we indemnify our channel partners and customers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties.
 
Competition 
 
While there are some companies which offer certain features similar to those embedded in our solutions, as well as others with which we compete in certain use cases, we believe that we do not currently compete with a company that offers the same breadth of functionalities that we offer in a single integrated solution. Nevertheless, we do compete against a select group of software vendors, such as Veritas Technologies LLC and Quest Software, that provide standalone solutions, similar to those found in our comprehensive software suite, in the specific markets in which we operate. We also face direct competition with respect to certain of our products, specifically Data Transport Engine, DatAnswers and DatAdvantage for Directory Services. As we continue to augment our functionality with insider threat detection and user behavior analytics and as we expand our classification capabilities to better serve compliance needs with new regulations, like GDPR, we may face increased perceived and real competition from other security and classification technologies. In the future, as customer requirements evolve and new technologies are introduced, we may experience increased competition if established or emerging companies develop solutions that address the enterprise data market. Furthermore, because we operate in a relatively new and evolving area, we anticipate that competition will increase based on customer demand for these types of products.
 
A number of factors influence our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate, including, without limitation: the continued reliability and effectiveness of our products’ functionalities; the breadth and completeness of our solutions’ features; the scalability of our solutions; and the ease of deployment and use of our products. We believe that we generally compete favorably in each of these categories. We also believe that we distinguish ourselves from others by delivering a single, integrated solution to address our customers’ needs regarding access, governance, collaboration and retention with respect to their enterprise data. There can, however, be no assurance that we will remain unique in this capacity or that we will be able to compete favorably with other providers in the future.
 
If a more established company were to target our market, we may face significant competition. They may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintain renewals and licenses at the same rate. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share.
 
In addition, our current or prospective channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with any future competitors. These relationships may allow future competitors to rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could also limit our ability to generate revenues from existing and new customers. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,251 employees and independent contractors, of which 547 were in the United States, 409 were in Israel and 295 were in other countries. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us.
