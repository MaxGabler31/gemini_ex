Description of Business



Vado Corp., previously known as TradeFan, Inc., (the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation established on February 10, 2017 and has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end. We have not generated material revenue, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. The Company formerly had operations in the embroidery business in the European Union. With the Change of Control described in the following paragraph, the Company terminated its operations in the embroidery business and wrote off its assets. The Company currently has no operations and is seeking new business opportunities in the United States.  On February 10, 2021, the Company entered into a non-binding Term Sheet with another company (the “Target”) which if consummated would have resulted in the shareholders of the Target owning 87% of the common stock of the Company. The Target does business under the name of TradeFan which is why the Company had increased its authorized common stock and changed its name  to “TradeFan, Inc.” on March 15,2021. The Term Sheet also envisioned the Company raising $2 million from the sale of convertible preferred stock. However, in June 2021, the Company decided not to proceed with the transaction. The Company does not envision any alternative financings occurring in the near term. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to locate a suitable acquisition target or that a reverse merger or similar transaction, or a related financing, will occur. On August 23, 2021, the Company changed its name back to Vado Corp.



The Company currently has no operations and is seeking to acquire a new business in the United States, including potentially by means of a reverse merger with an operating entity. We have not generated revenues since we divested our operating subsidiaries and do not expect to do so in the short-term due to the early stage nature of our Company.



The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process, and we have not yet identified a target operating business for acquisition. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the businesses we identify as viable for our objectives, including due to competitive forces in the marketplace beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities for the Company. Moreover, due to changes in the Rules of OTC Markets, which operates the Pink Open Market where our common stock trades, we must complete a merger with or acquisition of an operating company by March 2023 or our common stock will effectively cease trading. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Competition and Market Conditions



We will face substantial competition in our efforts to identify and pursue a business venture. The primary source of competition is expected to be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, including small venture capital firms, blank check companies, and wealthy investors, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In light of our limited financial and human resources, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many of our competitors in our efforts to obtain an operating business or assets necessary to commence our operations in a new field. Additionally, with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, many venture capital firms and similar firms and individuals have been seeking to acquire businesses at discounted rates, and we therefore currently face additional competition and resultant difficulty obtaining a business. We expect these conditions to persist at least until such time as the economy recovers. Further, even if we are successful in obtaining a business or assets for new operations, we expect there to be enhanced barriers to entry in the marketplace in which we decide to operate as a result of reduced demand and/or increased raw material costs caused by the pandemic and other economic forces that are beyond our control.
Regulation

Depending on the direction management decides to take and a business or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may become subject to other laws or regulations that require us to make material expenditures on compliance including the increasing state level regulation of privacy. Any such requirements could require us to divert significant human and capital resources on compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.
