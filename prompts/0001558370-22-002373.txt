ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “Theravance Biopharma” or the “Company”) is a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of respiratory medicines. Our core purpose is to create medicines that make a difference® in people’s lives. 
​
In pursuit of our purpose, we leverage decades of respiratory expertise to discover and develop transformational medicines that make a difference. These efforts have led to the development of the United States (“US”) Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved YUPELRI® (revefenacin) inhalation solution indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). Our respiratory pipeline of internally discovered programs is targeted to address significant patient respiratory needs.
​
We have an economic interest in potential future payments from Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (“GSK”) pursuant to our agreements with Innoviva, Inc. (“Innoviva”) relating to certain programs, including TRELEGY.
​
2021 Significant Developments
​
Financing
We successfully closed an offering of 7,705,000 ordinary shares at a price to the public of $15.00 per share in June 2021 raising $115.6 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The net proceeds from the offering are intended to support the development of our clinical product candidates and for general working capital purposes.
​
Clinical Results from Late-Stage Studies of Izencitinib and Ampreloxetine 
In August 2021, we reported that results from our Phase 2b dose-finding induction study of izencitinib, our oral gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor for inflammatory intestinal diseases, previously partnered with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), did not meet its primary endpoint of change in the total Mayo score or the key secondary endpoint of clinical remission at week 8, relative to placebo.
​
In addition, in September 2021, we reported that results from our four-week Phase 3 study (SEQUOIA) of ampreloxetine, our norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, did not meet its primary endpoint for assessing safety and efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”).
​
Strategic Actions to Focus on Respiratory Diseases
Given the above clinical results, in September 2021, our board of directors approved a plan to focus our resources on our most promising respiratory programs and reduce the size of the Company in order to maximize shareholder value. At completion, the corporate restructuring (the “Restructuring”) will result in us reducing headcount by approximately 75%, an estimated 270 positions, through a reduction in our workforce. Approximately 75% of the total reduction in workforce occurred at the end November 2021, and the remainder will be completed at the end of February 2022. 
​
As a result of the Restructuring, we expect to realize estimated operating expense savings (excluding share-based compensation and any one-time restructuring, severance, and termination costs) of approximately $170.0 million. We estimate that we will incur total Restructuring and related expenses of approximately $32.0 million comprised of $17.0 million in cash expenses associated with employee termination benefits and related costs and $15.0 million in non-cash expenses relating to the acceleration of equity-awards for employees affected by the Restructuring. In 2021, we recognized $20.1 million of the Restructuring expenses comprised of $11.5 million in cash-related expenses and $8.6 million in non-cash expenses. 
​

We expect to recognize the majority of the remaining Restructuring and related expenses of approximately $12.0 million, comprised of $5.0 million in cash-related expenses and $7.0 million in non-cash expenses, in the first quarter of 2022 and the balance by the third quarter of 2022. The remaining Restructuring expense estimates are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual final amounts may differ. We may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the Restructuring. 
​
The go-forward organization leverages our expertise in developing and commercializing respiratory therapeutics. We intend to significantly narrow our R&D focus on our core respiratory assets, including a clinical study with Viatris Inc. (“Viatris”) intended to provide data to support a possible label update for YUPELRI, which we believe would capture more of YUPELRI’s addressable market and further strengthen its competitive advantage, and investment in our inhaled Janus kinase inhibitor portfolio, with focus on our most advanced clinical candidate, nezulcitinib, initially targeting acute lung injury. We will also continue to explore strategic partnerships for both core and non-core assets to unlock value. All of these actions drive towards our goal to maximize shareholder value.
​
After implementing these strategic actions, we plan to become sustainably cash flow positive beginning in the second half of 2022, and we will work to optimize our capital structure in order to maximize total shareholder returns. 
​
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments, companies, and individuals around the world in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus (including new variants of COVID-19) continue to present a substantial public health and economic challenge and are affecting our employees, patients, communities, clinical trial sites, suppliers, business partners and business operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including revenue, expenses, clinical trials and research and development costs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and may be impacted by the emergence of new information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing spread of the disease across the US and the globe, and the actions taken to contain or treat the disease, including vaccine availability, distribution, acceptance and effectiveness.
​
As part of our response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to continue to implement measures as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clinical trial sites and participants, the patients we serve, and other stakeholders in light of COVID-19.

Respiratory Program Highlights 
YUPELRI (revefenacin) Inhalation Solution
​
YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution is a once-daily, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD in the US. LAMAs are recognized by international COPD treatment guidelines as a cornerstone of maintenance therapy for COPD, regardless of severity of disease. Our market research indicates there is an enduring population of COPD patients in the US that either need or prefer nebulized delivery for maintenance therapy. The stability of revefenacin in both metered dose inhaler and dry powder inhaler (“MDI/DPI”) formulations suggests that revefenacin could also serve as a foundation for novel handheld combination products. 
​
In November 2018, YUPELRI was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. Following shipments into commercial channel in late 2018, we and our collaboration partner, Viatris, formally launched our sales and marketing efforts in early 2019. In 2020 and through 2021, YUPELRI’s growth trajectory was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in late 2021, we began to observe a return to growth in YUPELRI sales. We continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on demand for YUPELRI, including the duration and degree to which we may see the rate of starting new patients on YUPELRI and customer orders return to pre-pandemic levels. Although we believe there are signals of easing pandemic restrictions, at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate disruptive impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on YUPELRI, but it is possible the pandemic may continue to put downward pressure on our sales. As a result, the observed sales volatility may continue into 2022.
​
We and Viatris continue to supply YUPELRI to our patients and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply. In addition, we are tracking several key performance metrics to gauge success in building market acceptance, including formulary success and market access. 
​
In August 2021, we announced that in collaboration with our partner Viatris, we are initiating a Phase 4 study comparing improvements in lung function in adults with severe to very severe COPD and suboptimal inspiratory flow rate following once-daily treatment with either YUPELRI delivered via standard jet nebulizer or tiotropium delivered via a dry powder inhaler (Spiriva® HandiHaler®). This study is aimed at helping to better inform decisions when physicians are designing a personalized COPD treatment plan with patients and is intended to support a possible label update for YUPELRI, which would capture more of YUPELRI’s addressable market and further strengthen its competitive advantage. In January 2022, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 4 study.
​
Viatris Collaboration
​
In January 2015, we and Viatris established a strategic collaboration for the development and commercialization of revefenacin. Partnering with a leader in nebulized respiratory therapies enables us to expand the breadth of our revefenacin development program and extend our commercial reach beyond the acute care setting. Viatris funded the Phase 3 development program of YUPELRI, enabling us to advance other high value pipeline assets

alongside YUPELRI.
​
Under the terms of the Viatris Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Viatris Agreement”), Viatris and Theravance Biopharma co-develop revefenacin for COPD and other respiratory diseases. We led the US Phase 3 development program for YUPELRI in COPD, and Viatris was responsible for reimbursement of our costs related to the registrational program up until the approval of the first new drug application (“NDA”), after which costs are shared. With YUPELRI approved in the US, Viatris is leading commercialization, and we co-promote the product in the US under a profit and loss sharing arrangement (65% to Viatris; 35% to Theravance Biopharma). Outside the US, Viatris is responsible for development and commercialization and will pay us a tiered royalty on net sales at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. 
​
In June 2019, we announced the expansion of the Viatris Agreement to grant Viatris exclusive development and commercialization rights to nebulized revefenacin in China and adjacent territories, which include Hong Kong SAR, the Macau SAR, and Taiwan. In exchange, we received an upfront payment of $18.5 million (before a required tax withholding) and will be eligible to receive additional potential development and sales milestones totaling $54.0 million and low double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of nebulized revefenacin, if approved. In March 2020, we earned a $1.5 million development milestone for the acceptance of a clinical trial application associated with the use of revefenacin monotherapy in China and adjacent territories. Viatris is responsible for all aspects of development and commercialization in the partnered regions, including pre- and post-launch activities and product registration and all associated costs. We retain worldwide rights to revefenacin delivered through other dosage forms, such as a MDI/DPI.
​
Under the Viatris Agreement, as of December 31, 2021, we are eligible to receive from Viatris potential global development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $257.5 million in the aggregate with $205.0 million associated with YUPELRI monotherapy and $52.5 million associated with future potential combination products. Of the $205.0 million associated with monotherapy, $187.5 million relates to sales milestones based on achieving certain levels of net sales and $17.5 million relates to global development and regulatory actions. The $52.5 million associated with future potential combination products relates solely to global development and regulatory actions. 
​
Lung-selective, Nebulized Pan-Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor (Nezulcitinib)
​
Nezulcitinib (formerly known as TD-0903) is a lung-selective, nebulized JAK inhibitor, in clinical development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury (“ALI”) caused by COVID-19. We discovered nezulcitinib, and it has been shown in experimental murine models to have potent, broad inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in the airways following challenges with multiple cytokines. Preclinical studies suggest that nezulcitinib has a high lung to plasma ratio and rapid metabolic clearance resulting in low systemic exposure, compatible with its lung selectivity. Nezulcitinib is administered via nebulized inhalation solution, which further enhances its lung selectivity. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies indicate that nezulcitinib has an extended duration of action that should enable once daily dosing in humans. 
​
We believe nezulcitinib has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”). The first healthy volunteer was dosed in a Phase 1 study of nezulcitinib in April 2020, and in June 2020, we completed Phase 1 and entered a two-part Phase 2 study. Phase 2 was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nezulcitinib in subjects with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 hospitalized for symptomatic respiratory insufficiency. This study also evaluated the PK of nezulcitinib in these subjects. To expedite enrollment, we opened additional sites in other regions including Europe, the US, and South America. 
​
We completed Phase 2, Part 1, a small sub-study of 25 patients intended to assess safety, PK and exploratory clinical measures of three doses of nezulcitinib versus placebo. Data showed that inhaled administration of nebulized nezulcitinib, once daily over seven days, was generally well-tolerated and showed a numerical trend towards improved clinical status, reduced hospital stay and resulted in fewer deaths compared to placebo during a 28-day observation period. Nezulcitinib also demonstrated evidence of improvements in several relevant inflammatory biomarkers and low systemic exposure at all doses. This demonstrates the lung-selective design features of the molecule.
​

The Phase 2 Dose Finding study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluating efficacy and safety of one dose (3 mg) of nezulcitinib (selected based on the data from Part 1) as compared with placebo in 200 patients. In June 2021, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2 study of 3 mg once-daily nezulcitinib compared to placebo, each in combination with standard of care, which generally included steroids. The study did not meet the primary endpoint of number of Respiratory Failure-Free Days from randomization through Day 28 in the intent-to-treat population. The study also did not meet secondary endpoints, with no difference shown in change from baseline at Day 7 in SaO2/FiO2 ratio, proportion of patients in each category of the eight-point Clinical Status scale, or proportion of patients alive and respiratory failure-free at Day 28. However, nezulcitinib demonstrated a favorable trend in improvement when compared to placebo for 28-day all-cause mortality. In addition, in a post-hoc analysis of patients with C-reactive protein (“CRP”) <150 mg/L, there was an improvement in those treated with nezulcitinib when compared to placebo in 28-day all-cause mortality and in time to recovery while there was no difference in these outcomes in patients with CRP >150 mg/L. Nezulcitinib was generally well-tolerated, and we intend to further investigate its therapeutic potential as part of our newly focused respiratory portfolio.
​
Lung-selective Pan-JAK Inhibitor Program 
​
TD-8236, an inhaled lung-selective pan-JAK inhibitor, demonstrated a high affinity for each of the JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While orally-administered JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of a range of inflammatory diseases, no inhaled JAK inhibitor is approved for the treatment of airway disease, including asthma. The pan-JAK activity of TD-8236 suggests that it may impact a broad range of cytokines that have been associated both T2-high and T2-low asthma. Many moderate to severe asthma patients comprising both T2 phenotypes remain symptomatic despite being compliant on high doses of inhaled steroids. Importantly, TD-8236 was designed to distribute and exert its anti-inflammatory effect within the lungs following dry powder inhalation, with the potential to treat inflammation within that organ while minimizing systemic exposure. In preclinical assessments, TD-8236 has shown to potently inhibit targeted mediators of T2-high and T2-low asthma in human cells.
​
In September 2019, we announced positive results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of TD-8236, an investigational, inhaled lung-selective pan-JAK inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for each of the JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. The Part C extension portion of the Phase 1 trial, assessing additional biomarkers in patients with moderate to severe asthma, demonstrated that biomarkers of JAK target engagement (including exhaled nitric oxide and pSTAT1 and pSTAT6 in cellular fractions of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were reduced after 7 days of once-daily dosing at a dose level of 1500 µg. In December 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 allergen challenge study of TD-8236 in mild allergic asthma patients, and we reported results of the Phase 1C study in the third quarter of 2020. TD-8236 is the first JAK inhibitor to be studied in a Phase 2a Lung Allergen Challenge (“LAC”) study, but inconsistent with our expectations, it had no impact on decrease in lung function (FEV1) following allergen inhalation after 14 days of once-daily dosing at dose levels of 150 µg and 1500 µg compared to placebo and did not meet the primary study objective. The collective data set (preclinical, Phase 1, Phase 2a) demonstrates TD-8236 engages the JAK mechanism at a dose of 1500 µg as evidenced by the reduction in FeNO and reductions in pSTAT, but does not protect against the lung function decline seen after allergen inhalation. 
​
After completing additional analysis on TD-8236 gene signature and biomarker data from the Phase 1C study, we found that the data are consistent with target engagement in the lung. However, based on our current understanding of TD-8236, we have decided to pause the clinical program for this compound in its current form and apply our learnings to refining and expanding molecules in our portfolio of inhaled JAK inhibitors. We expect to proceed into the clinic with the next generation compound after securing a strategic partnership. 
​
The robust body of scientific evidence from TD-8236 and nezulcitinib programs provide confidence for us to continue the lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor program for asthma. The full data set for TD-8236 will be presented at future scientific meetings.

Non-Core Asset Highlights 
​
The key operational activities for all izencitinib and ampreloxetine studies will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022.
​
Ampreloxetine (TD-9855)
​
Ampreloxetine is an investigational, once-daily norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”) that we were developing for the treatment of patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”). nOH is caused by primary autonomic failure conditions, including multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and pure autonomic failure. The compound has high affinity for binding to norepinephrine transporters. By blocking the action of these transporters, ampreloxetine causes an increase in extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine. Ampreloxetine is wholly owned by Theravance Biopharma.
​
Based on positive top-line four-week results from a small exploratory Phase 2 study in nOH and discussions with the FDA, we advanced ampreloxetine into a Phase 3 program. We announced the initiation of patient dosing in study in early 2019. The Phase 3 program consists of two pivotal studies and one non-pivotal study. The first pivotal study (SEQUOIA), a four-week, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ampreloxetine in patients with symptomatic nOH. The second pivotal study (REDWOOD), a four-month open label study followed by a six-week randomized withdrawal phase was designed to evaluate the durability of patient response of ampreloxetine. The third, non-pivotal study (OAK), was designed to allow patients who completed REDWOOD to have continued access to ampreloxetine for up to three and half years.
​
In September 2021, we reported that the four-week SEQUOIA Phase 3 clinical study did not meet its primary endpoint. Most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Serious adverse events occurred in two patients on placebo and four on ampreloxetine and none were considered related to the study drug. No deaths were reported, and there was no signal for supine hypertension. Study activities for the ampreloxetine Phase 3 program will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022. 
​
Gut-selective Pan-JAK Inhibitor Program (Izencitinib) 
​
JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, myelofibrosis, atopic dermatitis, and ulcerative colitis and have demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with Crohn’s disease. However, these products are known to have side effects based on their systemic exposure. With izencitinib, our goal was to develop an orally administered, gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor specifically designed to distribute adequately and predominantly to the tissues of the intestinal tract, treating inflammation in those tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. 
​
Based on positive results from a Phase 1b exploratory study in ulcerative colitis and following dialogues with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) regarding study design, we advanced izencitinib into two clinical studies in inflammatory intestinal diseases. The Phase 2 (DIONE) study was a twelve-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patients with Crohn’s disease, which began dosing patients in late 2018. The Phase 2b/3 (RHEA) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eight weeks induction and 44 weeks maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis, which began dosing patients in early 2019. 
​
In August 2021, we reported that the Phase 2b/3 (RHEA) study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in the total Mayo score or the key secondary endpoint of clinical remission at week 8, relative to placebo. There was a small dose-dependent increase in clinical response measured by the adapted Mayo score, which was driven by a reduction in rectal bleeding. 
​
At all doses, izencitinib was well-tolerated when administered orally once daily for 8 weeks; adverse event rates were similar among patients receiving izencitinib and placebo. There were no instances of perforation, opportunistic 

10



infection, major cardiovascular or thromboembolic event, complicated zoster, or non-melanoma skin cancer in patients receiving izencitinib. There were no notable changes in lab values including creatine phosphokinase and lipids in
patients receiving izencitinib relative to placebo. Plasma exposure of izencitinib was low, consistent with expectations for a gut-selective medicine. We plan to present the study results at a future scientific forum. The Phase 2 study in Crohn’s disease with izencitinib has completed enrollment with top-line results expected in the first quarter of 2022. 
​
Irreversible JAK3 Inhibitor (TD-5202)
​
TD-5202 is an investigational, orally administered, gut-selective, irreversible JAK3 inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for the JAK3 enzyme. Through the selective inhibition of JAK3, TD-5202 interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of select pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 which play a central role in the pathogenesis of T-cell mediated disease, including inflammatory intestinal disease, such as celiac disease. Importantly, TD-5202 is specifically designed to act locally within the intestinal wall thereby limiting systemic exposure. 
​
In September 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD-5202 in healthy participants, plus assess plasma pharmacokinetics of TD-5202 to confirm circulating levels are low, consistent with a gut-selective approach. In February 2020, we announced that data from the Phase 1 study indicated that TD-5202 was generally well tolerated as a single oral dose up to 2000 milligrams and as a twice-daily oral dose up 2000 milligrams total per day given for ten consecutive days in healthy participants. 
​
Janssen Biotech Collaboration
​
In February 2018, we announced a global co-development and commercialization agreement with Janssen for izencitinib and related back-up compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $100.0 million and was eligible to receive up to an additional $900.0 million in potential payments, inclusive of a potential $200.0 million opt-in payment following completion of the Phase 2 Crohn’s disease study and the Phase 2b induction portion of the ulcerative colitis study. Following the unfavorable Phase 2b ulcerative colitis study results announced in August 2021, in December 2021, we received notice from Janssen terminating the agreement, effective January 16, 2022. 
​
Inhaled ALK5i
​
Our ALK5 inhibitor is a potential first-in-class, inhaled anti-fibrotic agent for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”), a fatal chronic lung disease with limited treatment options. Despite treatment with the current standard of care, IPF patients continue to experience disease progression and exacerbation, and therefore IPF treatment represents a significant unmet medical need. The compound targets the TGFβ pathway, a core signaling pathway that drives fibrosis. By being inhaled, the ALK5i efficiently inhibits TGFβ signaling locally in the lung which is expected to maximize its therapeutic effect.
​
Economic Interest in GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs
We hold an 85% economic interest in any future payments that may be made by GSK to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC (“TRC”) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters) relating to the GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs, which Innoviva partnered with GSK and assigned to TRC in connection with Innoviva’s separation of its biopharmaceutical operations into its then wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma in June 2014. The GSK-Partnered Respiratory Programs consist primarily of the TRELEGY program, which is described in more detail below. We are entitled to this economic interest through our equity ownership in TRC. Our economic interest does not include any payments associated with RELVAR ELLIPTA/BREO ELLIPTA, ANORO ELLIPTA or vilanterol monotherapy. 
 ​
The following information regarding the TRELEGY program is based solely upon publicly available information and may not reflect the most recent developments under the programs.

TRELEGY (the combination of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol)
TRELEGY provides the activity of an inhaled corticosteroid (FF) plus two bronchodilators (UMEC, a LAMA, and VI, a long-acting beta2 agonist, or LABA) in a single delivery device administered once-daily. TRELEGY is approved for use in the US, European Union (“EU”), and other countries for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. We hold an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters) through our interest in TRC. Those royalties are upward-tiering from 6.5% to 10%, resulting in cash flows to us of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of TRELEGY (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). Theravance Biopharma is not responsible for any of GSK’s costs related to the development or commercialization of TRELEGY.
​
Additionally, the FDA approved an sNDA for the use of TRELEGY to treat asthma in adults in September 2020 making TRELEGY the first once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the treatment of both asthma and COPD in the US. GSK has obtained approval for the asthma indication in ten additional markets. TRELEGY is currently expected to generate global peak sales of $3.6 billion annually according to consensus estimates. Over the past three years, TRELEGY has shown impressive growth, with global net sales increasing from $663 million in 2019 to $1.1 billion in 2020 and to $1.7 billion in 2021.
​
Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC
Prior to the June 2014 spin-off from Innoviva, our former parent company, Innoviva assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC (“TRC”), a Delaware limited liability company formed by Innoviva, its strategic alliance agreement with GSK and all of its rights and obligations under its collaboration agreement with GSK, other than with respect to RELVAR ELLIPTA/BREO ELLIPTA, ANORO ELLIPTA and vilanterol monotherapy. 
​
Our equity interest in TRC is the mechanism by which we are entitled to the 85% economic interest in any future payments made by GSK under the strategic alliance agreement and under the portion of the collaboration agreement assigned to TRC by Innoviva (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). TRELEGY is currently the only commercial product arising out of the GSK agreements assigned by Innoviva to TRC. Royalty payments from GSK to TRC arising from the net sales of Trelegy are presented in our consolidated statements of operations within “Income from investment in TRC, LLC” and is classified as non-operating income. In June 2020, we also recorded $8.5 million within “Income from investment in TRC, LLC” representing our share of a $10.0 million fee that GSK agreed to pay TRC upon termination of the inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist  (“MABA”) program. Seventy-five percent of the “Income from investment in TRC, LLC,” as evidenced by the Issuer II Class C Units (defined below), is available only for payment of the $400.0 million original aggregate amount of 9.5% fixed rate non-recourse term notes due 2035 (the “Non-Recourse 2035 Notes”) and is not available to pay our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors.

Our special purpose subsidiary Triple Royalty Sub II LLC (the “Issuer II”) issued the Non-Recourse 2035 Notes in February 2020, the proceeds of which were used in part to repay the outstanding balance of our 9.0% non-recourse notes, due on or before 2033 (the “Non-Recourse 2033 Notes”) that were issued in November 2018. The Non-Recourse 2035 Notes are secured by all of the Issuer II’s rights, title and interest as a holder of certain membership interests (the “Issuer II Class C Units”) in TRC. The Issuer II Class C Units entitle the Issuer II to receive 63.75% of the economic interest that TRC receives in any future payments made by GSK under the agreements described above, or 75% of the income from our 85% ownership interest in TRC. 
​
We initiated an arbitration proceeding in October 2020 against Innoviva and TRC, challenging the authority of Innoviva and TRC to pursue a business plan to use TRELEGY royalties to invest in certain privately-held companies, rather than distribute such funds that would otherwise be available for distribution to us under the terms of the TRC LLC Agreement to us in a manner that we believe is consistent with the TRC LLC Agreement and our 85% economic interest in TRC.  
​

12



On March 30, 2021, the arbitrator ruled that, we had not shown that at their then current levels of investment, Innoviva and TRC had not breached the TRC LLC Agreement as of the date of the arbitration. The arbitrator further ruled that Innoviva and TRC had not breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; or their fiduciary duties. The arbitrator also ruled that (i) Innoviva was entitled to indemnification from TRC for all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in the arbitration and (ii) we were entitled to indemnification from TRC for legal fees and costs incurred in defending an action Innoviva brought against us in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The arbitrator noted in the ruling that although we failed to show that Innoviva’s investment activities, at the then current levels of investment, have or will have a material and adverse effect on our economic interest in TRC, this does not mean that any future investments or actions will not require our consent. The arbitrator noted in the ruling that we may, in the future, have a consent right over the decision to continue this investment strategy or whether to make a particular investment if, for example, Innoviva develops a track record of poor investments, over allocates royalties to these investment activities, or fails to distribute sufficient investment returns, and such facts cause the strategy or investment to have a material adverse effect on our economic interest in TRC. 
​
Pursuant to the terms of the TRC LLC Agreement, Innoviva is required to deliver to us a draft quarterly financial plan 30 days prior to the end of each fiscal quarter covering the next fiscal quarter. While the TRC LLC Agreement provides that Innoviva must consider in good faith any comments the Company provides, an applicable financial plan becomes effective 30 days after the draft plan is provided to the Company. We have objected to the proposed investments in private companies presented in draft TRC quarterly financial plans to date. If TRC identifies and consummates investments and incurs associated fees identified in a TRC quarterly plan, even over the Company’s objections, distributions by TRC to its members in subsequent quarters will be reduced.
​
Our objections with regard to a draft TRC quarterly plan or other actions by TRC could result in additional legal proceedings between us, TRC and Innoviva, as was the case when we initiated arbitration proceedings against Innoviva and TRC in May 2019 and again in October 2020. Any such legal proceedings could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur significant costs, regardless of the outcome, which we cannot predict. If such proceedings were pursued, there can be no assurance that they would result in us receiving additional distributions from TRC. An adverse result could materially and adversely affect the funds that our affiliates would otherwise expect to receive from TRC in the future. See “Risk Factors—We do not control the commercialization of TRELEGY and we do not control TRC; accordingly the amount of royalties we receive will depend on, among other factors, GSK’s ability to further commercialize TRELEGY and TRC’s decisions concerning use of cash in accordance with the TRC LLC Agreement” for additional information.

Other Economic Interests
Selective 5-HT4 Agonist (TD-8954)
​
TD-8954 is a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist being developed for potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders.
​
Takeda Collaborative Arrangement
​
In June 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Takeda Agreement”) with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Millennium”), in order to establish a collaboration for the development and commercialization of TD-8954 (TAK-954). Millennium is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”). TD-8954 is currently in a Phase 2 study as a potential treatment for post-operative gastrointestinal dysfunction. Under the terms of the Takeda Agreement, Takeda is responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of TD-8954. We received an upfront cash payment of $15.0 million and will be eligible to receive success-based development, regulatory and sales milestone payments from Takeda. We will also be eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales by Takeda at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens.
​
Skin-selective Pan-JAK inhibitor Program 
​
In December 2019, we entered into a global license agreement with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) for our preclinical skin-selective, locally-acting pan-JAK inhibitor program (the “Pfizer Agreement”). The compounds in this program are 

13



designed to target validated pro-inflammatory pathways and are specifically designed to possess skin-selective activity with minimal systemic exposure.
​
Under the Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain compounds for all uses other than gastrointestinal, ophthalmic and respiratory applications. We received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $240.0 million in development and sales milestone payments from Pfizer. In addition, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales of any potential products under the license at percentage royalty rates ranging from middle single-digits to low double-digits.
​
Research Projects
Our research projects leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines to address the needs of patients suffering from respiratory illness. As a result of our strategic restructuring announced in September 2021, we intend to streamline and narrow our R&D focus on our highest value core respiratory opportunities. This would include the peak inspiratory flow rate (“PIFR”) clinical study, in partnership with Viatris, to support the label update of YUPELRI and continued investment in our investigational inhaled Janus kinase inhibitor portfolio, with focus on the most advanced clinical candidate, nezulcitinib, initially targeting acute lung injury. 
​
Our Strategy
Our core purpose is to create medicines that help improve the lives of patients suffering from respiratory illness. We strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization. Our principle strategic objective is to leverage decades of respiratory expertise to discover and develop respiratory medicines that make a difference in people’s lives.
​
We follow these core guiding principles in our mission to drive value creation:
​

• | Focus on insight and innovation;
--+---------------------------------


• | Outsource non-core activities;
--+-------------------------------


• | Create and foster an integrated environment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Aggressively manage uncertainty.
--+---------------------------------

We manage our pipeline with the goal of optimizing program value and allocation of resources. We employ multiple strategies for commercialization of our products. Our approach may involve retaining product rights and marketing a product independently in the US or we may partner a product to extend our commercial reach, to expand our geographic reach, and/or to manage the financial risk associated with the program. Alternatively, we may monetize or divest an asset that we designate as outside our core business, where we believe the program is optimized by leveraging partner capabilities and removing or limiting our research and development costs.
​
Manufacturing
We rely primarily on a network of third-party manufacturers, including contract manufacturing organizations, to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and drug products required for our clinical trials and drug product. We believe that we and our partners have in-house expertise to manage this network of third-party manufacturers, and we believe that we will be able to continue to negotiate third-party manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and that it will not be necessary for us to rely on internal manufacturing capacity in order to develop or, potentially, commercialize our products. However, if we are unable to obtain contract manufacturing or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, or if manufacturing is interrupted at one of our suppliers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, we may not be able to develop our products or commercialize product as planned.
​
Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of API or drug product in a timely manner from current or future sources could disrupt our research and development programs, the conduct of future clinical trials or our commercialization efforts. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “There is a single source of 

14



supply for a number of our product candidates and for YUPELRI, and our business will be harmed if any of these single-source manufacturers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Government Regulation 
The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and our product candidates by us, our collaboration partners and licensees, and those commercializing products in which we have an economic interest, such as GSK, and our ongoing research are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the US and other countries. Before marketing in the US, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Outside the US, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities which are subject to equally rigorous regulatory obligations. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, the commercialization of pharmaceutical products is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.
​
Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the US, we must submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies and the results of preclinical studies. An IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA issues a clinical hold. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following:
​
Phase 1. The product candidate is introduced into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
​
Phase 2. The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
​
Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
​
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, and under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), certain applications for approval must also include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The submission of an NDA generally requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions. FDA’s PDUFA performance goal is to review and act on 90 percent of priority new molecular entity (“NME”) NDA submissions within 6 months of the 60-day filing date, and to review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or issues a complete response letter (“CRL”) listing the application’s deficiencies. The CRL may require additional testing or information, including additional pre-clinical or clinical data, for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If FDA grants approval, an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Post-approval modifications to the drug, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval.
​

15



If an application is approved, drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, and the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or the implementation of other risk management measures, including distribution-related restrictions, if there are new safety information developments, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution.
​
If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the medicine was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the medicine’s labeling. If this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines, carefully monitoring manufacturers’ compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations by conducting regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement actions or seek sanctions, including fines, issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including fines, issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, costly recalls, withdrawal of FDA approval, and criminal prosecution.
​
Additionally, the FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, advertising and promotion to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses - that is, uses not approved by the FDA and not described in the product’s labeling - because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced, scientific communication regarding off-label use. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug. 
​
We, our collaboration partners and licensees are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Outside the US, the ability to market products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries.

United States Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and impacts pricing and reimbursement of YUPELRI and the marketed drugs with respect to which we are entitled to royalty or similar payments, and related commercial operations. Certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, its implementation, efforts to modify, or invalidate, the Healthcare Reform Act or portions thereof, or its implementation, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on the ability of us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
We participated in and had certain price reporting obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate and other programs for VIBATIV ® for which we remain responsible, as described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we failed to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Our ability, and the ability of our collaboration partners, licensees, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties to commercialize our products successfully, and our ability to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the US, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. The reimbursement environment is described in greater detail under the risk factor “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Our interactions and arrangements with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable US federal and state fraud and abuse laws and equivalent third country laws. These laws and the related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “Our relationships with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Data Privacy and Protection 
We are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the US, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”)), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Similar obligations apply outside of the US. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which entered into force on May 25, 2018 amplified existing data protection obligations in the EU. These laws and related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or 

17



adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. Our policy is to seek in the US and selected foreign countries patent protection for novel technologies and compositions of matter that are commercially important to the development of our business. For proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery process that involve proprietary know-how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties.
​
As of December 31, 2021, we owned 285 issued US patents and 1,968 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending US patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are typically directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, crystalline forms, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and/or processes for making our compounds. In particular, our wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma R&D IP, LLC owns the following US patents which are listed in the FDA Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution: US Patent No. 7,288,657, expiring on December 23, 2025; US Patent No. 7,491,736, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,521,041, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,550,595, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,585,879, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,910,608, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,034,946, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,053,448, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,273,894, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,541,451, expiring August 25, 2031; US Patent No. 9,765,028, expiring July 14, 2030; US Patent No. 10,106,503, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 10,343,995, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 10,550,081, expiring July 14, 2030; and US Patent No. 11,008,289, expiring July 14, 2030 (each of the aforementioned expiration dates not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984). Thus, the last to expire patent currently listed in the Orange Book for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution expires on August 25, 2031. On December 19, 2018, we filed patent term extension (“PTE”) applications in the US Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for US Patent Nos. 7,288,657 and 7,585,879. These PTE applications are currently pending and if granted, we will be permitted to extend the term of one of these patents for the period determined by the USPTO. 
​
Issued US and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after their filing date. The patent rights relating to YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution currently consist of issued US patents, pending US patent applications and counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe. Additionally, our patent rights relating to nezulcitinib currently include an issued US composition of matter patent that expires in 2039 (not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984), as well as additional pending patent applications in a number of jurisdictions. Nevertheless, issued patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position, we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position.

Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivities
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within 60 days of approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
​
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for products that would serve as a reference listed drug, or RLD, for an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or application submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or 505(b)(2) application. If a product is a new chemical entity, or NCE — generally meaning that the active moiety has never before been approved in any drug — there is a period of five years from the product’s approval during which the FDA may not accept for filing any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug with the same active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted after four years, however, if the sponsor of the application makes a “Paragraph IV” certification. 
​
A may also qualify for a three-year period of exclusivity if the NDA contains new clinical data (other than bioavailability studies), derived from studies conducted by or for the sponsor, that were necessary for approval. In that instance, the exclusivity period does not preclude filing or review of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application; rather, the FDA is precluded from granting final approval to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until three years after approval of the RLD. Additionally, the exclusivity applies only to the conditions of approval that required submission of the clinical data. 
​
Once the FDA accepts for filing an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to the RLD NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s assertion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. If the NDA holder or patent owner files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months or the resolution of the underlying suit, whichever is earlier. If the RLD has NCE exclusivity and the notice is given and suit filed during the fifth year of exclusivity, the regulatory stay extends until 7.5 years after the RLD approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the regulatory stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.
​
Competition
Our core development programs, and the marketed products to which we are entitled to profit share revenue, royalty or similar payments is focused on respiratory therapeutics. Our commercial infrastructure is focused primarily on the acute care setting. We expect that any respiratory medicines that we commercialize with our collaborative partners or on our own will compete with existing and future market-leading medicines.
​
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:
​

• | discover and develop respiratory medicines that are superior to other products in the market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attract and retain qualified scientific, clinical development and commercial personnel;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | commercialize approved products; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new respiratory medicines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
YUPELRI competes predominately with the nebulized LAMA Lonhala® Magnair® (glycopyrrolate) dosed two times per day and with short acting nebulized bronchodilators that are dosed three to four times per day. 
​
Trelegy or FF/UMEC/VI (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol)
For treatment of COPD, Trelegy competes in all major markets with AstraZeneca’s Breztri® Aerosphere® (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate, dosed twice per day). Trimbow (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide, dosed twice per day) from Chiesi Farmaceutici is an additional COPD competitor in Europe. 
​
For treatment of asthma, TRELEGY is the only triple therapy approved in the US and competes in Japan with Novartis’s Enerzair® Breezhaler® (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate, dosed once daily).
​
In both COPD and asthma, TRELEGY also competes with “open triple” therapy which can be accomplished by the concurrent use of two or three products. An example of such use includes a LABA/ICS combination such as AstraZeneca’s Symbicort and a LAMA such as Boehringer Ingelheim’s Spiriva.
​
Human Capital
​
Workforce Demographics 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 159 employees, 158 full-time and one part-time. Of these employees, 143 were in the US, and 16 were non-US. As previously disclosed, due to the Restructuring event in September 2021, approximately 75% of our headcount was reduced, with approximately 75% of the reduction taking place in November 2021 and the remainder to be completed in February 2022, leaving approximately 106 employees as part of the new structure. 
 ​
Culture and Employee Engagement 
We consider our employee relations first-rate and strive to provide a culture of purpose, engagement, and learning. Theravance has a strong value proposition anchored in our Core Values—We Think it Through, We Find a Way, We Get it Done, and We Win Together. We strive to live these values across the Company every day, integrating them into everything from our interview, hiring, and onboarding processes to our PULSE performance process, total rewards, and recognition programs. In addition to valuing professional qualifications, we emphasize the importance of character and integrity, fostering a culture of empowerment where employees have ownership in business outcomes. Reflected in our Core Values are behaviors that keep our people engaged and working collaboratively. Our employees are encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide input through many forms of corporate communication such as an open-door policy, all-employee meetings, an anonymous online suggestion box, and an employee PULSE survey. 
​
Our employee PULSE survey is designed to assist us in measuring overall employee engagement and consistently achieves participation rates between 85-92%. 2021 survey scores averaged in the positive range from 4.1 to 4.6 on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) through 5 (Strongly Agree). Our highest score on average (4.6) was related to the frequency of discussions with managers. When compared to October 2020, there was a significant increase in the frequency of discussions with managers (from 3.9 to 4.6) and a slight increase in senior leadership communication (from

3.9 to 4.3). These survey results provide important insight into organizational success and opportunity, allowing potential variation in overall satisfaction to be identified and addressed as we move forward.
​
We have significant retention incentives in place post-Restructuring. These include a special incentive compensation program of both long- and short-term offerings and an engagement plan that connects the importance of achieving our core purpose to the strength of our connections and team-building. In addition, through Reimagining Theravance, we empowered and engaged employees to provide feedback on our existing operating model and actively set the foundation for a hybrid-remote operating model to be launched in 2022. Our reimagined operating model celebrates the increased flexibility and productivity many employees reported during remote work while allowing broad access to office workstations and the in-person collaborations that elevate our culture and give us our competitive advantage. 
​
We expect all employees to observe the highest levels of business ethics while delivering the highest levels of performance. These expectations are outlined and reinforced in various documents and forms of communication within and across our Company. The Company encourages employees to speak up and raise questions and concerns promptly about any situation that may violate our Code of Business Conduct, our Core Values, or our policies. We believe that it benefits the entire Company for employees to raise concerns so the Company may consider them carefully and address them appropriately. We seek to promote an environment that fosters honest communications about matters of conduct related to our business activities, whether that conduct occurs within the Company, involves one of the Company’s contractors, suppliers, consultants, clients, or any other party with a business relationship with the Company. We work diligently to make clear that management is prepared to address any reported violations and ensure that it is known that any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. In addition, we have an easily accessible hotline available to employees wishing to report complaints anonymously. ​
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
As an equal opportunity employer, we strive to build and maintain a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion through both our business and human resources practices and policies. We work to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all its forms, including related to color, race, sex or gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, pregnancy, caste, disability, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, religious beliefs, veteran status, uniformed service member status, or physical or mental disability. We strive to build and foster a culture where all employees feel empowered to be their authentic selves. Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council and Women’s Leadership Network are Company-sponsored, employee-led groups that aim to improve attraction, retention, development, inclusion, and engagement of a diverse and global workforce. For the benefit of our employees, patients, and community, we must celebrate, encourage, and support similarities and differences to drive innovation. 
 ​
Talent, Development, and Total Rewards 
We believe that our talent strategy of providing exciting career growth and development opportunities, recognizing and rewarding performance, providing competitive compensation and benefits assists us in attracting and retaining the best talent. We believe we are successful in our retention efforts because we provide challenging work assignments, cross-functional teamwork experiences, and career progression supported by new skill-building. We invest in employee learning and development by identifying and providing training and development programs, speakers, tuition reimbursement, and cross-training in areas of interest beyond hired role. We strive to average between 25-35 training hours per employee per year.
 ​
We offer a competitive total rewards package that supports our business strategy to attract, retain and reward our employees in a highly competitive market. Our employees are provided with a strong base salary, cash bonus opportunities, equity incentives, health and wellness benefits, and programs. We regularly evaluate our compensation programs with an independent consultant and utilize industry benchmarking. In addition, we provide a variety of programs and services that meet our employees' needs and encourage work-life balance. These services include competitive and affordable healthcare and additional insurance benefits for both full-time and part-time employees, including eligible dependents. We also match contributions to tax-qualified defined contribution savings (401k) plans, offer an employee share purchasing plan (“ESPP”), and provide training and development programs designed to improve workplace performance while supporting flexible, hybrid-remote working.

Understanding the importance of goal setting and ongoing career development conversations, Theravance Biopharma requires managers and employees to play an active role in the PULSE performance management process at monthly, quarterly, and annual frequencies. PULSE is designed to increase clarity and accountability for roles and responsibilities, strengthen communication, build trust, all while championing personal and professional growth, learning, and success. 
 ​
Great teamwork is a critical foundation for Theravance Biopharma. The TheraStars Rewards and Recognition Program helps us maintain a culture of recognition and teamwork by offering various options for our employees and managers to recognize and reward colleagues across the organization. In 2021, 97% of our employee population were active registered users, with each user averaging seven awards sent in recognition. These moments of celebration establish, reinforce, and maintain our sense of community and teamwork so critical in our ability to achieve our core purpose. ​
Workplace Safety and COVID-19 
Workplace safety is always a priority for Theravance Biopharma. To maintain a safe and healthy workplace, we have implemented initiatives, procedures, and policies designed to address risk and stay compliant with relevant national and international health and safety standards. 
 ​
In response to COVID-19, our COVID Task Force continues to lead the Company through the evolution of a pandemic with a continued focus on employee wellness and safety, policy updates based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), county, federal and state guidelines, and ongoing employee communication. As part of this evolution, we have an initiative in place to move to a strategically flexible workforce, encouraging a hybrid-remote model, allowing us to reimagine how we work, and propelling us to emerge as a stronger, more nimble company.
