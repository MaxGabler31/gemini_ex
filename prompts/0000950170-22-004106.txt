Overview
 We are a leading cell analysis solutions company advancing the next generation of cell analysis tools by leveraging novel technical approaches. Our goal is to become the premier cell analysis company through continued innovation that facilitates scientific advances in biomedical research and clinical applications. We believe our core instruments, the Aurora and Northern Lights systems, are the first full spectrum flow cytometers able to deliver high-resolution, high-content and high-sensitivity cell analysis by utilizing the full spectrum of fluorescence signatures from multiple lasers to distinguish fluorescent tags on single cells (“Full Spectrum Profiling” or “FSP”). Our novel approach harnesses the power of information within the entire spectrum of a fluorescent signal to achieve a higher level of multiplexing with exquisite sensitivity. Our patented FSP technology optimizes sensitivity and accuracy through its novel optical and electronic designs that utilize an innovative method of light detection and distribution. Our FSP platform includes instruments, reagents, software and services to provide a comprehensive and integrated suite of solutions for our customers. Since our first U.S. commercial launch in mid-2017 through December 31, 2021, we have sold and deployed over 1,000 instruments— primarily comprised of our Aurora and Northern Lights systems—to customers around the world, including the largest pharmaceutical companies, over 150 biopharma companies, leading academic research centers, and clinical research organizations (“CROs”). In June 2021, we commercially launched the Aurora cell sorter (“Aurora CS”), which leverages our FSP technology to further broaden our potential applications across cell analysis.
 Biological systems are highly complex, and scientists are challenged by the multitude of questions that remain unanswered. Analysis at the single-cell level is essential to understand these complex systems. Identifying the correct cell in the context of a given biological question can have profound implications for drug development and health care decisions. It is essential to correlate information derived from multiple cell analysis approaches and to translate what is known at the gene level to the actual cell function. There is growing demand for deep content through high dimensional cell analysis and for solutions that can provide a complete picture of cellular biological processes and interactions. To achieve this, scientists need to phenotype and isolate rare events or unique populations down to the single-cell through highly resolvable multi-dimensional cell analysis. While flow cytometry is a widely used tool for single-cell analysis, conventional flow cytometry, mass cytometry and early approaches to spectral flow cytometry technologies have historically been challenged due to limited dimensionality, sub-optimal resolution, low throughput, high cost for performance and/or significant technical expertise required to operate systems.
 Our FSP platform addresses the inherent limitations of other technologies by providing a higher density of information with greater sensitivity, more flexibility and increased efficiency, all at a lower cost for performance. Our patented FSP technology is designed to optimize sensitivity and accuracy through its novel optical and electronic designs that utilize an innovative method of light detection and distribution to a specifically selected number and type of detectors. This patented optics design enables researchers to effectively collect the full range of light emissions in an extremely compact space, resulting in higher resolution. Our platform also provides higher content by enabling development of highly complex assays with more than 40 different colors (individual fluorochromes) and thus supporting more than 40 biomarkers, all accessible within just a single tube.
 Our solutions have enabled researchers to make significant scientific advances in key areas of medical discovery (such as oncology, immunology and infectious diseases) in addition to empowering improved downstream cell analysis with complementary cell analysis technologies (such as next-generation sequencing (“NGS”)). We believe that our innovative FSP and targeted cell isolation technology has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and have a profound impact on the understanding of cell biology, immunotherapy, and targeted therapeutic approaches (personalized medicine). Further, there has been a meaningful acceleration in the rate of publications generated to showcase our technology, with over 385 peer-reviewed articles published, including many prominent journals, across a wide range of applications including oncology, infectious diseases, immunology, immunotherapy and immuno-oncology.
 Our FSP platform was purpose-built to advance the next generation of cell analysis by delivering deep insights, high-throughputs and ease-of-use. Our FSP platform is designed to offer the following key benefits:
 •Ultra-sensitive: resolve the most challenging cell populations (such as cells with high autofluorescence or low levels of expression of key biomarkers) by providing high-resolution data at the single-cell level with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio.
 •Deep, high integrity content: allow development of highly complex assays through access to more than 40 different colors and thus, supporting more than 40 biomarkers in a single tube without sacrificing precision and throughput to gain a deeper understanding of biological systems and arrive at faster and more accurate diagnoses in clinical settings.


•Flexible and compatible: enable a single configuration across a wide range of reagents and applications, full backwards compatibility across panels, and greater leverage for downstream analysis with complementary technologies, including NGS.
 •Efficient and compact: improve costs and save time while maintaining industry-leading performance and efficient workflows that limit consumables usage and reduce labor costs—all within a highly compact footprint minimizing space requirements for laboratories.
 •Integrated and intuitive: provide fully-integrated workflows through a suite of solutions that include instruments, reagents and kits, software and services. Our proprietary tools and the intuitive functionality of our proprietary SpectroFlo® software coupled with a user-friendly interface allow for enhanced ease-of-use and minimal operator training.
 Our core instruments, the Aurora and Northern Lights systems, are full spectrum flow cytometers founded on our FSP platform technology. The Aurora system—our most advanced and comprehensive offering—is available with three to five lasers and is suitable for customers seeking to access more than 24 colors (with the ability to access more than 40 different colors and support more than 40 biomarkers), while our Northern Lights system—our entry-level offering—is available with one to three lasers and suitable for customers seeking to access a few colors to more than 24 colors. Both instruments are upgradeable based on the desired number of lasers. In June 2021, we commercially launched the Aurora CS, which leverages our FSP technology to rapidly isolate living cell populations from lower-to-higher complexity panels beyond 40 biomarkers. We believe the Aurora CS is the only cell sorter able to accommodate the same number of parameters with the same sensitivity as the Aurora cell analyzer system. Each system is supported by our highly intuitive, proprietary embedded SpectroFlo® software, our reagents, and our service offerings to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end platform of solutions for our customers.
 Within the life sciences technology market, flow cytometry technologies currently provide solutions largely within cell proliferation, cell counting, cell identification, cell quality control and single-cell applications, representing an initial total addressable market of nearly $8 billion. However, we believe that, driven by enhanced capabilities, our FSP platform has the potential to capture an increasingly greater share of the broader cell analysis market, which according to industry sources is expected to grow from roughly $16 billion in 2019 to approximately $23 billion by 2024. Further, we believe our differentiated platform will enable us to expand the use of cell analysis into new markets, well beyond current applications addressed by prior flow cytometry technologies and other cell analysis technologies. Thus, we believe our potential total addressable market is larger than the current cell analysis market, which excludes new and existing markets addressable by our platform, such as applications within immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, bio-processing, infectious diseases, and immuno-deficiencies. In addition, the combination of our platform with complementary, downstream cell analysis technologies is expected to provide additional areas for new applications—for example, combining FSP technology with NGS has demonstrated an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy (such as minimal residual disease (“MRD”) testing) and served to support the use of our technology within personalized medicine. As our FSP platform is further validated through the continued acceleration of peer-reviewed publications in new applications, we expect our total addressable market to expand.
 We believe the combination of our people and our global reach across the United States, Europe and Asia will enable us to continue to execute on our growth strategies, stay ahead of competition and remain at the forefront of innovation in cell analysis. Our leadership team has extensive track records in the life sciences and technology sectors. As of December 31, 2021, we employed a multidisciplinary group of over 500 employees, with more than 160 advanced degrees, including over 60 PhDs and MDs, with expertise across optics, electronics, fluidics, computer sciences, chemistry, biology, and medical sciences. Our worldwide commercial team of more than 120 employees and our research and development team of more than 130 employees have significant expertise, industry experience and collaborative relationships with key opinion leaders (“KOLs”), industry leaders, innovators and potential customers.
 We have a long history of providing high-quality and efficient customer service and our product development efforts reflect our deep understanding of our customers’ needs. One of our key differentiators is our customer-facing technical team, which collaborates closely with our customers to identify and find solutions for unmet needs across the market. We collaborate closely with KOLs, generating relevant data and publications to demonstrate not only the feasibility, but also the quality of our FSP approach. We plan to continue executing on our strategy to accelerate our growth by driving adoption of our FSP solutions, inspiring innovation, investing in integrated workflow solutions, and driving application development and adoption in clinical markets.
 We believe our financial results reflect the significant market demand for our offerings and adoption of our FSP technology: our strong financial profile is differentiated by the combination of our scaled revenue base, high revenue growth and profitability. Our revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $128.0 million and $92.8 million, respectively. We generated net income of $3.0 million and $19.4 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We can provide insights to clinicians to facilitate personalized medicine for patients, as well as facilitate biopharma’s research and development efforts to develop the next-generation of targeted therapies. Our Northern Lights system has been approved for clinical use in the European Union and China and we plan to continue generating supporting publications and data, as well as pursue any required regulatory approvals for clinical use in the United States.
Our Market Opportunity and Industry Background
 Our market opportunity. Within the life sciences technology market, flow cytometry technologies currently provide solutions, including cell proliferation, cell counting, cell identification, cell quality control and single- cell applications, largely within the global cell analysis market. However, we believe that the enhanced capabilities of our FSP platform relative to conventional flow cytometry (“CFCs”), mass cytometry and early approaches to spectral flow cytometry enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of the total addressable market by accessing the entire cell analysis market, which according to industry sources is expected to grow from roughly $16 billion in 2019 to approximately $23 billion by 2024. Further, we believe our differentiated platform will enable us to expand the use of cell analysis into new markets, well beyond current applications addressed by prior flow cytometry technologies and other cell analysis technologies. Thus, we believe our potential total addressable market is larger than the current cell analysis market, which excludes new and existing markets addressable by our platform, such as applications within immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, bio-processing, infectious diseases and immuno-deficiencies. In addition, the combination of our platform with complementary, downstream cell analysis technologies is expected to provide additional areas for new applications—for example, combining FSP technology with NGS has demonstrated an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy (such as MRD testing) and served to support the use of our technology within personalized medicine. As our FSP platform is further validated through the continued acceleration of peer-reviewed publications in new applications, we expect our total addressable market to expand.
 Complementary technologies to FSP and multi-omics applications. Since our FSP platform provides highly complex data down to single-cell resolution at a rapid speed, it is inherently well-suited to drive more targeted and efficient downstream analyses for other

single-cell technologies, such as NGS, single-cell capture and sample preparation, high-resolution microscopy (such as mass imaging cytometry, super resolution microscopy, confocal microscopy and high-throughput screening platforms), and micro and optofluidic systems. FSP is highly complementary to single-cell genomics applications utilizing NGS as it can be used earlier in workflows to rapidly phenotype and isolate living cell populations to the single-cell level with highly multiplexed proteomic data. These cells can then be transferred from our instrument into NGS systems to correlate proteomic and genomic expression, which in turn enables researchers to develop novel drug targets for therapeutics and clinicians to drive outcomes for patients through more informed treatment decision-making. For example, a peer-reviewed article published in the Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation journal recognized that combining multiparameter flow cytometry with NGS resulted in an improved ability to predict leukemia relapse after therapy, demonstrating strong potential utility in the large and growing market for MRD testing. With MRD, end users require high sensitivity and standardization, which makes our FSP technology ideal in addressing these challenges. According to a global MRD testing market report by BIS Research in December 2020, flow cytometry technology has the largest market share in MRD testing among relevant technologies, including NGS, polymerase chain reaction and others.
 Importance of cell analysis at the single-cell level. Due to the heterogeneity within tissues, understanding cellular biology, particularly at the single-cell level, is necessary to unravel mechanisms that might otherwise not be detectable in bulk assays. Deep cellular analysis is a key application that we expect to enable a new age of healthcare delivery, and in particular, personalized medicine. The global healthcare market requires advanced cell analysis technologies to research therapeutic and diagnostic solutions to address emerging and chronic infectious diseases, an aging population with a myriad of chronic diseases, and the need for more effective and targeted therapeutics. These primary market forces, among others, will drive the direction for cell analysis applications that provide new possibilities for novel drug development and improved patient outcomes through enhanced disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring.
 
OUR PRODUCTS
 We are a leading cell analysis solutions provider that develops compact, cost-effective full spectrum profiling instruments with high multiplexing capability, and we offer a wide range of services to support scientists and clinicians. Our products are used in the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical and clinical research organizations, as well as premier academic and research institutions.
Aurora and Northern Lights Systems
 Our Aurora and Northern Lights systems were commercially launched in June 2017 and October 2018, respectively. Both instruments are highly flexible, intuitive, and ultra-sensitive full spectrum flow cytometers, utilizing state-of-the-art optics and low-noise electronics to provide excellent sensitivity and resolution, allowing researchers to resolve rare cell populations that were previously challenging to resolve. The optics and electronics designs, combined with flat-top beam profiles and a unique vacuum fluidics system, translate to outstanding performance from low to high sample flow rate, analyzing up to 35,000 events per second with certain configurations. Additionally, our optical design and unmixing algorithm make the instrument amenable to a wide array of applications and fluorochrome options, all without needing to reconfigure the instrument hardware as would otherwise be required on a CFC.
 The Aurora system is available with three to five lasers and can detect more than 40 biomarkers in one sample tube. The Northern Lights system is available with one to three lasers and can detect more than 24 biomarkers in one sample tube. Both instruments are upgradeable based on the desired number of lasers, which drives greater or less access to biomarkers. In addition, both instruments incorporate our SpectroFlo® software, which offers an intuitive workflow from quality control to sample acquisition to data analysis, with technology- enabling tools that simplify running applications.
 Our Aurora and Northern Lights systems are used in the study of infectious diseases, immunology, immunotherapy, immuno-oncology, oncology, inflammation, and drug discovery.
 The Northern Lights CLC system was certified under the European Union In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (IVDD) in September 2020 and is registered as an in vitro diagnostic medical device under Northern Lights Clinical Flow Cytometer. The certification enables the Northern Lights CLC system to be sold into in vitro diagnostic laboratories in the European Union and in other countries around the world that accept this specific certification. The Northern Lights CLC system is also certified for in vitro diagnostic use as a Class II device in China.
 Aurora CS System
 Key to the discovery of unraveling cellular complexity is the ability to perform additional downstream genomic and proteomic studies on the specific subsets identified using high dimensional phenotyping approaches. Our Aurora CS was commercially launched in June 2021 and is the first highly flexible, intuitive and ultra-sensitive cell sorter that leverages the detection and sensitivity capabilities of our FSP technology to isolate living cell populations from lower to higher complexity panels beyond 40 biomarkers. Our FSP technology enables the processing of a tremendous amount of highly complex information to provide real- time unmixing and sorting

capabilities at the field-programmable gate array level. The implications are significant in terms of flexibility and user experience, including experiment workflow transportability and assay reproducibility, enabling a 40-biomarker assay to be run in both the Aurora and the Aurora CS systems, with similar results. With our technology, users can first identify cell populations and then isolate the live cells for downstream studies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and cell biology. We believe this new technology will enable users to gain a deeper level of cell classification, take advantage of key trends and scientific expansion, and allow for greater applications in the research and clinical settings, such as with MRD, cell analysis and disease discovery.
 Unlike other high-capacity sorters, we believe the Aurora CS is the only cell sorter that can accommodate the same number of parameters with the same sensitivity as the Aurora system and isolate living cell populations of interest using the same panel and without having to alter the optical configuration, while also being able to sort panels designed for conventional analyzers.
 Reagents and Kits
 We also have launched our reagent products to provide additional options for researchers and clinical laboratories when choosing which biomarkers to run together in a panel, particularly since our Aurora, Northern Lights and Aurora CS systems allow for more fluorochromes to be run together than was previously commercially available. Our technology was able to inform our fluorochrome development through the identification of areas within the spectrum for which there were currently no available fluorochrome options. Our cFluor® reagents are fluorochrome conjugated antibodies used to identify cells of interest for analysis on our instruments. We offer and continue to develop cFluor® immunoprofiling kits, which include the cFluor® reagents and tools necessary to simplify the workflow from sample preparation to data analysis.
In addition to our 14-color immunoprofiling kit launched in December 2020, which is designed to distinguish different subsets of T, B and natural killer (“TBNK”) cells, we launched our 25-color immunoprofiling assay in October 2021 to provide a turnkey solution for identifying major human immune subpopulations for TBNK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and basophils – all of which play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune response in various diseases. Both of these products are optimized for use with our Aurora system and designed to simplify the workflow for our customers.
 Our Class 1 registered single-color reagents are sold in China and we are evaluating 6-color reagent cocktails that identify and determine the percentages and absolute counts of TBNK cells in peripheral blood (“TBNK reagents”). The TBNK reagent clinical studies have been completed with data from 700 patients. We are currently planning to seek Class 3 registration with China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). We expect these recent and planned reagent and application solutions to be a significant driver of our future reagent revenue and pull-through as our installed base of instruments grows.
To help accelerate our overarching goal to become a comprehensive solutions provider to our customers, we acquired the reagents business of Tonbo Biotechnologies Corporation in November 2021.
 Automated Micro-Sampling System and Automated Sample Loader System
Our Automated Micro-Sampling (“AMS”) system and Automated Sample Loader (“ASL”) system were commercially launched in 2018 and 2021, respectively. The AMS and ASL systems are automated plate loaders designed to integrate seamlessly into the Aurora and Northern Lights systems to increase sample throughput and add automation capabilities while using our FSP systems. The systems offer preset and fully customizable settings that allow the loader to be fine-tuned to each researcher’s experimental requirements. Their reliable 96-well plate acquisition solution maximizes productivity. The ASL also provides compatibility with 40-tube racks and suggested settings for each carrier type, which are fully customizable for unique applications and cell types to provide added versatility to researchers. Both systems have three throughput modes (high- throughput, default, low carryover) to meet changing customer priorities and provide optional automation capability for our Aurora and Northern Lights systems.
 SpectroFlo® Software
 Our proprietary SpectroFlo® software is integrated into our systems and is unique in that it offers an intuitive workflow from quality control to data analysis for our Aurora and Northern Lights systems. The software was developed specifically to streamline assay setup, data acquisition and file export and includes an automated quality control module. With the ability to import a previously designed experiment template, users are able to quickly set up their experiments and there is no need to re-enter or recreate controls, acquisition criteria, reagent information or data analysis worksheets. With our SpectroFlo® software, users can conveniently and efficiently achieve live unmixing during acquisitions, autofluorescence extraction and obtain raw and unmixed FCS 3.1 files, the data standard for flow cytometry. With the SpectroFlo® experiment workflow, users can start an experiment and gain data in three simple guided steps.
 Customer Support Tools
 We strive to continually innovate by developing new quantitative tools, which are integrated into our software or available to our customers on our website, to enable users to independently create high- color panels for use with our systems, to support efficient workflow solutions and to provide an intuitive user experience. As fluorochrome (color) selection is a key component of assay

development and optimization, our full spectrum viewer is a unique tool capable of displaying the full emission spectrum of a fluorochrome (emission at different wavelengths post-excitation with multiple lasers). Our FSP technology provides an in-depth understanding of the fluorescence emission characteristics of nearly every color available in the market and our full spectrum viewer provides users with comprehensive information regarding emission characteristics of the fluorochromes to optimize fluorochrome selection for assay development. As a complementary tool to our full spectrum viewer, we have developed the Similarity and the Complexity indices, which provide unique metrics for assessing fluorochrome compatibility within a panel. The Similarity index compares the emission spectrum of two dyes, identifying whether the dyes have unique characteristics or if the dyes are identical, which determines whether they can be used together to analyze a sample in a flow cytometry assay. The Complexity index is a metric that predicts how well a panel of colors will work in combination to minimize loss of resolution and sensitivity.
 DxP Athena
 Our DxP Athena conventional flow cytometry system commercially launched in 2016 and is currently available for sale only in China. It is certified for clinical use by China NMPA. The DxP Athena system incorporates DxP technology with efficient PMTs to enable high sensitivity and high resolution and our proprietary QbSure software to ensure optimal daily instrument performance. The system is available in multiple configurations with one to three lasers and up to 13 fluorescence detection channels. The automated monthly clean bleach cycle minimizes downtime, streamlines maintenance and encourages compliance.
 SALES AND MARKETING
 We distribute our products through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, China and several countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and through distributors or sales agents in several countries in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at academic and governmental institutions, CROs, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and clinical laboratories focused on single-cell analysis.
 Our sales process often involves interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments on our system and competing systems. In addition, in many countries outside of North America, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, the sales cycle on our instrument, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can be six months or longer.
 MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
 Our manufacturing operations are located in Fremont and San Diego, California and Wuxi, China. We commenced manufacturing operations in Fremont, California in 2015. Our Fremont facility maintains ISO 9001 certification and manufactures our Aurora and Aurora CS systems, as well as our reagents and spare parts. Our Wuxi manufacturing facility commenced operations in 2017 and maintains ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certification. Our Wuxi facility manufactures our Northern Lights and Athena instruments, reagents and spare parts and delivers certain instruments to our Fremont facilities for final assembly and testing. Our instruments and reagents for clinical use are currently manufactured only in our Wuxi facility.
 We established the manufacturing facility in Wuxi, China to take advantage of the skilled workforce, supplier and partner network, lower operating costs and available government support. We are able to hire skilled employees from China’s existing in vitro diagnostic and optical product industry. China also has a broad network of potential suppliers and partners for our manufacturing operations and we are able to locally source a large portion of the raw materials required for our manufacturing processes. We have received incentive grants from the local Wuxi government for research, development, and manufacturing.
 We believe that having dual sources for our core products would help mitigate the potential impact of a production disruption at any one of our facilities to ensure a reliable and stable supply chain and product availability for our customers. We relocated our Fremont headquarters and manufacturing facility in October 2021 to provide us with capacity expansion capability that would be sufficient to support our growth. We expect that our existing manufacturing capacity for instrumentation and reagents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for at least the next several years.
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in our systems. Key components in our products that are supplied by sole or limited source suppliers include certain lasers, semiconductors and mechanical components that are used in our optical, electrical and fluidic subassemblies. While we are in the process of qualifying additional sources of supply, qualifications can take 12 to 24 months and, in some cases, longer. If we were to lose one or more of our sole or limited source suppliers, it would take significant time and effort to qualify alternative suppliers. With respect to many of our suppliers, we are neither a major customer, nor do we have long term supply contracts. These suppliers may therefore give other customers’ needs higher priority than ours, and we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms.


COMPETITION
 We face significant competition from within the life sciences tools market. We currently compete with established and emerging life sciences companies developing or commercializing flow cytometry and mass cytometry instruments, as well as other companies that design, manufacture and market instruments, consumables, reagent kits and software for, among other applications, cell analysis, immunophenotyping, cell sorting and/or provide services related to the same. Our direct competitors include Agilent Technologies, Beckman Coulter (Danaher Corporation), Becton, Dickinson and Company, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Fluidigm Corporation, Miltenyi Biotec, Sony Biotechnology (Sony Corporation) and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on CFCs, or using traditional methods, rather than implementing our platform and may decide to stop using our platform. In addition, there are many large, established companies in the life sciences tools market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop instruments, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces.
 For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk factors— Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy—The market for cell analysis technologies and life sciences tools, including flow cytometry, is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.”
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how; to defend and enforce our parents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We have developed our own portfolio of issued patents and patent applications directed at our core and system level technology, including claims directed to methods and apparatus of flow cytometers and cell sorters with excitation, fluidics, emission, mechanical, magnetic, electronics, bio-safety and temperature control technology in configurations of our Aurora, Aurora CS, Northern Lights and Northern Lights CLC systems. We generally seek patent protection in the United States, Japan, China and selected countries of the European Union, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of December 31, 2021, we own ten issued U.S. utility patents and one issued Japan utility patent. We have 34 pending utility patent applications, including 18 utility patent applications in the United States, six utility patent applications in the European Union, six utility patent applications in China and four utility patent applications in Japan. In April 2021, we filed two different provisional patent applications in the United States directed to technology integrated into our cell sorter. In November 2021, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States directed to scattered light detection technology. Assuming all maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. issued patents are expected to naturally expire between years 2023 and 2038.Patents covering intellectual property relating to design specific technologies invented by our researchers in Shanghai and Wuxi, China are filed in China and owned by our China subsidiaries, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our Shanghai subsidiary owns 14 issued utility patents and has 9 pending invention patent applications, and our Wuxi subsidiary owns 19 issued patents and has 16 pending patent applications, including nine pending utility patent applications and seven pending invention patent applications.
 To our knowledge, there are no third party claims or contested proceedings with the issued patents or pending patent applications other than the ordinary course proceedings with pending patent applications before the respective patent offices. However, the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our patents may not enable us to obtain or keep any competitive advantage. Our pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination, opposition or other administrative proceeding, or may be challenged in litigation, and such challenges could result in a determination that the patent is invalid. In addition, competitors may be able to design alternative methods or devices that avoid infringement of our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which our products compete. Because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us, which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe. To the extent our intellectual property protection offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate protection against our competitors’ products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.


In addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate.
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties have asserted and may assert in the future that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. Competitors may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into those markets and there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In addition, our competitors and others may have patents or may in the future obtain patents and claim that use of our products infringes these patents. We could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending any of these claims. Parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products. We may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all.

 On September 1, 2020, we entered into a Supply and License Agreement with Biotium, Inc. (“Biotium”) pursuant to which Biotium agreed to supply, and we obtained a worldwide, non-exclusive license to market and resell to our customers and distributors, certain Biotium products to conjugate proteins and/or antibodies and to use such conjugates as a component in our cFluor reagent products, for research and analyte specific reagents (as defined by 21 CFR 864.4020) use only (the “Field of Use”) (the “Biotium Agreement”). In consideration for such rights, we paid Biotium an upfront fee of $20,000 and will pay Biotium royalties at a mid-to-high single digit percentage rate on worldwide net sales on licensed products within the Field of Use. The Biotium Agreement terminates on the expiration of the last to expire of the valid claims of the Biotium patents subject to the Biotium Agreement. Either party may terminate the Biotium Agreement for the other party’s bankruptcy or uncured material breach or if no Biotium product is purchased for an extended period; however, if such termination is by Biotium, we will have the opportunity to make a purchase following written notice from Biotium to avoid such termination. Our license under the Biotium Agreement does not include diagnostic use, which may be added through an amendment and additional payment to Biotium.
Becton, Dickinson and Company Settlement, License and Equity Issuance Agreement
 On February 13, 2018, BD filed a lawsuit against us alleging trade secret misappropriation and copyright infringement. On October 6, 2020, we entered into a Settlement, License and Equity Issuance Agreement with BD pursuant to which we and BD agreed to a mutual release of all claims against each other as of the date thereof (the “BD Agreement”). As part of the settlement, BD granted us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, and non-transferrable license to certain BD patents and covenanted that it would not enforce, or permit or encourage the enforcement of BD patents against us or our affiliates in connection with the development, manufacture, use, importation, offer for sale or sale of our then-current instruments. In exchange, we agreed that we and our affiliates would not dispute or challenge in a legal proceeding the validity, enforceability or scope of the applicable BD patent claims and agreed to make certain payments to BD, including (i) a one-time upfront payment of $2.0 million, (ii) a low single digit royalty payment for ten years, based on net sales of certain of our products, (iii) a $6.0 million milestone payment upon the occurrence of a certain sales threshold, and (iv) a specified payment upon the closing of a change of control transaction, if any.

We provide Coherent with rolling forecasts of our anticipated orders, which are non-binding. We do not have a minimum purchase obligation pursuant to the Coherent Agreement. The Coherent Agreement has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for a subsequent one-year period unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least four (4) months prior to the expiration of the initial term. The Coherent Agreement may be terminated prior to the end of its term upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 We are focused on developing innovative products to meet unmet market needs and maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment where employees are respected and encouraged to share their unique perspectives and ideas. As of December 31, 2021, we had 502 employees, of which 496 are full-time employees, including 134 employees in research and development, 122 employees in sales and marketing, 195 employees in manufacturing and operations, and 51 employees in general and administrative. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our employees are neither represented by a labor union nor party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that we have strong employee relations.
Culture and Values
 We seek to maintain high ethical standards and a culture that values honesty, integrity, accountability and transparency in all that we do. We are committed to our employees and to the communities we serve worldwide. It is our philosophy to foster open communication and our employees are encouraged to provide input on ways to improve our business strategy and tactics, work environment and organization. We believe that our ability to provide employees with a dynamic environment and professional growth opportunities drives a culture embedded in our values.
Business Ethics
 We are committed to conducting our business activities with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, communities and stockholders with integrity and fairness and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We believe that our conduct has a direct impact on our reputation, our brand and our stakeholders. We are focused on ensuring that our legal, compliance and risk mitigation protocols further enhance our ability to comport ourselves with the highest levels of ethical standards.
Talent Attraction, Retention and Engagement
 By focusing on individual performance, as well as teamwork and collaboration, we believe that we foster an environment that helps employees excel as individuals and as team members. To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer programs and avenues for support, motivation and professional development. For example, we utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to deliver proprietary, targeted training courses designed to position our commercial organization as the leading cell analysis solutions provider. For our talent pipeline development, we work closely with individual business functions to provide training and hands-on support for managers and leaders.
Compensation Philosophy
 We strive to provide comprehensive compensation, including cash, equity, benefits and services that attract, motivate and retain exceptional employees. Compensation is driven by local market conditions, internal equity and employee performance.
Health and Wellness
 We offer a comprehensive package including: 401(k) plan with a company-match component, medical, dental and vision insurance, life insurance, short-and long-term disability insurance, 18 paid vacation days per year or flexible time off (depending on employee level), paid days for illness and family emergencies, and health savings and flexible spending accounts.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 Our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives and biologics. Our research operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. Given the small volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities, we do not expect our compliance efforts to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages and suspension of our operations.
