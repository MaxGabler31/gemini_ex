ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Prior to the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary as described below, our main business consisted of the manufacture and sale of a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) we developed known as the BDI-747 Ignition Interlock Device (the “BDI-747/1”), which is a mechanism that is installed on the steering column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales prior to starting their vehicle. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration analysis. If the driver’s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition from engaging and the automobile from starting. These devices are often required for use by DUI or DWI (“driving under the influence” or “driving while intoxicated”) offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program.
Current Business
 
Shortly after changing our business focus towards the eSports industry, which we regard as a potentially high growth and profitable industry, we identified certain opportunities to engage in the business related to e-sports in Southeast Asia, which has seen high growth over the last 3 years, and determined that we should pursue that business opportunity. We entered into negotiations with Leet Technology Limited (“LTL”), and have closed that acquisition as of November 18, 2020.
 
Currently, the Company is a holding company and has no principal business other than LTL’s business. As a result of the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement (“SEA”), LTL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which operates an eSports platform in Malaysia. All references to Company herein include its operating subsidiary LTL, Leet Entertainment Group Limited, and Leet Entertainment Sdn. Bhd. unless otherwise noted.
 
We are a technology company developing and operating platforms focused on eSports. We operate a community eSport gaming platform called Matchroom.net, which was launched in January 2019 and aims to cover a wide range of gaming and digital entertainment services catering to the Asia Pacific community.
 
Esports Industry and Segment
 
Definition of eSports:
 
Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.

Growth of eSports
 
 The eSports industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The majority of these revenues come from sponsorships and advertising, and the rest from media rights, publisher fees, merchandise and tickets, digital and streaming.

Our Focus and Strategy
 
Even while the market for potential customer growth is there, the telecommunication industry (“telco”) has been seeing stagnant revenue growth and shrinking margins. The telcos have built the expensive infrastructure for streaming, but it has the technology companies such as the OTT service companies that have been monetizing the network. OTTs are online mobile applications that are typically provided by third parties through app stores and often consume significant mobile network bandwidth. With billions of users, OTT services already have huge scale and still have further growth potential. In recent years, there has been a boom in OTT media services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Skype, etc.) that have found effective ways to operate on top of the telco infrastructure, streaming content or providing VoIP services to end consumers (Source:  https://www.visualcapitalist.com/telcos-gaming-rise-esports/). Although telcos arguably missed the boat on video streaming, voice, and messaging, there is now an emerging segment that could help fill the gap. The rising popularity of eSports has been identified as the multi-billion dollar industry that provides telcos a much-needed growth area to better monetize their infrastructure.
 
Already worth over $1 billion, the eSports market is projected by experts to triple by 2025 (Source:  https://www.visualcapitalist.com/telcos-gaming-rise-esports/). An important feature for an enjoyable gaming experience is the need for speed, which telcos are uniquely positioned to provide, especially with the advent of edge computer technology and 5G. A sophisticated edge computing system will be able to detect where each player is located, while creating a server in an optimal location that provides all the players with the same high bandwidth, low latency, and experience. By leveraging technology that enables edge computing at scale, forward-looking telcos can take gamers to where they want to go – and with plenty of value-adds.
 
Accordingly, we have decided to dedicate our initial focus and growth strategy in partnering with telcos to provide a fast end-to-end branded eSports solution at competitive costs to increase monetization and drive data usage. With OTT operators, we hope to partner with them to offer value-added services on their platforms to increase usability and more avenues for revenue. Finally, we offer a quick and cost-effective online gaming solution and online gaming hosting service on Matchroom.net in concert with tournament, event organizers and brand promoters.

Market, Customer and Distribution Methods
 
Our focus in regards of target markets encompasses the emerging markets (South East Asia, Middle East, and South Asia) in terms of geography, and users between the ages of 17 – 35. As most of these markets are mobile centric, our focus is mainly towards mobile e-sport tournaments. As such, we also focus on working with mobile network operators in our target markets, as they have direct access to their mobile subscribers, which are our target audience as well.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales strategy is geared towards a subscription model, at which users subscribe to a tournament pass that allows them to participate in a series of tournaments which has prize pools and benefits. Our partnerships with mobile network operators extend our payment reach through direct carrier billings with the mobile network operators in the respective countries in which we work.
 
By building up the community of e-sports players, brands can sponsor some of these prize pools by offering product ad placements, sampling and giveaways. This will be further amplified by offerings of ecommerce opportunities for brands to sell their product on our platform.
 
Our marketing strategy revolves around digital marketing through social media, brand marketing, influencer marketing and working with mobile carriers to co-promote our tournaments.
 
Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction in which we conduct our current business. As of now, there are no additional required government approvals which we must obtain.
Competition
 
Currently, most of our competitors are localized in the markets where we penetrated. So far, most if not all our competitors focus on one area only. Either they are end user platform or a white label platform.
 
For Matchroom, we have more competitors but mainly localized to the country they reside in. We have Yamisok in Indonesia, ESPL in Singapore, MESF in Malaysia and Mogul.gg out of Australia. Due to language barriers, payments and differences in cultures, large competitors tend to look at the home countries to build their brand and partners.
 
For white label services, we have two main competitors which is Technineer (telco focused) in Malaysia and Goama (OTT focused) in Singapore that has been whitelabelling either an esports or an arcade platform for both Telco and OTT operators. The white label platform services remain a niche sector as of now as it is often a slow and tedious process of onboarding with telco and payment terms of being 90 days. For most companies this is a deterrent to enter. However, this is still a race as once you are onboarded, you tend to be operating with the telco over a long period of time.

Business Plan 
 
Throughout 2021 we saw most countries and economies still dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic with new strains of the virus keeping travel and restrictions in place. With on-ground events halted, the eSports industry shifted heavily onto the online space. Online viewership has increase significantly alongside with the growth of the internet penetrations namely 5G Mobile networks and higher internet data consumption. This led to many Telco operators looking at capitalizing on these growths with increased interest in the esports sector.
 
Unfortunately in the midst of the pandemic, several of our Telco and OTT projects which we targeted to launch in Q3 & Q4 of 2021 were also delayed. In February of 2022, we have launched our white label partnership with Smart Communications which is the largest telco operator in Philippines, and we are slated to launch another regional telco partnership in June 2022.
 
In 2022 we will focus on working on a B2B (Business to Business) model with mobile network operators within Southeast Asia and other continents to extend our platform’s (Maverick) product offerings via a white label model, of which our telco subscribers will subscribe to a data package that offers a tournament pass granting users to compete in a series of tournaments on the platform.
 
Maverick is a rebrand of our whitelabel product offering a scalable and modular gaming platform solution to Telco and OTT providers giving them an extensive choice of various features and monetization modules which would fit their subscribers and market demography. Matchroom will continue to focus on providing esports managed services to our partners through these telco partnerships.
 
The Company will focus on delivering an integrated end-to-end gaming platform to the markets through the following:
 
1) Continuous development and enhancements of our white label product, Maverick, with the latest and relevant features and functionalities. With the modular-approach, our telco partners is able to select the features and best suited business model for their respective markets.
 
2) Focus on providing business, technical and operations managed services to our telco partners to ensure professional level of tournament and platform management while working hand in hand with our telco on marketing the platform to their users.
 
3) Build further revenue enhancements feature as part of the platform such as onboarding of games, ecommerce, and content to further drive new/incremental revenue stream, and user engagement within the platform increasing its retention capability of the gaming platform for our telco partners.
 
Based on our current roadmap, we intend to cover Southeast Asia, and parts of South Asia, namely Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Cambodia within the next 12 months. The following 24 months in 2023 to 2024 will see us incorporating Vietnam, South Asia, Middle East, and African markets into our platform.
 
To cater to our expansion, our platform roadmap also focuses on several priorities:
 
1) Enhancement of our current platform to enable deep linking with mobile carriers
 2) Launch of a redemption and ecommerce platform
 3) Enhancements of our current esports tools and services
 4) Gamifications and user experience enhancements
 5) Multi language and geographical-led content management.
 6) Software development kits (SDK) for better onboarding of game developers and tournament operators.
 7) Customer engagement and community management tools for better customer experience.

We will also need to recruit computer gaming employees and consultants, and executives that will lead localized teams across the region, especially in Philippines, Indonesia, and South Asia where there is a distinct local culture that calls for localization of content in that particular country. We also expect to expand our development and operations team to cater to more tournaments including automations, data mining, customer retentions & userbase including monetization strategies.
 
We expect our revenues to grow in 2022 onwards, especially through our mobile carrier partnerships as well as our subscription model which is expected to in line with our user growth and platform deliverables.
