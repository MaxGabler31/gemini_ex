ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (“TMHC”) is one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States and has been named America's Most Trusted Homebuilder® for seven consecutive years (as awarded by Lifestory Research). We are also a land developer, with a portfolio of lifestyle and master-planned communities. We provide an assortment of homes across a wide range of price points to appeal to an array of consumer groups. We design, build and sell single and multi-family detached and attached homes in traditionally high growth markets for entry level, move-up, and 55-plus active lifestyle (formerly referred to as active adult) buyers. We operate under various brand names including Taylor Morrison, Darling Homes Collection by Taylor Morrison, and Esplanade. We have grown organically and through multiple builder acquisitions. We completed five acquisitions within a five year period from 2015 through 2020. These acquisitions marked our initial entrance into several markets from the Southeastern part of the United States to the Pacific Northwest. Such markets included Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, Las Vegas, Seattle and Portland. 
We leverage our core homebuilding and land acquisition expertise in alternative ways by operating strategic real estate related businesses. 
•We provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding, Inc. (“TMHF”), title insurance and closing settlement services through our title company, Inspired Title Services, LLC (“Inspired Title”), and homeowner’s insurance policies through our insurance agency, Taylor Morrison Insurance Services, LLC (“TMIS”). 
•Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we also develop and construct multi-use properties consisting of commercial space, retail, and multi-family properties under the Urban Form brand name, 
•We have an exclusive partnership with Christopher Todd Communities, a growing Phoenix-based developer of innovative, luxury rental communities to operate a “Build-to-Rent” homebuilding business. We serve as a land acquirer, developer, and homebuilder while Christopher Todd Communities provides community design and property management consultation. We are in multiple markets including Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Phoenix, Tampa, and Sarasota. We plan to expand into additional markets during 2022. We began accepting leases in the Phoenix market in 2021, with move in dates in 2022. We also anticipate homes in additional markets will be available for rent during 2022, and once the communities reach stabilized rental levels, we will evaluate potential exit/hold for investment strategies.
We have operations in eleven states, and our business is organized into multiple homebuilding operating components and a financial services component, which are managed as multiple reportable segments, as follows:

East | Atlanta, Charlotte, Jacksonville, Naples, Orlando, Raleigh, Sarasota, and Tampa 
Central | Austin, Dallas, Denver, and Houston 
West | Bay Area, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento, Seattle, and Southern California 
Financial Services | Taylor Morrison Home Funding, Inspired Title Services and Taylor Morrison Insurance Services

Business Strategy
We have short and long-term priorities and strategies which are built on the following pillars:
Short-term priorities 
•streamlining our processes to build operational effectiveness;
•continue to employ strategic land initiatives to improve capital position;
•product optimization, innovation, simplification and standardization;
•continuing to enhance the customer experience; and 
•expanding our Build-to-Rent operations. 
Long-term strategies
•opportunistic land acquisition of prime assets in core locations;
•building distinctive communities driven by consumer preferences;
•maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and
•appropriately balancing price with pace in the sale of our homes.
Our short-term priorities were established to enhance and refine our current operations. As a result of our acquisitions over the years, we have focused on integrating multiple companies, and now we believe we are well positioned to implement processes and procedures throughout our organization which will enhance efficiency and ultimately, operational effectiveness. 
Land infrastructure has always been a long-term strategy for our business, and we believe we have been successful in locating and purchasing land in desirable locations which offer strong returns. In addition, we have and will continue to take advantage of joint venture and land banking opportunities as they arise in order to secure prime assets, share risk and maximize returns.
We have focused on identifying key locations and markets to successfully launch our operations of Build-to-Rent. We accepted leases in the Phoenix market during 2021, with move in dates in 2022. We also anticipate homes in additional markets will be available for rent during 2022. We are evaluating the initial results to allow for us to make any necessary changes or enhancements as we launch in other markets.
Our long-term strategies continue to serve us well. We maintain our commitment to building authentic homes and communities that inspire and enhance the lives of our customers. Delivering on this commitment requires thoughtful design and research to accommodate the needs of our various customers and the surrounding community. The Taylor Morrison difference begins by providing our customers with homes that are both conducive to their lifestyles and built to last, prioritizing our commitment for the long-term satisfaction of our homeowners. Our communities are generally “lifestyle” communities in core locations, which have various distinguishing attributes, including proximity to job centers, attractive school systems and a variety of local amenities in well-regarded submarkets.
Our dedication to service defines our customer experience and acknowledges homeowners’ suggestions to incorporate style, quality and sustainability into every community we develop. We offer a range of award-winning and innovative designs with a number of features such as single-story, multi-story, multi-family, higher density living, ranch style living, split bedroom plans and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to diverse buyer needs. We engage architectural firms and internal architectural resources to develop and augment existing plans in order to ensure that our homes reflect current and local consumer tastes. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency and cost savings to reduce the impact on the environment. Our TM LiveWell program 
provides homeowners with a robust suite of healthy home features and technologies focused on providing healthier air, cleaner water, and safer paint. 
We acquire our land assets in core locations, focusing on the preferences of our buyers, building desirable communities, continually evaluating and analyzing overhead efficiency and optimizing profit by managing volume. In addition, we seek to maximize long-term shareholder value and operate our business to capitalize on market dynamics and mitigate risks from economic downturns as we recognize the cyclical nature of the housing industry. We regularly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder return. This strategy is built on several primary pillars - 
•reinvest in core homebuilding operations, 
•seek additional growth opportunities through mergers, acquisitions, other land investment and joint venture strategies, 
•optimize debt leverage, 
•reinvest in ancillary business opportunities within the industry, and
•the repurchase of our common stock. 
We believe our land positioning and pipeline have positioned us for strategic growth. We execute this strategy by:
•Optimizing our existing land supply through enhanced product offerings;
•Combining land acquisition and development expertise with homebuilding operations;
•Focusing product offerings on specific consumer segments;
•Building quality homes for our customers and focusing on superior customer service;
•Maintaining an efficient capital structure;
•Selectively pursuing acquisitions; and
•Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record.
Land and Development Strategies
Community development includes the acquisition and development of land, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. We generally operate as community developers, but in some communities we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case we acquire fully entitled and developed lots. 
In order to maximize our risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Our portfolio investment committee of senior executives meets on a regular basis. Annually, our operating divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographies. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Supply and demand are analyzed on a consumer segment and submarket basis to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary. Strategic decisions regarding community positioning are included in the decision making and underwriting process and are made in consultation with senior executives of our management team. 
We are party to various land banking arrangements which allow us to acquire land in staged takedowns, while limiting risk and retaining cash. These third-party entities use equity contributions from their owners and/or incur debt to finance the acquisition and development of the land. Such lots are included in our controlled lots for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our land portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 is summarized below:

(1) Other assets are owned lots, but not considered in our total homebuilding owned lots.
Raw land represents property that has not been developed and remains in its natural state. Partially developed represents land where the grading and horizontal development process has begun. Finished lots represent those lots which we have purchased from third parties in addition to lots for which we have completed the horizontal development process and are ready for the vertical or homebuilding construction. Long-term strategic assets are those lots where we are currently not performing any development. Controlled lots represent lots in which we have a contractual right, generally through an option contract or land banking arrangement, to an underlying real estate asset. Other assets include a combination of commercial parcels and residential lots. 
In the land purchasing and/or consideration of joint ventures, specific projects of interest are typically identified and placed under contract by the local teams. Such teams carry out a robust due diligence and feasibility process evaluating key factors which include, but are not limited to, environmental concerns, estimated budgets for development and home construction, anticipated product segmentation, competitive environment, ownership structure, and financial returns. Findings are summarized and presented to our portfolio investment committee for review. Certain portfolio opportunities will often be sourced centrally and managed at the corporate level. We also determine whether continued spending on currently owned and controlled land is a well-timed and appropriate use of capital. Our portfolio investment strategy emphasizes expected profitability to reflect the risk and timing of returns, and the level of sales volume in new and existing markets.

The following is a summary of units in inventory by homebuilding reporting segment as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

(2)Previously referred to as speculative homes.
Community Development
We create a complete development concept for each community, beginning with an overall community layout and then determine the size, style and price range of the homes, the layout of the streets and positioning of the individual home sites. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we improve the land by clearing and grading, installing roads, underground utility lines, staking out individual home sites and, in certain communities, building distinctive entrance structures and recreational amenities.
Each community has employees who perform construction management, sales and customer service functions, in conjunction with a local management team to manage the overall project.
The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase, and concluding with the sale, construction, and delivery of homes. Actual life cycle will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as developed lots.
The construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of construction, the governmental approval processes, local labor availability, availability of materials and supplies, weather, and other factors. On average, we complete the construction of a typical home in approximately six months.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We experienced numerous, generally widespread, supply chain disruptions caused by labor and material shortages throughout 2021 with the second half of the year being the most heavily impacted. These shortages resulted in significant cost inflation and negatively impacted the timing of our closings.
Trade Labor
Our construction, land and purchasing teams coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We are a general contractor for all of our homebuilding projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices can be challenging in some markets as a result of the uneven industry growth and recent economic factors such as supply chain disruptions. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also been challenged by limitations on the number of tradespeople permitted at construction sites as a result of social distancing measures.
Procurement and Construction
We have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and national presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize cost and process efficiencies on local, regional and national levels and to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements.
The regional and national vendor programs currently involve over 60 vendors and include highly reputable and well-established companies that supply us with lumber, appliances, HVAC systems, insulation, roofing, paint and lighting, among other materials. Through these relationships, we are able to realize savings on the costs of essential materials. Contracts are typically structured to include a blend of attractive upfront pricing and rebates and, in some cases, advantageous retroactive pricing in instances of contract renewals. In addition to cost advantages, these arrangements also help minimize the risk of construction delays during supply shortages, as we are often able to leverage our size to obtain our full allocation of required materials.
Warranty Program
Our homebuilding operations generally offer a one-year limited warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials, a two-year limited warranty on certain systems (such as electrical or cooling systems), and a ten-year limited warranty on structural defects. In addition, we honor any outstanding warranties related to our acquired companies. Any covered item will be repaired or replaced to conform to approximately the original quality standards of the home at the time of closing. We also currently provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or Veterans Administration (“VA”) regulations. From time to time, we evaluate our warranty offerings, including third-party warranty coverage, taking into account market changes and regulatory requirements. 
Sales and Marketing 
We are committed to continuously enhancing our customer experience, including how we target and attract our consumers. Our marketing program calls for a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our corporate sales and marketing team provides a centralized marketing framework across our regional operations as well as operational sales strategy and training among our local teams. Our divisional marketing teams utilize corporate supplied messaging that is localized for relevance to our consumer groups in each market. Our advertising and digital media strategy is managed centrally but allows for division variance by size of division, cost of media, inventory count, number of community openings, seasonality, and a variety of other factors. 
Our goal is to identify the preferences of our customers and demographic groups and offer them innovative, well-designed homes that are efficient and profitable to build. We strive to maintain product and price level differentiation through continual market and customer research. We also use key indicators of market specific supply and demand characteristics to determine preferences of our customer base and to perform an optimal matching of consumer groups, product and community design, and specific location.
The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.taylormorrison.com (none of the information on or accessible through this website is a part of this Annual Report). In 2021, we continued to evolve our full suite of online tools to further enhance our online customer experience. While many of these new online products were already contemplated in our digital roadmap, the global pandemic and spread of COVID-19 accelerated our implementation in 2020. In 2021, experiential e-commerce became essential to all companies that are selling online. We enhanced our interactive, experiential and highly tailored pathways to buy a home completely online and we believe our customers are adapting well to this new way of home shopping. In 2021, we conducted two rounds of qualitative and quantitative consumer research with a third-party research firm to further refine our tools. These tools include 1) a state-of-the-art customized chatbot to help provide information, engage the shopper and capture the lead; 2) online appointments to help customers schedule an appointment with ease and speed; 3) self-guided tours to allow customers to tour our homes privately, safely and outside of normal business hours; and 4) online home reservations that allow shoppers to reserve a home online. In 2021, we debuted our Venture communities where shoppers seamlessly continue their online shopping experience by visiting one of our model homes via a self-guided, in-person tour. These tools have proved to be instrumental to our online/virtual sales success in 2021 and beyond. Customers may also use the website to make inquiries and to receive a prompt response from one of our “Internet Home Consultants.” This platform was centralized in recent years, providing coverage for all divisions seven days a week—improving our customers' experience and developing consistency across the country. The website is fully integrated with our customer relationship management ("CRM") and lead scoring system. By analyzing the content of the CRM, we are able to focus our lead generation programs to deliver high-quality sales leads. With these leads we are better able to increase sale conversion rates and lower marketing costs. We believe the digital marketing strategy for our websites, which is continually reviewed and refined, provides high return on our investments. The synergies and enhanced performance realized from our Internet Sales Program throughout 2021 have positioned us to move to the next phase of our online sales strategy integrating our suite of online sales tools and resources allowing us to offer our customers a complete online sales solution.
We selectively utilize traditional advertising such as print, directional marketing, newspapers, billboards and radio at the local level. We also directly notify local real estate agents and firms of new community openings in order to benefit from existing real estate agent/broker channels in each market. Pricing for our homes is evaluated weekly based on an analysis of market conditions, competitive environment and supply and demand characteristics.
We use furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate the advantages of the designs, features and functionality of our homes and to enhance visitor experience. Depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the product lines to be offered, we generally build between one and three model homes for each active selling community. In 2021, we launched a national model home program standard known as Portrait, aligned with a select group of design firms. These firms will implement our Taylor Morrison standards based on a defined blueprint implementing national programs, such as Canvas, into our model homes with defined costs, pricing, predictable delivery time frames, integrated marketing programs and a model store front that conveys the customer preferences we have identified. Our Canvas design package program was launched nationally 2021. This includes our curated design packages which are created based on consumer preference, take rate analytics and product procurement availability. This standardized approach not only allows us to create more predictable results, but also time synergies, cost benefits and support of our digital online sales strategy. Furthermore, the debut of our new Venture communities brings together our online tools along with our Portrait and Canvas programs providing a next-level digital home buying platform that offers the customer real-person guidance, when needed, and independence in the home shopping experience. Customers can experience our communities and model homes at their convenience without being physically accompanied by a sales person, with support through integrated technology throughout the model home experience. From a sales operations perspective, our focus on business simplification is paramount engaging data to refine our strategic selling 
strategy. Operational efficiencies have included standardized processes, disciplined strategic activities and also execution of national programs. 
Our homes are sold by our commissioned team members who work from sales offices generally located within our model homes. Our goal is to ensure our sales force has extensive knowledge of our homes, including our energy efficient features, sales strategies, mortgage options and community dynamics. To achieve this goal, we have on-going training for our sales team and conduct regular meetings to keep them abreast of the latest promotions, options and sales techniques and geographic competition. Our sales team members are licensed real estate agents where required by law and assist our customers in adding design features to their homes, which we believe appeal to local consumer preferences. Third-party brokers who sell our homes are generally paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. In some of our divisions, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with options and upgrades to personalize their homes. Utilizing these third-party design studios allows us to manage our overhead and costs more efficiently. We may also offer various sales incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades. The use, types and amount of incentives depends largely on existing economic and local competitive market conditions. The consumer demand for online sales tools and the evolution of the digital homebuying experiences has engaged synergies among our internal and external commission programs.
Competition
We operate in a very competitive environment with competition from a number of other homebuilders in each of our markets. We compete with large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders for land, financing and related services, raw materials, skilled management, volume discounts and local realtor and labor resources. We also compete with the resale, or “previously owned,” home market, as well as other housing alternatives such as the rental housing market. 
In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We may have a varying amount of homes under construction, home closings, revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter. Our results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include, but are not limited to:
•the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects;
•the timing of sales;
•the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels;
•the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction;
•the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate;
•mix of homes closed;
•construction timetables;
•the cost and availability of materials and labor; and
•weather conditions in the markets in which we build.
As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of a full fiscal year. To illustrate the seasonality in net homes sold, homes closed and home closings revenue, a summary of the quarterly financial data follows:


 | Three Months Ended,
 | 2021 | | | 2020
 | March 31 | | June 30 | | September 30 | December 31 | | March 31 | | June 30 | September 30 | | December 31
Net homes sold | 31 | % | | 24 | % | 23 | % | 22 | % | | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 29 | % | 25 | %
Home closings revenue | 19 | % | | 23 | % | 25 | % | 33 | % | | 22 | % | | 25 | % | 28 | % | 25 | %
Income before income taxes(1) | 15 | % | | 19 | % | 26 | % | 40 | % | | (9) | % | | 26 | % | 46 | % | 37 | %
Net income(1) | 15 | % | | 19 | % | 25 | % | 41 | % | | (12) | % | | 27 | % | 46 | % | 39 | %

(1)2020 includes the impacts of one-time costs relating to the acquisition of William Lyon Homes (“WLH”). The three months ended March 31, 2020 was materially impacted by such costs as the acquisition was completed during that quarter. 
Financial Services
TMHF provides a number of finance-related services to our customers through our mortgage lending operations. The strategic purpose of TMHF is:
•to utilize mortgage finance as a sales tool in the home sale process to ensure a consistent customer experience and assist in maintaining home production efficiency; and
•to control and analyze our sales order backlog quality and to manage projected home closing and delivery dates for our customers.
TMHF operates as an independent mortgage banker and conducts its business as a FHA Full Eagle lender. TMHF funds mortgage loans utilizing warehouse credit facilities. Revenue is earned through origination and processing fees combined with service release premiums earned in the secondary market once the loans are sold to investors. Typically, loans are sold and servicing is released within 15-20 business days.
TMHF competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. TMHF utilizes a multi-investor correspondent platform which gives us increased flexibility when placing loans to meet our customers’ needs.

Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Regulatory
We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as natural space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has increased our overall costs, and may delay 
the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices. In addition, local and state governments have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects under their jurisdictions, as well as requiring concessions or that the builder construct certain improvements to public places such as parks and streets or fund schools. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us.
TMHF is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators.
In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies.
Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state. Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents.
Environmental
We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, “environmental laws”). For example, environmental laws may affect: how we manage stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges, and dust; how we develop or operate on properties on or affecting resources such as wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, or areas subject to preservation laws; and how we address contamination. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental characteristics of the site and its present and former uses. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Noncompliance with environmental laws could result in fines and penalties, obligations to remediate, permit revocation, and other sanctions; and contamination or other environmental conditions at or in the vicinity of our developments could result in claims against us for personal injury, property damage, or other losses. 
We manage compliance with environmental laws at the division level with assistance from the corporate and regional legal departments. As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns.
In addition, we believe we have the responsibility of creating communities and neighborhoods which will have long-lasting, positive impacts on their environments and the people who live in them. As such, we are committed to integrating sustainable values into all aspects of our business. This commitment to sustainability, our communities and our team is highlighted in our latest Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report available on our website.
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites. We have a health and safety audit system that includes comprehensive twice-yearly independent third-party inspections of selected sites covering all aspects of health and safety. Key areas of focus are on site conditions meeting exacting health and safety standards, and on subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meeting or exceeding expectations. All of our team members must complete an assigned curriculum of online safety courses each year. These courses vary according to job responsibility. In addition, groups such as construction and field personnel are required to attend additional health and safety related training programs. As a result of the COVID-19 virus, we have taken additional health and safety precautions which are described below in Human Capital Resources.
Information Technology
We have a centralized information technology organization with its core team located at our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, augmented with field support technicians in key locations across the U.S. Our approach to information technology is to continuously simplify our information technology platform and consolidate and standardize applications. We believe a common application platform enables the sharing of ideas and rapid implementation of process improvements and best practices across the entire company. Our back-office operations use a fully integrated, industry recognized enterprise resource planning package. Marketing and field sales utilize a leading CRM solution that tracks leads and prospects from all sources and manages the customer communication process from lead creation through the buying process and beyond the post-warranty period. Field operations teams collaborate with our supply chain management to schedule and manage development and construction projects with a set of standard and widely used homebuilding industry solutions.
Intellectual Property
We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 3,000 full-time equivalent persons. Of these, approximately 2,500 were engaged in corporate and homebuilding operations, and the remaining approximately 500 were engaged in financial services. As of December 31, 2021, none of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are supervised by our project managers and field superintendents who manage third party subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for some architectural, engineering, advertising and legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
The people who work for our company are our most valuable resources and are critical to our continued success and execution of our strategies. Our People Services team focuses on attracting, promoting and retaining qualified employees with the expertise needed to manage and support our operations. Our top division and regional leaders average over seven years of tenure with us. In addition, our executive leadership who are responsible for setting our overall strategy average approximately 14 years with us, and many of them have worked their entire careers in the homebuilding industry. 
To attract and retain top talent in our industry, we offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and highly competitive compensation packages. Our employees are eligible for medical, dental and vision insurance, a savings/retirement plan, life and disability insurance, various wellness programs and tuition reimbursement, along with other optional benefits designed to meet individual needs. We engage third party compensation and benefits consulting firms to evaluate our programs and benchmark them against our peers. We believe it is essential to provide opportunities for growth and development to recruit top talent in the labor environment. We offer over 5,000 online courses through our learning system, as well as various leadership programs designed for those in different stages of their leadership journey.
We believe in recognizing and promoting future leaders from within our organization and making diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) an ongoing important priority. We provide courses which focus on adherence to company policies on DEI, and our leadership team hosts town hall meetings within the organization to ensure employees have a voice, awareness, and commitment to DEI. In addition, we have established subcommittees consisting of diverse team members who meet quarterly to help inform our National DEI Committee's agenda, as well as our overall DEI strategy. Our leadership team is committed to creating a collaborative and inclusive work environment and continues to develop initiatives, policies and procedures to foster greater DEI. At December 31, 2021, our workforce consisted of approximately 46% females and of these 19% were in managerial roles. The Company has and will continue to demonstrate that there is an open door and a path to leadership for all 
team members at any level of our company. Accordingly, we are proud to have been included for the fourth consecutive year as one of only 418 companies, and the only U.S. homebuilder, on the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), fostering greater transparency and an inclusive work environment in a traditionally male-dominated industry.
The safety of our employees, customers, and third party vendors is one of management’s top priorities. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our leadership team has utilized a COVID Task Force which continues to meet regularly to discuss, among other things, recent infection and related trends and the latest Center for Disease Control recommendations. The Task Force determines the appropriate protocols and procedures to maintain health and safety within the organization and with our customers and trade partners. We continue to review and adjust our protocols and procedures to ensure the safety of all parties as well as to ensure all of our locations are operating within applicable local, state, and national guidelines and mandates.
