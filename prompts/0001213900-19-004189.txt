Industry Overview
 
Supported by the Chinese government’s endorsement and driven by its focus on petroleum resource independence, and environmental protection, the electric vehicle sector is the most promising segment in the Chinese auto industry. China has become the largest new energy vehicle market in the world. According to a government forecast, China’s new energy vehicle sales are projected to grow to 2.1 million units in 2020, and its penetration is expected to reach 7% by 2020.
 
The rapid growth of the electric vehicle sector in China is supported by the Chinese government’s policies. The Chinese government endorses the long-term development of new-energy vehicles. The electric vehicle boom was initiated by government efforts including tax deductions and subsidies. China is the largest producer of and market for new-energy vehicles. China is a global leader in the new-energy vehicle sector.
 
Competitive Landscape
 
In general, our EV business faces competition from two groups of competitors: traditional vehicle manufacturers and new market entrants.
 
In terms of competition with conventional fuel vehicle manufacturers, many of our conventional fuel vehicle competitors are much larger in terms of size, manufacturing capabilities, customer bases, financial, marketing and human resources than Kandi. However, the conventional fuel automobiles face many challenges, including but not limited to environmental pollution and energy scarcity, which provide great opportunities for the rapid development of the EV industry in China. With the government’s strong support and various policy incentives, the electric vehicle industry in China has the potential for significant growth in the future. We believe our exclusive focus on pure electric vehicles products and parts are the basis on which we can compete in the Chinese automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition.
 
There are many companies in China that engage in the research, production and distribution of electric vehicles. Competition within the Chinese electric vehicle market is intense as we have to compete with many domestic and global, established and new EV manufacturers nationwide, some of whom have greater brand recognition and resources than we do. As one of the front runners in the Chinese electric vehicle industry, we believe our innovative business model, deep industry knowledge; technological innovation, competitive pricing, and service options allow us to develop the most suitable products and solutions for our targeted customers in our niche market. In particular, the Online Ride Sharing Service (“ORSS”) or the “Car-Share Program,” is an upgraded car share program of our Micro Public Transportation (the “MPT program”) that we advocated and tried for years, which had received praise by our customers and the Chinese government. We expect the ORSS program may help us gain additional market share and compete effectively against other EV manufacturers.

Our Opportunities and Growth Strategy
 
Local governments in China are pushing for new electric vehicle adoption with strong policy support, due to worsening air pollution and concerns about petroleum resource dependence. As one of the beneficiaries of the new energy vehicle industry take-off, Kandi has become one of the front runners in China’s electric vehicle industry, given its technology innovation with integrated solutions and operation experience.
 
Our business strategy includes efforts to provide customers with high-quality products, to expand our footprint in new and existing markets, and to advance our profile and the market demand through the further innovations in the Car- Share Program and the JV Company’s direct sales channel. We also provide EV products to end users through our distributors. We anticipate that our pure EV product business in China, through the operations of the JV Company and with the support of new Chinese policies (including the Double Credit System policy), will continue to develop and grow in the future.
 
Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking availability, and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered private cars. The best solution to solve these problems is to increase more affordable public transportation for urban residents. Subway and bus used to be the most popular public transportation options available. They form the main artery of urban public transportation but such system is lack of capillary. In this regard, we introduced the Car-Share Program by using pure electric vehicles. Urban public transportation system can be improved with the ORSS program.
 
In order to further improve the Car- Share Program, we united other operators in more than 10 cities to form of a five-year 300,000 units online ride-sharing service alliance at the beginning of 2019. As one of the most active practitioners of sharing economy model in China nowadays, this innovative business model provides a total solution to EV sharing. The character of this program is that all the cars casted to the online platform by the alliance use the changing-battery-model. The changing battery model solves the problems including high price of EVs, short recharging mileage, long recharging time, shortage of charging facilities, battery attenuation and potential pollution problem and so on. Furthermore this model allows the battery to be slowly recharged at a constant temperature, which prolongs the usage life of the battery and truly realize green energy efficiency. We have reason to believe that this upgrade to ORSS program from MPT advocated and practiced by Kandi will become the benchmark of urban car-share and play a significant role in the development of China’s urban travel ecosphere.
 
On July 1, 2018, we acquired 100% ownership of SC Autosports, LLC (“SC Autosports”). SC Autosports is a Dallas-based sales company primarily engaged in the wholesale of off-road vehicle products, with a small percentage of its business derived from off-road vehicle parts wholesale and retail. Currently, it has a seasoned management team and a distribution force averaging over ten years of sales experience. With nationwide sales channels in the U.S.
 
SC Autosports is going to commence the sales of the electric vehicles in 2019. On February 20, 2019, Kandi’s Model EX3 and Model K22, have received approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). The NHTSA approval is an assurance that Kandi’s two EV models conform to NHTSA standards and are registered in the U.S. Thus, SC Autosports is confident to launch these two models to American market.

Environmental and Safety Regulation
 
Emissions
 
Our products are all subject to international laws and emissions related standards and regulations, including regulations and related standards established by China Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and European and Canadian legislative bodies. 
 
According to the management’s knowledge, the Company’s products have been designed and developed according to the environmental regulations of the target market since the research and development period, and have passed the corresponding tests before the products are put into production and sales, and obtained the compulsory product certification of the corresponding countries and regions.
 
If the standards and rules we execute are modified, or interpreted differently, or the product certification certificate expires, we will evaluate the product and restart the corresponding product design improvement and product testing/certification procedures to continuously ensure the target market environment regulatory compliance. The Company cannot estimate the extent to which these changes, if any, will affect our operating costs in the future.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s subordinates, Kandi Electric Vehicles and SC Autosports, conducted a policy investigation and conformity assessment on environmental regulations and standards for the Kandi electric vehicles EX3 and K22 sold to the US market. The Company’s subsidiaries will develop and implement corresponding action plans based on the assessment results. The resources required to implement such an action plan will be an important part of the foreseeable cost of sales that constitutes the export of Kandi EVs to the United States.
 
However, once the US changes in environmental protection policies and regulations for automotive products, or changes in import tariff policies, or changes in US automobile product consumption tax policies, or changes in US new energy vehicle product subsidy policies, the Company cannot estimate the impact of these changes on the EV sales in the United States.
 
Product Safety and Regulation
 
Safety Regulation
 
The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi’s products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to off-road vehicles and regulates the safety of electric vehicles for road vehicles.
 
In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “Product Safety Act”) was passed. The Product Safety Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the American National Standards Institute/Specialty Vehicle Institute of America (“ANSI/SVIA”) safety standard, which previously had been voluntary. The Product Safety Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Both Kandi and SC Autosports currently comply with the ANSI/SVIA standard.

Kandi’s off-road vehicles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicles comply with safety standards applicable to off-road vehicles.
 
Kandi’s off-road vehicles are also subject to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally.
 
For the future sales of Kandi EX3\K22 electric vehicle to the US market, the Company’s R&D department collected and checked the relevant provisions adopted by NHTSA by the end of 2018. Through the conformity assessment and design improvement of product safety standards, the Kandi EX3 and K22 electric vehicles were approved by NHTSA and obtained the qualification for the import and registration of electric vehicles in the United States. Therefore, Kandi believes that the EX3\K22 electric vehicle can meet the US product safety regulations and standards.
