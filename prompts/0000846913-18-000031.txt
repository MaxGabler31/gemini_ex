AIR POLLUTION CONTROL
Regulations and Markets: Domestic
The continued growth of our APC technology segment is dependent upon the adoption and enforcement of environmental regulations in the U.S. and globally. In the U.S., federal and state laws regulating the emission of NOx are the primary driver in our APC technology segment. The principal regulatory drivers currently in effect are as follows:
Clean Air Act: The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) at levels that are protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety. The six pollutants specified include: Ozone (O3), Particulate Matter (PM), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Lead, and Carbon Monoxide (CO). The NAAQS provisions require that states comply with ozone and particulate emissions standards. NOx emissions are a precursor to ozone formation and also contribute to fine particulate emissions (PM2.5), which has been the recent regulatory driver through the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). NOx emissions were targeted as contributors to fine particulate emissions and ozone emissions. Since 1990, programs have been established by the EPA at the regional and federal level to help states in their mission to define and meet their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) for attainment. NAAQS PM standards were issued in 1997, with more stringent standards issued in 2006 and 2012. The NAAQS ozone standards issued in 1997 were made more stringent in 2008. On October 1, 2015, the EPA strengthened the NAAQS for ground-level ozone by reducing the minimum acceptable level from 75 to 70 parts per billion (ppb). Implementation of the 2015 NAAQS standards will begin in 2018 with finalization of the area designations.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR): On July 7, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency passed the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) under the “good neighbor” provision of the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx from power plants in the eastern half of the United States. This rule replaces the Clean Air Transport Rule (CATR) and focuses on reducing air emissions contributing to fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone nonattainment that often travel across state lines; including SO2 and NOx which contribute to PM2.5 transport. CSAPR affected 27 states, with compliance for the first phase in 2012, with additional reductions required in the second phase by 2014. Under CSAPR, state emission caps were designated to mitigate the emission impact on downwind states by controlling emissions from upwind states. If sources within a state caused the state to exceed its assurance limit, severe penalties including a two-for-one reduction based on each source’s contribution percentage of the state overage would be applied. The timing of CSAPR's implementation has been affected by a number of court actions. In December 2011, CSAPR was stayed prior to implementation due to lawsuits filed by various states and combustion sources, and in August 2012 the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, vacated CSAPR and remanded it to the EPA. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision in April 2014. Following the remand of the case to the D.C. Circuit, the EPA requested that the court lift the CSAPR stay and toll the CSAPR compliance deadlines by three years. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request and, accordingly, CSAPR Phase 1 implementation commenced in 2015, with Phase 2 implementation starting in 2018 for the May to September ozone season, one year later than originally planned. 
Industrial Boiler MACT: In December 2011, the EPA re-proposed its new emissions rule for industrial, commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters, known as the Industrial Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard. The EPA implemented the final rule on January 31, 2013, with compliance starting in January 2016 for most units. Emissions regulated include acid gas emissions including hydrochloric acid (HCl), carbon monoxide (CO), mercury, PM, and dioxins. Due to on-going litigation, final resolution has not been determined for all the boiler types and categories, although many sources have installed controls to meet the requirements.
Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR): The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), also known as the Regional Haze rule, is part of the Clean Air Act and was finalized in 2005. Under CAVR, certain States are required to submit implementation plans to the EPA to comply with the Regional Haze requirements, and updates are required every five years. A new CAVR was issued in January 2017 which requires states to implement new air pollution controls by 2021. The overall obligation of CAVR is to return the US scenic areas to “active” visibility by 2064.
Consent Decrees: Consent decree activity through the US Department of Justice or EPA may require emission sources to meet individual requirements. Sources may also agree to specific air pollution requirements with states or environmental groups.

Regulations and Markets: International
We also sell NOx control systems outside the United States, specifically in Europe, Latin America, India (under a license agreement) and in the Pacific Rim, including the People’s Republic of China (China). The European Union published the BREF (Best Available Reference Technology) emission guidelines in mid 2017 that further lower emission targets over a span of the next four years. The implementation of the ultra-low emission rules in China is close to completion on large utility boilers but the focus is now shifting to the industrial sector. The Indian government’s initial compliance deadline of December 2017 has been delayed but adoption of emission control technologies has started and it is expected to progress at a faster pace in 2018. We expect these developments to further present opportunities to implement our technologies in the international markets.
China continues to represent an attractive opportunity for us as the government continues its policy of pollution control, energy conservation and efficiency improvements as top priorities, as part of tightened standards addressed by the super clean emission regulation officially released in December, 2015. However, the focus is starting to shift to the industrial sector. China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection issued super clean emission regulations to be fully implemented by 2020, in support of reducing harmful pollutants and further defining the technologies recommended to achieve the reductions. Super clean emission requires NOx emission under 50 mg/Nm3, SO2 emission under 35 mg/Nm3 and particulate emission under 10 mg/Nm3. The regulations apply to all public utility units of 300MW or larger and private power generation units of 100MW or larger, and were planned to be progressively implemented in the eastern region by 2017, the central region by 2018, and the western region by 2020. The pace of implementation has been faster than anticipated and is expected to be completed in 2018 with few projects remaining for 2019. These emission limits are now being more diligently enforced on industrial emitters. This prompts a shift for suppliers of emission control technologies to become more active in the industrial market space. We anticipate that Fuel Tech’s technologies will be in demand in this sector, particularly with clients in critical process industries such as petro-chemical, who value high performance over low cost.
In Europe, new standards on emissions will lower the environmental impact of more than 3000 large combustion plants throughout the European Union. Moreover, European countries not current EU members are expected to adopt these new standards as part of their approach to gain EU membership. In August 2017, the Large Combusion Plant (LCP) BREF was published with new emission limits being phased in over the next four years for multiple pollutants including NOx and particulate matter. In addition, for the first time, limits for Mercury and Hydrogen Chloride have been established for the EU. Despite the significant expansion of renewable energy throughout Europe, the EU and neighboring states still rely heavily on coal generation to provide a stable base load to their power and heating demands. The BREF guidelines reduce NOx limit values by up to 25% which will require an upgrade of first generation NOx abatement systems, and that is expected to present new opportunities for Fuel Tech. However, the pace of implementation will still be dependent on each country’s internal processes. 
In India, stricter emission targets were announced by the government in December 2015 and phased implementation has begun. Several companies are actively doing engineering studies and preparing technical specifications for their clients to enable them to implement control technologies for NOx and particulate matter in the next couple of years. Trials of SCR and SNCR technologies by NTPC are expected to begin in Q1, 2018. The results are expected to speed up the adoption of these technologies by both government owned plants and IPPs, which is expected to result in a higher demand of Fuel Tech's SNCR and flue gas conditioning technologies, implemented through our collaboration with our local partner ISGEC.
Products
Our NOx reduction and particulate control technologies are installed worldwide on over 1000 combustion units, including utility, industrial and municipal solid waste applications. Our products include customized NOx control systems and our patented ULTRA®technology, which converts urea-to-ammonia on site and provides safe reagent for use in Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems.

• | SNCR Systems: Our NOxOUT® and HERT™ SNCR processes use non-hazardous urea as the reagent rather than ammonia. Both the NOxOUT® and HERT™ processes on their own are capable of reducing NOx by up to 25% - 50% for utilities and by potentially significantly greater amounts for industrial units in many types of plants with capital costs ranging from $5 - $20/kW for utility boilers and with total annualized operating costs ranging from $1,000 - $2,000/ton of NOx removed. 


• | I-NOx® Systems: Our I-NOx® systems can include LNB, OFA, and SNCR components, along with SCR technology, Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG), and Graduated Straightening Grid (GSG™) system. Together, these systems provide up to 90% NOx reduction at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional SCR systems while providing greater operational flexibility to plant operators. The capital costs for I-NOx® systems can range from $30 - $150/kW depending on boiler size and configuration, which is significantly less than that of conventional SCRs, which can cost $300/kW or more, while operating costs are competitive with those experienced by SCR systems. Our SCR systems utilize urea or ammonia as the SCR catalyst reagent to achieve NOx reductions of up to 85% from industrial combustion sources.

• | ULTRA Technology: Our ULTRA® process is designed to convert urea to ammonia safely and economically for use as a reagent in the SCR process for NOx reduction. Recent local objections in the ammonia permitting process have raised concerns regarding the safety of ammonia shipment and storage in quantities sufficient to supply SCR. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has characterized anhydrous ammonia as a Toxic Inhalation Hazard commodity. Our ULTRA® process is believed to be a market leader for the safe conversion of urea to ammonia just prior to injection into the flue gas duct, which is particularly important near densely populated cities, major waterways, harbors or islands, or where the transport of anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is a safety concern. Ammonia feed systems provide reagent flexibility for SCR reagent feed system, while our UDI™ Urea Direct Injection systems utilize direct injection of reagent without the need for an ammonia injection grid. 


• | SCR Processes and Services: Our SCR group provides process design optimization, performance testing and improvement, and catalyst selection services for SCR systems on coal-fired boilers. In addition, other related services, including start-ups, maintenance support and general consulting services for SCR systems, Ammonia Injection Grid design and tuning to help optimize catalyst performance, and catalyst management services to help optimize catalyst life, are now offered to customers around the world. We also specialize in computational fluid dynamics models, which simulate fluid flow by generating a virtual replication of real-world geometry and operating inputs. We design flow corrective devices, such as turning vanes, ash screens, static mixers and our patented GSG® Graduated Straightening Grid. Our models help clients optimize performance in flow critical equipment, such as selective catalytic reactors in SCR systems, where the effectiveness and longevity of catalysts are of utmost concern. The Company’s modeling capabilities are also applied to other power plant systems where proper flow distribution and mixing are important for performance, such as flue gas desulfurization scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, air heaters, exhaust stacks and carbon injection systems for mercury removal. 


• | ESP Processes and Services: ESP technologies for particulate control include Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) products and services including ESP Inspection Services, Performance Modeling, and Performance and Efficiency Upgrades, along with complete turnkey capability for ESP retrofits. Flue gas conditioning (FGC) systems include treatment using sulfur trioxide (SO3) and ammonia (NH3) based systems to improve the performance of ESPs by modifying the properties of the fly ash particle. Our ULTRA technology can provide the ammonia system feed requirements for FGC applications as a safe alternative to ammonia reagent based systems. FGC systems offer a lower capital cost approach to improving ash particulate capture versus the alternative of installing larger ESPs or utilizing fabric filter technology to meet targeted emissions and opacity limits. Fuel Tech’s particulate control technologies have been installed on more than 125 units worldwide. 


• | Burner Systems: Low NOx Burners and Ultra Low NOx Burners (LNB and ULNB) are available for coal-, oil-, and gas-fired industrial and utility units. Each system application is specifically designed to maximize NOx reduction. Computational fluid dynamics combustion modeling is used to validate the design prior to fabrication of equipment. NOx reductions can range from 40%-60% depending on the fuel type. Over-Fire Air (OFA) systems stage combustion for enhanced NOx reduction. Additional NOx reductions, beyond Low NOx Burners, of 35% - 50% are possible on different boiler configurations on a range of fuel types. Combined overall reductions range from 50% - 70%, with overall capital costs ranging from $10 - $20/kW and total costs ranging from $300 - $1,500/ton of NOx removed, depending on the scope. 

The key market dynamic for the APC product line is the continued use of coal as the principal fuel source for global electricity production. Coal currently accounts for approximately 30% of all U.S. electricity generation and roughly 69% of Chinese electricity generation. Major coal consumers include China, the United States and India. The growth of natural gas in the U.S. for industrial applications has increased the need for SCR technology since it often meets the definition of Best Available Control Technology and is required on new industrial units.
Sales of APC products were $27.8 million, $34.1 million, and $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
NOx Reduction Competition
Competition with our NOx reduction suite of products may be expected from companies supplying urea SNCR systems, combustion modification products, SCR systems and ammonia SNCR systems. In addition, we experience competition in the urea-to-ammonia conversion market.

Combustion modifications, including Low NOx Burners and Over-Fire Air systems, can be fitted to most types of boilers with cost and effectiveness varying with specific boilers. Combustion modifications may yield up to 20% - 60% NOx reduction economically with capital costs ranging from $10 - $20/kW and total costs ranging from $300 - $1,500/ton of NOx removed. The modifications are designed to reduce the formation of NOx and are typically the first NOx reduction efforts employed. Companies such as GE, and Babcock & Wilcox Company, are active competitors in the Low NOx Burner business. Once NOx is formed, then the SCR process is an effective and proven method of control for removal of NOx up to 90%. SCR systems have a high capital cost of $300+/kW on retrofit coal applications. Such companies as GE, Babcock Power, Babcock & Wilcox Company, CECO Environmental and Mitsubishi Hitachi, are active SCR system and reagent feed system providers. 
The use of ammonia as the reagent for the SNCR process can reduce NOx by 30% - 70% on incinerators but has limited applicability in the utility industry. Ammonia system capital costs range from $5 - $20/kW, with annualized operating costs ranging from $1,000 - $3,000/ton of NOx removed. These systems require the use of either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia, both of which are hazardous substances.
In addition to or in lieu of using the foregoing processes, certain customers may elect to close or de-rate plants, purchase electricity from third-party sources, switch from higher to lower NOx-emitting fuels or purchase NOx emission allowances.
Lastly, with respect to urea-to-ammonia conversion technologies, a competitive approach to our controlled urea decomposition system competes with Wahlco, Inc., which manufactures a system that hydrolyzes urea under high temperature and pressure.
APC Backlog
Consolidated APC segment backlog at December 31, 2017 was $22.1 million versus backlog at December 31, 2016 of $8.0 million. A substantial portion of the backlog as of December 31, 2017 should be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2018, although the timing of such revenue recognition in 2018 is subject to the timing of the expenses incurred on existing projects.
FUEL CHEM
Product and Markets
The FUEL CHEM® technology segment revolves around the unique application of specialty chemicals to improve the efficiency, reliability and environmental status of plants operating in the electric utility, industrial, pulp and paper, waste-to-energy, and university and district heating markets. FUEL CHEM programs are currently in place on combustion units in North America, Mexico and Europe, treating a wide variety of solid and liquid fuels, including coal, heavy oil, black liquor, biomass and municipal waste.
Central to the FUEL CHEM approach is the introduction of chemical reagents, such as magnesium hydroxide, to combustion units via in-body fuel application (pre-combustion) or via direct injection (post-combustion) utilizing our proprietary TIFI® technology. By attacking performance-hindering problems, such as slagging, fouling and corrosion, as well as the formation of sulfur trioxide (SO3), and ammonium bisulfate (ABS), our programs offer numerous operational, financial and environmental benefits to owners of boilers, furnaces and other combustion units. 
The key market dynamic for this product line is the continued use of coal as the principal fuel source for global electricity production. Coal currently accounts for approximately 30% of all U.S. electricity generation and roughly 69% of Chinese electricity generation. Major coal consumers include the United States, China and India. Additional market dynamics include a growing, worldwide utilization of biomass for both steam and electrical production, as well as the strengthening of the pulp and paper industry worldwide, resulting in black liquor recovery boilers needing to maximize throughput. 
The principal markets for this product line are electric power plants burning coals with slag-forming constituents such as sodium, iron and high levels of sulfur. Sodium is typically found in the Powder River Basin coals of Wyoming and Montana. Iron is typically found in coals produced in the Illinois Basin region. High sulfur content is typical of Illinois Basin coals and certain Appalachian coals. High sulfur content can give rise to unacceptable levels of SO3 formation especially in plants with SCR systems and flue gas desulphurization units (scrubbers).
The combination of slagging coals and SO3-related issues, such as “blue plume” formation, air pre-heater fouling and corrosion, SCR fouling and the proclivity to suppress certain mercury removal processes, represents an attractive market potential for Fuel Tech.
Sales of the FUEL CHEM products were $17.4 million, $21.1 million, and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
