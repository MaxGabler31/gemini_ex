During fiscal 2022, we introduced several new offerings, including: Prisma Cloud 3.0, Prisma Access 3.0, AIOps for NGFW, PAN-OS 10.2, and Cloud NGFW for AWS. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that fit well within our long-term strategy.
We plan to continue to significantly invest in our research and development efforts as we evolve and extend the capabilities of our portfolio.
Intellectual Property
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise security industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. We continue to grow our patent portfolio and own intellectual property and related intellectual property rights around the world that relate to our products, services, research and development, and other activities, and our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products.
We actively seek to protect our global intellectual property rights and to deter unauthorized use of our intellectual property by controlling access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, our rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our offerings are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. See “Risk Factors-Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business,” “Risk Factors-Our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us,” and “Legal Proceedings” below for additional information.
Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, impact our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.
Competition
We operate in the intensely competitive enterprise security industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the application, threat, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements for the protection from threats and the safe enablement of applications. Our main competitors fall into five categories:
•large companies that incorporate security features in their products, such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), or those that have acquired, or may acquire, large network and endpoint security vendors and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market;
•independent security vendors, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”), and Zscaler, Inc. (“Zscaler”), that offer a mix of network and endpoint security products;
•startups and single-vertical vendors that offer independent or emerging solutions across various areas of security;
•public cloud vendors and startups that offer solutions for cloud security (private, public and hybrid cloud); and
•large and small companies, such as Crowdstrike, Inc. (“Crowdstrike”), that offer solutions for security operations and endpoint security.

As our market grows, it will attract more highly specialized vendors, as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product features, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
•product line breadth, diversity, and applicability;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our portfolio, the ease of integration of our products with technological infrastructures, and the relatively low total cost of ownership of our products. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, more diversified product lines, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Sales, Marketing, Services and Support
Customers. Our end-customers are predominantly medium to large enterprises, service providers, and government entities. Our end-customers operate in a variety of industries, including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications. Our end-customers deploy our portfolio of products for a variety of security functions across a variety of deployment scenarios. Typical deployment scenarios include the enterprise perimeter, the enterprise data center, and the distributed enterprise perimeter. Our end-customer deployments typically involve at least one pair of our products along with one or more of our subscriptions, depending on size, security needs and requirements, and network complexity. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Distribution. We primarily sell our products and subscription and support offerings to end-customers through our channel partners utilizing a two-tier, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and subscription and support offerings to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers. Sales are generally subject to our standard, non-exclusive distributor agreement, which provides for an initial term of one year, one-year renewal terms, termination by us with 30 to 90 days written notice prior to the renewal date, and payment to us from the channel partner within 30 to 45 calendar days of the date we issue an invoice for such sales. For fiscal 2022, 53.6% of our total revenue was derived from sales to three distributors.
We also sell our VM-Series virtual firewalls directly to end-customers through Amazon’s AWS Marketplace, Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace, and Google’s Cloud Platform Marketplace under a usage-based licensing model.
Sales. Our sales organization is responsible for large-account acquisition and overall market development, which includes the management of the relationships with our channel partners, working with our channel partners in winning and supporting end-customers through a direct-touch approach, and acting as the liaison between our end-customers and our marketing and product development organizations. We expect to continue to grow our sales headcount to expand our reach in all key growth sectors.
Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with responsibility for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our end-customers, and technical training for our channel partners.
Channel Program. Our NextWave Channel Partner program is focused on building in-depth relationships with solutions-oriented distributors and resellers that have strong security expertise. The program rewards these partners based on a number of attainment goals, as well as provides them access to marketing funds, technical and sales training, and support. To promote optimal productivity, we operate a formal accreditation program for our channel partners’ sales and technical professionals. As of July 31, 2022, we had more than 6,700 channel partners.
Global Customer Success. Our Global Customer Success (“GCS”) organization is responsible for delivering professional, educational and support services directly to our channel partners and to end-customers. We leverage the capabilities of our channel partners and train them in the delivery of professional, educational and support services to enable these services to be locally delivered. We believe that a broad range of support services is essential to the successful customer deployment and ongoing support of our products, and we have hired support engineers with proven experience to provide those services.

Marketing. Our marketing is focused on building our brand reputation and the market awareness of our portfolio and driving pipeline and end-customer demand. Our marketing team consists primarily of product marketing, brand, demand generation, field marketing, digital marketing, communications, analyst relations and marketing analytics functions. Marketing activities include pipeline development through demand generation, social media and advertising programs, managing the corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, analyst relationships, customer advocacy, and customer awareness. Every year we organize multiple signature events, such as our end-customer conference “Ignite” and focused conferences such as “Cortex Symphony” and “SASE Converge.” We also publish threat intelligence research such as the Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report and the Unit 42 IoT Threat Report, which are based on data from our global threat intelligence team, Unit 42. These activities and tools benefit both our direct and indirect channels and are available at no cost to our channel partners.
Backlog. Orders for subscription and support offerings for multiple years are generally billed upfront upon fulfillment and are included in deferred revenue. Contract amounts that are not recorded in deferred revenue or revenue are considered backlog. We expect backlog related to subscription and support offerings will change from period to period for various reasons, including the timing and duration of customer orders and varying billing cycles of those orders. Products are billed upon shipment. The majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. However, insufficient supply and inventory may delay our hardware product shipments. As such, we do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is necessarily indicative of our future operating results.
Seasonality. Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns. We have begun to see seasonal patterns in our business, which we expect to become more pronounced as we continue to grow, with our strongest sequential revenue growth generally occurring in our fiscal second and fourth quarters.
Manufacturing
We outsource the manufacturing of our products to various manufacturing partners, which include our electronics manufacturing services provider (“EMS provider”) and original design manufacturers. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. Our EMS provider is Flextronics International, Ltd. (“Flex”), who assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
The component parts within our products are either sourced by our manufacturing partners or by us from various component suppliers. Our manufacturing and supply contracts, generally, do not guarantee a certain level of supply or fixed pricing, which increases our exposure to supply shortages or price increases.
Human Capital
We believe our ongoing success depends on our employees. Development and investment in our people is central to who we are, and will continue to be so. With a global workforce of 12,561 as of July 31, 2022, we take our People Strategy and FLEXWORK philosophy seriously and care for our employees. This is a critical element of our overall company strategy. Our People Strategy is a comprehensive approach to source, hire, onboard, integrate, develop, engage and reward employees. 
FLEXWORK. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, we have learned how to collaborate in a distributed hybrid work reality and to create opportunities for employees to maintain a sense of belonging and focus on well-being. In the future, we aim to continue to disrupt the nature of work. Our philosophy is simple: place our employees at the center of their working life by providing employees flexibility, personalization, and choice regarding how they work, the benefits they choose, the way they consume learning and, where possible, where and when they work. We believe that the more our employees have choice and demonstrate mutual trust and respect, the more engaged they will be. 
FLEXWORK adds even more opportunity to scale our efforts to improve Inclusion and Diversity (“I&D”). It further enables us to recognize each individual as unique, with their own priorities and needs, and gives the employee greater agency to personalize their decisions and utilize our programs and initiatives to meet those interests and desires. 
Source & Hire. Sourcing and hiring diverse talent and enabling them to create and execute is central to our comprehensive approach to talent acquisition, which we refer to as “The Way We Hire.” Our talent acquisition team utilizes a number of methods to find subject experts in their respective fields, including the use of a variety of channels that focus on reaching underrepresented talents. Our university relations team partners with hundreds of academic institutions, including colleges and universities that focus on serving diverse populations, to provide career pathways for early-in-career candidates. We also encourage current employees to provide qualified referrals, and to utilize our internal mobility program to grow their careers. We equip hiring managers with training so that they are made aware of potential unconscious biases and interview for the values and competencies that we believe enhance our culture. We have diverse interview panels to deliver a quality interview experience to a diverse slate of candidates.

Onboard & Integrate. We believe that a positive onboarding experience is foundational to our employees thriving and therefore to rapid productivity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we built and utilized virtual learning platforms and employee communication channels to provide new employees with inspirational, often personalized, onboarding experiences. Onboarding is a journey of integration that extends through the first year at Palo Alto Networks for every employee. In addition, we have built specialist learning tracks for interns and new graduates that have been recognized as best in class externally. As part of our merger and acquisition strategy, we have also established a robust integration program with the goal to enable individuals joining our teams to feel part of our culture at speed.
Develop & Motivate. FLEXLearn is our unique approach to personalized employee development. FLEXLearn is a learning experience platform that provides employees with a path based on their needs, interests, style, and career journey. Through FLEXLearn, employees have full agency to direct their growth at their pace and choosing. Development information about core business elements, professional skill sets, working in a distributed hybrid environment, as well as required company-wide compliance training, such as Code of Conduct, privacy and security, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, and anti-bribery training, is also deployed through the FLEXLearn platform for all employees. In addition, FLEXLearn provides employees with events and activities that motivate and spark critical thinking, on topics ranging from inclusion, to well-being and collaboration. On average, employees had completed 16 hours of development through the FLEXLearn platform during fiscal 2022.
Engage & Reward. We conduct regular executive listening sessions and “pulse surveys” to better understand employee engagement, sentiment, well-being, and the ability to transition to a distributed work model. Many of these sessions have informed our holistic People Strategy, our FLEXWORK philosophy, I&D strategies, and Internal Mobility program. 
Employee sentiment has continued to be highly positive. We continue to use insights from an anonymous global employee engagement survey we conducted in 2021 to execute action plans that reinforce our culture of engagement. Our internal pulse surveys and other feedback mechanisms, including insights from external employee sentiment sources and employer brand recognition, indicate that employees have a strong sense of belonging, confidence in leadership, and an understanding of how their work contributes to the Company’s goals.
In addition to a comprehensive compensation and diverse benefits program, we believe in an always-on feedback and rewards philosophy. From recurring 1:1 sessions and quarterly performance feedback to use of our Cheers for Peers peer recognition program, employees get continuous input about the value they bring to the organization.
Inclusion & Diversity. We are intentional about including diverse points of view, perspectives, experiences, backgrounds and ideas in our decision-making processes. We deeply believe that true diversity exists when we have representation of all ethnicities, genders, orientations and identities, and cultures in our workforce. Our I&D programs continue to advance those visions. The diversity of our board of directors, with women representing 33% of our board as of July 31, 2022, is an example of that vision in action. We have nine employee network groups (“ENG”s) which are employee-led groups that play a vital role in building understanding and awareness. Over 26% of our global workforce was involved in at least one ENG as of July 31, 2022. Our ENGs are provided with a budget to fund activities for their communities and to make charitable grants to organizations advancing their causes. We involve our ENGs in listening sessions with executive teams and we work in partnership to develop our annual I&D plans, because we believe involvement is critical. Our I&D philosophy is fully embedded in our talent acquisition, learning and development and rewards and recognition programs.
Environmental, Social & Governance
We recognize our duty to address environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. From our Climate Commitment and our social impact programs to our Supplier Responsibility initiatives and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we value the opportunity to have meaningful outcomes that reinforce our intention to respect our planet, uplift our communities and advance our industry.
Environmental. We recognize climate change is a global crisis and are committed to doing our part to reduce environmental impacts. Aligned to the Climate Commitments we declared in February 2021, we remain committed to utilizing 100% renewable energy, reducing our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and working across our value chain, and with coalitions, to achieve these goals by 2030. During fiscal 2022, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of our global environmental footprint and developed Science Based Targets aligned to a warming scenario of 1.5° Celsius. We joined The Climate Pledge during fiscal 2022 demonstrating our eagerness to engage in coalitions to advocate for climate action. We are committed to being transparent about our progress over time through annual reporting.

Social. In addition to our FLEXWORK People Strategy described in the section titled “Human Capital” above, we prioritized the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the deployment of our Global Supplier Code of Conduct, we continued to reach across our supply chain to communicate our expectations regarding labor standards, business practices and workplace health and safety conditions. During fiscal 2022, we maintained our affiliate membership in the Responsible Business Alliance and maintained our commitment to Supplier Diversity. We value our role as a good corporate citizen and in fiscal 2022 continued to execute our social impact programs. In addition to ongoing efforts to help colleagues and communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic , we invested in education programs, scholarships, diversity and basic needs. We expanded our work to provide cybersecurity curriculum to schools, universities and nonprofit organizations to help youth protect their digital way of life and to prepare diverse adults for careers in cybersecurity. Employees continued to participate in our giving, matching and volunteer programs to make impacts in their local communities.
Governance. Integrity is one of our core values. Our corporate behavior and leadership practices model ethical decision making. Employees and suppliers are informed about our governance expectations through our Codes of Conduct, compliance training programs and ongoing communications. Our board of directors is governed by Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are amended from time to time to incorporate best practices in corporate governance. Reinforcing the importance of our ESG performance, the charter of the ESG and Nominating Committee of the board of directors includes the primary oversight of ESG.
