The Hollister and Abercrombie customer relationship management programs provide a platform with which the Company can develop direct relationships with its customers and harness insights.

The stores are tailored to reflect the personality of each brand, with unique furniture, fixtures, music and scent adding to a rich brand experience, that is focused on the customer.

In Fiscal 2017, the Abercrombie and abercrombie kids brands launched new store prototypes which are both open and inviting, and have accommodating features such as innovative fitting rooms and omni-channel capabilities. Through the enhanced store environment, the Company has seen improved store engagement and greater overall productivity on a smaller footprint.

Both home office and field employees participate in monitoring suppliers’ compliance with the Company’s product quality standards. Before production begins, all factories, including subcontractors of the factories, undergo a quality assurance assessment to ensure they meet Company standards. All factories are contractually required to adhere to the Company’s Vendor Code of Conduct, go through social audits, which include on-site walk-throughs to appraise the physical working conditions and health and safety practices, and review payroll and age documentation. Social audits of the factories are performed at least every two years after the initial audit.
