How We Operate
We strive to provide superior return for our shareholders, exceptional value for our customers, great professional opportunities for our employees, and to be responsible to our communities through deployment of the HOM. The HOM is a consistent and repeatable framework designed to produce sustainable and predictable results.  The HOM describes our mission, vision, values and mindset as leaders; applies our management practices in Strategy Management, Segmentation, Lean, Talent Development, and Acquisitions; and prescribes three steps (Understand, Focus, and Grow) designed to make our businesses both bigger and better.  Our goal is to continue developing Hillenbrand as a world-class global industrial company through the deployment of the HOM.
Our strategy is to leverage our historically strong financial foundation and the implementation of the HOM to deliver sustainable profit growth, revenue expansion and substantial free cash flow, and then reinvest available cash in new growth initiatives focused on building platforms with leadership positions in our core markets and near adjacencies, both organically and inorganically, in order to create shareholder value. 
In fiscal 2021, we began integrating sustainability with the HOM. We believe sustainability to be a source of value creation that must be aligned with the core strategy of the Company. We expect to continue developing this part of our strategy as we grow in our sustainability practice. Among other things, we believe climate change will require meaningful action on a global scale, and we expect that further developing our understanding of our energy consumption and emissions will be an important part of examining the challenges posed by climate change. To date, our costs relating to addressing climate change have not been material.
Human Capital Resources
Purpose and Core Values
Our employees shape Hillenbrand’s success. They are the designers, engineers, manufacturers, makers, and shapers that bring our leading products and brands to life. Collectively, Hillenbrand plays a unique part in the development of a sustainable future, providing solutions to a wide variety of customers who manufacture what the world needs to thrive today, and partnering with them to develop new solutions for the needs of the future. 
Our Purpose, Shape What Matters for Tomorrow™, reflects our unique position as industry leaders, creating innovative solutions and end products that impact how people live, work, play, travel, eat, and heal. 
Our employees play a vital role in bringing our Purpose to life and are the life blood of a culture centered around our key unified Core Values: Win As One, Partner With Possibility, Make It Matter, and Drive to Deliver. Living these values empowers us to better serve one another, our communities, and our customers while we continue to pursue exceptional performance and long-term shareholder value. 
Workplace Demographics
Hillenbrand is committed to the growth of our employees by developing talent and building a growth-minded culture. We believe our employees give us the strength and skills to compete, and we must in turn help our employees reach their potential. We continue to use our talent cycle process and supporting tools to guide our employee experience. The COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity to adapt our practices to match new expectations from current and future employees and meet the evolving dynamics of our business.
At September 30, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 3,800 employees were located within the United States (“U.S.”) and 7,200 employees were located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and Asia. Approximately 66% of our workforce within the U.S. is composed of manufacturing direct labor, and the remaining population includes all other selling, general, and administrative professional employees.
Approximately 3,200 employees globally work under collective bargaining agreements and works councils. Hillenbrand strives to maintain satisfactory relationships with all its employees, including the unions and works councils representing those employees. As a result, we have not experienced a significant work stoppage due to labor relations in more than 20 years.
Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our Core Values and operating philosophy. In 2022, with both our people and our Core Values in mind, we expanded our focus to driving standardization of health and safety measures across our operations. Our Health & Safety Council (“Council”), which is composed of Environment, Health & Safety representatives from across the enterprise, leads our safety strategy and provides a forum for collaboration and data collection. The Council captures historic and ongoing safety data from our facilities, which is incorporated into our annual Sustainability Report. We have made a variety of safety improvements, including implementing a Global Health & Safety Policy which standardizes and implements enterprise-wide health and safety procedures and reinforces Hillenbrand’s commitment to providing a safe work environment. We track safety Company-wide, and all our sites, excluding our recent acquisitions Gabler, Herbold, and Linxis, report on Recordable Incident Rates.
Our operating companies manufactured products deemed essential during the COVID-19 pandemic, including those in health and safety, food and agriculture, as well as in the energy sector. We successfully continued operations during the pandemic through investments in creating a physically safe and healthy work environment for our employees.
Talent
Talent is one of the pillars of the HOM, and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our products and our customers, while encouraging new employees to bring new ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our relatively long average employee tenure across the globe — 10 years as of the end of the fiscal year 2022 — reflects the high engagement and dedication of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented employees, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. 
Once employees are hired, development plans are created and monitored for critical roles to ensure progress is made along established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, helping us increase our commitment to serve the needs of the local communities in which we operate, while simultaneously providing leadership development opportunities for our employees. Effectively managing employee performance and linking pay to performance management is a critical part to our approach. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We are committed to strengthening our culture through formalizing our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) efforts. As part of that commitment, we officially launched our DEI Roadmap in 2021, which includes a clear focus on actions to attract and retain diverse talent. Our DEI initiatives support our goal that everyone throughout the Company is engaged in creating an inclusive workplace, and we continue to work on increasing workforce diversity. Specifically, our Compensation Committee has added the creation and execution of DEI business plans to our executive management team’s collective performance goal relating to diverse talent pools. The Company’s commitment to diversity is also embodied by our Board of Directors, as our Corporate Governance Standards specify that members of the Board will be diverse in terms of gender and of race and ethnicity, as well as other characteristics, including background, perspective, knowledge, skills and experience. 
We believe that DEI is a journey that evolves with additional learning, transparency, data, and cultural adoption. In 2022, we continued this journey through the following: 
•In an open letter to global stakeholders, Hillenbrand President and CEO Kim Ryan publicly expressed her commitment to embedding DEI in our internal operations, in our external business activities, and among our many partners and stakeholders. This commitment included the formation of a DEI Executive Steering Committee, an Inclusion at Hillenbrand Council, and the formation of Business Resource Groups (BRGs).
•Developed a global DEI policy that reinforces our mission to embed DEI in our way of doing business and that outlines our expectations for leaders and all employees to uphold as part of our organization. The policy also provides information about how we govern and report DEI progress to our internal and external stakeholders. 
•Established our first five BRGs, which are led by employee volunteers and are important resources to foster cross-company connections, encourage belonging and champion employee voices.
•Strengthened internal measurement and external reporting, such as participating in Bloomberg Gender Equality Index.
•Drove leadership accountability by incorporating our new Core Values into our performance management process, reflecting inclusion as a key behavior and expectation of our senior leaders. 
•Established a Supplier Diversity Policy to embed the practice of soliciting and including qualified diverse suppliers in strategic sourcing opportunities.
Total Rewards
Hillenbrand offers benefits focused on supporting employees and their families as they navigate work and life. Hillenbrand’s compensation programs are designed to ensure employees are effectively compensated in terms of base salary, incentive compensation, and other benefits that support the health and wellness of our employees. Our compensation programs aim to attract and retain superior talent with pay for performance. We strive to pay within pay ranges developed based on market data and internal pay equity. We focus many benefit programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including onsite wellness centers, mental health support, telemedicine, and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.
Hillenbrand recognizes the importance of preparing for retirement. Employees are encouraged to participate in their own retirement savings where available. In the U.S., employees are eligible to participate in one of two 401(k) savings plans. Features of the plans vary, but may include automatic Company contributions, Company matching contributions on associate contributions, and automatic enrollment. These plans provide a wide range of investment choices along with tax-deferred investment growth. We no longer provide new pension benefits for U.S. employees, but continue pensions in other jurisdictions, where required by law.
Outside of the U.S., Hillenbrand provides an array of benefits to support employees and their families. These include benefits such as paid leaves of absence, medical insurance, disability coverage and life insurance, among others. 
Hillenbrand is committed to attracting, developing, engaging and retaining the best people from around the world to make our businesses run and grow. In everything we do, we strive to provide great professional opportunities for our people and recognize the critical role our human capital plays in supporting our strategy.
Cybersecurity
Our approach to cybersecurity begins with our responsibility for strong governance and controls. Security begins at the top of our organization, where Company leadership consistently communicates the requirements for vigilance and compliance throughout the organization, and then leads by example. The cybersecurity program is led by Hillenbrand’s Chief Information Security Officer, who provides quarterly updates to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, annual updates to the Board of Directors, and regular reports to the Executive Management Team about the program, including information about cyber risk management governance and the status of ongoing efforts to strengthen cybersecurity effectiveness. 
We also educate and share best practices globally with our employees to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats. As part of our onboarding process, we train all new employees on cybersecurity and maintain an annual retraining for all employees on cybersecurity standards, as well as how to recognize and properly respond to phishing and social engineering schemes. Hillenbrand has deployed a phishing detection system to report suspicious emails, which are flagged for further review, as well as an automated monthly process to retrain employees who do not maintain an acceptable pass rate on our phishing recognition training. To round out our robust awareness program, we have specific and regular training for our IT professionals. 
REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS
Advanced Process Solutions

Advanced Process Solutions designs, engineers, manufactures, markets, and services differentiated process and material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals, energy, recycling, and other general industrials.  Advanced Process Solutions uses its strong applications and process engineering expertise to solve problems for customers.  Its highly engineered capital equipment and systems offerings require aftermarket service and/or parts replacement, providing an opportunity for ongoing revenue at attractive margins.
Advanced Process Solutions:  Products and Services

Advanced Process Solutions’ product portfolio has grown through a series of acquisitions and includes products and services for compounding, extrusion, and material handling, as well as screening and separating. Advanced Process Solutions’ product lines are supported by aftermarket parts and services, which represented approximately 30% of Advanced Process Solutions’ total net revenue during 2022. Products are offered under brand names that are recognized among the leaders in their respective categories. 
•Compounding, Extrusion, and Material Handling Equipment and Equipment System Design

◦Twin screw compounding and extrusion machines range from small laboratory compounding machines to high performance, high throughput extrusion systems. Small and mid-sized compounders are used by customers in engineered plastics, masterbatch, PVC, recycling, biodegradable products, and other applications for the plastics, chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries.  Extrusion systems are sold to customers in multiple industries.  All of these extrusion products are sold under the Coperion® and Herbold® brands. 
◦Material handling equipment includes pneumatic and hydraulic conveying equipment for difficult-to-move materials; high-precision feeders that can operate at both very high and very low fill rates; blenders for pellets and powders; and rotary valves, diverter valves, and slide-gate valves used for feeding, dosing, discharge, and distribution during pneumatic conveying.  The proprietary equipment is highly engineered and designed to solve the needs of customers for customized solutions.  Material handling equipment is sold to a variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and minerals.  These products are sold under the Coperion®, Coperion K-Tron®, and Herbold® brands.
◦Compounding, extrusion, and material handling equipment can be sold as a complete system, where strong application and process engineering expertise is used to design and create a broad system solution for customers.  Systems can range from a single manufacturing line to large scale manufacturing lines and turnkey systems.  Larger system sales are generally fulfilled over 18 to 24 months. A considerable portion of revenue for large system sales typically comes from third-party-sourced products that carry only a small up-charge. As a result, margin percentages tend to be lower on these large system sales when compared to the rest of the reportable operating segment.  With the acquisition of Herbold in 2022, the Company now offers complete, innovative recycling solutions leveraging both Coperion and Herbold complementary technologies. From mechanical processing — shredding, washing, separating, drying, and agglomerating of plastics — to bulk material handling, feeding and extrusion, as well as compounding and pelletizing, our product offering encompasses the complete process chain. These products are sold under the Coperion® and Herbold® brands.
•Screening and Separating Equipment

◦Screening and separating equipment sorts dry, granular products based on the size of the particles being processed.  This equipment is sold under the Rotex® and BM&M® brands to customers in a variety of industries including proppants, fertilizers, chemicals, agricultural goods, plastics, forest products, and food processing.  A majority of the equipment uses a unique technology based on a specific gyratory-reciprocating motion that provides an optimal material distribution on the screens, gentle handling of particles, and accurate separations.
•Aftermarket parts and service 

◦Aftermarket parts and service are a major component of most of Advanced Process Solutions’ product lines.  Service engineers and technicians are located around the globe to better respond to customers’ machines and systems service needs.  Advanced Process Solutions offers its customers services such as installation, consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and modernization solutions.  
Advanced Process Solutions:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations

Advanced Process Solutions sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of Advanced Process Solutions’ sales is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  

Equipment and systems orders are often for unique, engineered-to-order items. Products are either assembled and tested at an Advanced Process Solutions facility and then shipped to a customer or are assembled at the customer’s desired location.

We expect that future net revenue associated with Advanced Process Solutions will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered-to-order equipment and solutions for customers. Backlog represents the amount of net revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to Advanced Process Solutions. Though backlog can be an indicator of future net revenue, it does not include projects and aftermarket orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter.  The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue.  Revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars or by provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer.
Advanced Process Solutions:  Customers

Advanced Process Solutions has customers in a wide range of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals, and recycling.  These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses.  No one Advanced Process Solutions customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2022.  For large or customized orders, customers generally pay a deposit and make progress payments in accordance with the project progress.  Often, long-term relationships are established with these customers.

Advanced Process Solutions’ sales are diversified by end markets, and further penetration of these end markets is an important element of its strategy. Geographically, approximately 24% of Advanced Process Solutions’ net revenue in 2022 came from the Americas, 51% from Asia, and 25% from EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).
We believe that long-term growth for this segment is driven by megatrends such as a rapidly growing middle class in China and India and a growing global population, resulting in rising demand for products sold in many of the end markets that Advanced Process Solutions serves, including durable plastic goods and food.  These trends include increased use of lightweight plastics in the automotive industry to improve fuel efficiency; more effective packaging in emerging markets to improve food shelf life, freshness, and safety; innovation in a variety of applications in the medical space designed to improve safety, drug and therapy delivery, and durability; increased use of engineered plastics in construction that are more durable, lightweight and require little maintenance; increased use of biopolymers to help preserve the environment; and more sustainable food sources such as plant-based proteins. Additionally, we expect Advanced Process Solutions to be able to leverage its technical know-how to win in emerging end markets such as recycling and biodegradable plastics. While overall demand for these products is expected to increase over the long run, we expect short-term periodic fluctuations in demand from time-to-time.

Advanced Process Solutions:  Competition

Advanced Process Solutions holds leading positions in key industries and has strong brand name recognition because of its commitment to serving the broad needs of customers through the design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, and its unique ability to provide compounding, extrusion and material handling equipment as a complete system that optimizes output, quality, and energy efficiency to achieve a lower overall cost of ownership for its customers. 
Advanced Process Solutions brands face strong competition. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving narrow market segments or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe Advanced Process Solutions’ diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of aftermarket business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leadership positions even during economic downturns.
Advanced Process Solutions:  Raw and Component Materials

The manufacturing of Advanced Process Solutions’ products involves the machining and welding of raw materials (primarily sheet metals and steel) and castings that are assembled with other component parts purchased from third-party suppliers that generally require particular specifications or qualifications. Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources.  Volatility in the prices Advanced Process Solutions pays for raw materials used in its products has a direct effect on profitability. Advanced Process Solutions regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various pricing and sourcing actions.  In instances where third-party suppliers are depended upon for outsourced products or components, there is risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products sold due to supplier failure. Difficulties experienced by third-party suppliers can interrupt our ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to supply products to customers. While global supply chains have recently suffered from various 
headwinds, those supporting our products have generally remained intact, providing access to sufficient inventory of the key materials needed for manufacturing. However, Advanced Process Solutions has experienced significant delays of certain raw materials and components, but has largely been able to mitigate the impact on our consolidated results of operations. Advance Process Solutions continues to identify and qualify alternative sources to mitigate risk associated to single or sole source supply continuity, and has and may continue to purchase certain materials in safety stock where we have supply chain continuity concerns. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk Factors that could impact Advanced Process Solutions’ ability to fulfill customer obligations.

The product lines within Molding Technology Solutions have strong brand recognition and an established global footprint, and we believe are well-positioned to benefit from continued robust industry growth in both developed and emerging markets. Molding Technology Solutions’ breadth of products, long history, and global reach have resulted in a large installed base of plastic processing equipment and hot runner systems.
Molding Technology Solutions:  Products and Services
Molding Technology Solutions has a product portfolio that includes injection molding and extrusion equipment and hot runner systems and process controller technology. Molding Technology Solutions maintains leadership positions across these product lines, as well as leading positions in process control systems, mold bases and components, and MRO supplies. The Molding Technology Solutions product lines are supported by aftermarket parts and services, which represented approximately 25% of Molding Technology Solutions’ total net revenue during 2022. Products are offered under brand names that are recognized as being among the leaders in their respective industries.
•Injection molding and extrusion equipment
◦Molding Technology Solutions designs, manufactures and sells plastic processing equipment and systems, which include injection molding, extrusion and auxiliary systems. This equipment is sold under the Milacron® brand to a diverse set of customers, including companies in the automotive, consumer goods, electronics, construction, medical and packaging end markets.

Recurring sales are supported by a large installed base of hot runner systems worldwide.
•Mold components
◦Molding Technology Solutions designs, manufactures, and sells high-quality mold bases and plates available in various configurations to meet the needs of customers for a variety of applications under the DME® brand. Pre-engineered assemblies, plates and components provide the economic and technical benefits of interchangeability. 
•Aftermarket parts and service

◦Aftermarket parts and service are a major component of most of the Molding Technology Solutions product lines.  Service engineers and technicians are located around the globe to better respond to customers’ machines and systems service needs.  Molding Technology Solutions offers its customers service, consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and retrofits and rebuilds.  
Molding Technology Solutions:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Molding Technology Solutions sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of Molding Technology Solutions’ sales is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  
Molding Technology Solutions does not typically have long-term supply agreements with customers, and terms are generally negotiated on an individual order basis. Pricing is set at the time of order, typically on a customized basis for each product. Raw materials and component purchases are managed based on order trends and mid-term contracts with strategic vendors, allowing Molding Technology Solutions to partially mitigate the risk of short-term changes in raw material and components pricing. The majority of hot runner and mold base equipment orders are fulfilled within three months. Injection molding and extrusion equipment orders are generally fulfilled within twelve months, but we expect some future net revenue associated with injection molding and extrusion equipment will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time in fulfilling some engineered-to-order products. Backlog represents the amount of net revenue that we expect to realize on contracts awarded to Molding Technology Solutions. Though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue, it does not include projects and aftermarket parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter. The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and net revenue. Net revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, or by provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer.
Molding Technology Solutions:  Customers
Molding Technology Solutions has customers in a wide range of industries, including automotive, medical, consumer goods, packaging, construction and electronics. These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses, including original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), molders and mold-makers. Molding Technology Solutions has long-standing relationships with its largest customers, having served many of them for over 30 years. No one Molding Technology Solutions customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2022. Customers purchasing injection molding or extrusion machines generally pay a deposit and make progress payments prior to shipment. 
Molding Technology Solutions’ sales are further diversified by end markets, and continued expansion into these end markets is an important element of its strategy. Geographically, approximately 56% of Molding Technology Solutions’ net revenue in 2022 came from the Americas, 29% from Asia, and 15% from EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).
Global population growth, coupled with continued urbanization, increased purchasing power and improved lifestyle in emerging markets and technical innovation has resulted in greater demand for a broad range of finished plastic products in many segments of the economy, including automotive, medical, construction and consumer products. We believe Molding Technology Solutions’ strong global presence positions it well to benefit from this growth. Molding Technology Solutions has made significant investments in China and India in order to capitalize on the projected growth in plastics in these markets and expects to further expand in Mexico as well.
Molding Technology Solutions: Competition
Molding Technology Solutions holds leading positions in key industries because of design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, brand name recognition, and commitment to serving the broad needs of customers. 
Molding Technology Solutions brands face strong competition in the markets where they compete. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving niche industries or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe Molding Technology Solutions’ leading product quality and design inclusion in a number of flagship products, diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of aftermarket parts business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leadership positions even during economic downturns.
Molding Technology Solutions:  Raw and Component Materials
Steel, which Molding Technology Solutions sources both directly and indirectly through its component suppliers, is the primary material used in the manufacturing of its products. Molding Technology Solutions does not enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge its commodity price risk and currently does not have a significant number of long-term supply contracts with key suppliers. Molding Technology Solutions has developed a global network of reliable, low-cost suppliers in order to secure its supply needs. Difficulties experienced by third-party suppliers can interrupt our ability to obtain materials or components and ultimately to supply products to customers. While global supply chains have recently suffered from various headwinds, those supporting Molding Technology Solutions products have generally remained intact, providing access to sufficient inventory of the key materials needed for manufacturing. However, Molding Technology Solutions has experienced significant delays of certain raw materials and components, but has largely been able to mitigate the impact on our consolidated results of operations. Molding Technology Solutions continues to identify and qualify alternative sources to mitigate risk associated to single or sole source supply continuity, and has and may continue to purchase certain materials in safety stock where we have supply chain continuity concerns. 
Volatility in the prices Molding Technology Solutions pays for raw materials used in its products, including sheet metals and steel, has a direct effect on profitability. Molding Technology Solutions regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various pricing and sourcing actions. Where possible, Molding Technology Solutions seeks alternative sources and, in some situations, is able to reformulate product with alternative materials without impacting performance, environmental, and health and safety features. We believe that Molding Technology Solutions has taken reasonable steps to mitigate recent increases to these risks. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk Factors that could impact Molding Technology Solutions’ ability to source the necessary materials to fulfill customer obligations.

Batesville
Batesville® is a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America, where it has been designing, manufacturing, distributing, and selling funeral service products and solutions to licensed funeral directors operating licensed funeral homes for more than 115 years.  
Batesville:  Products and Services
As the needs of funeral professionals and consumers have evolved, Batesville has expanded its offerings with innovative products, value-added services, and digital tools to help funeral directors assist families in creating meaningful services.  Today, the company provides a portfolio of solutions including: (1) Burial Solutions, which includes burial caskets and accounts for the majority of Batesville’s net revenue, (2) Cremation Options®, and (3) Technology Solutions. 
•Burial Solutions
◦As a recognized leader in the death care industry in North America, Batesville has been on the forefront of product innovation for more than 80 years. Batesville has introduced new interior and exterior design elements, materials, finishes, and proprietary features that align with consumer trends and preferences, while adding value for funeral professionals and consumers. Batesville’s product portfolio covers the full spectrum in variety and value, with metal and wood caskets to appeal to different consumers. In addition to its product breadth, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing materials to educate funeral directors and consumers on product and service options.
•Cremation Options®
◦The Cremation Options® platform is focused on helping funeral professionals profitably serve the growing number of consumers choosing cremation.  Batesville offers a broad line of cremation caskets, containers, urns, remembrance jewelry, and keepsakes. As with Burial Solutions, Batesville offers training, merchandising, and marketing resources to support funeral directors and consumers who select cremation. 
•Technology Solutions
◦Batesville’s technology solutions enhance the consumer experience and create business efficiencies for approximately 7,000 funeral homes and cemeteries across North America. The company offers a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services, including funeral home websites, e-commerce solutions, digital selection and arrangement software, and business management systems for funeral homes and cemeteries.
Batesville also offers an expansive assortment of personalization and memorialization elements that can be incorporated into products and services to capture the individuality of the loved one and create a unique and meaningful experience for the family. Batesville’s Family Choices® portfolio includes a wide spectrum of physical and digital personalization and memorialization offerings, including LifeSymbols® corners and display medallions, LifeView® panels, embroidered tribute panels, and the MemorySafe Drawer, which help families create memorable, meaningful funerals that celebrate a life well lived.
Batesville:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Batesville-branded caskets are marketed by a direct sales force and through digital channels only to licensed funeral professionals operating licensed funeral establishments throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.  Batesville also markets its products to select independent distribution facilities as well as full-service funeral establishments offering funeral products in conformance with state law in states that do not have specific licensing requirements.
Batesville has sales contracts in place with certain national death care service providers and also serves approximately 11,000 independent, privately owned funeral homes across North America.  None of Batesville’s customers accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated net revenue during 2022.
Batesville:  Customer Preferences and Demographics
The death of a family member causes most people to seek the services of a state-licensed funeral director.  Although caskets and urns can be purchased from a variety of sources, including internet sellers and casket stores, the overwhelming majority of consumers who arrange a funeral purchase these products directly from a funeral home. Historically, consumer spending on caskets and urns has not kept pace with inflation, negatively impacting product mix. This macroeconomic trend in consumer spending may continue, which would result in mix decline in the foreseeable future.
Demand for Batesville products and services is partially impacted by a few key external factors: U.S. and Canadian population demographics, the number of deaths annually, and the rate at which consumers select cremation. The combination of these primary factors has negatively impacted the burial volume trend over the past several decades, although periodic fluctuations in mortality rates such as seasonal outbreaks of illnesses or a pandemic can also impact demand and net revenue in a given quarter and year. As a percentage of total deaths, the estimated cremation rate at the end of calendar 2021 was approximately 58% in the U.S. and 75% in Canada (Source: Cremation Association of North America).  
Batesville:  Competition
Batesville is a recognized leader in the death care industry, competing with several national and regional casket manufacturers, as well as more than 100 independent casket distributors, most of whom serve fairly narrow geographic segments.  Some non-traditional death care providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers also sell caskets directly to consumers.  The industry has seen foreign manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada.  It is estimated that sales from these non-traditional and foreign providers collectively currently represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America. We expect declining casket demand and existing domestic over-capacity to continue to put added economic pressures on casket manufacturers and distributors. 
Batesville:  Raw Materials and Working Capital
Batesville uses carbon and stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets, wood, fabrics, finishing materials, plastic, and zinc in the manufacture of its caskets.  Although most of these raw materials are generally available from several sources, some are currently procured from a single source.
Volatility in raw material prices due to inflation or tariffs, including steel, fuel, and petroleum-based products, has a direct effect on Batesville’s profitability.  Batesville generally does not engage in hedging transactions for these purchases but does enter into fixed-price supply contracts at times.  Batesville regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material and fuel prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various sourcing actions. Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources. We believe that Batesville has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of recent increases in raw material and fuel prices as well as the recent increased risk from sole source supply continuity. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a more in-depth discussion of Risk factors that could impact Batesville’s ability to source the necessary materials to fulfill customer obligations.
Most of Batesville’s sales are made pursuant to supply agreements with its customers, and historically it has instituted annual price adjustments to help offset some, but not necessarily all, raw material cost increases.
Batesville maintains an adequate level of working capital to support the needs of its business. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements affecting working capital that are significant to understanding Batesville’s business.  
Batesville:  Strategy
While we believe there are opportunities to generate additional revenue within a wider range of death care products and services, sustaining volume in the burial casket space continues to be a top priority.  Batesville’s leadership team is focused on three strategic initiatives to sustain burial volume and support profitability:
•Grow leadership position in the death care industry
•Focus on building and delivering value propositions that align with the needs of each customer segment to continue Batesville’s mission of helping families honor the lives of those they love®.
•Utilize technology to enhance consumer and customer experience 
•Enable all customers to improve efficiencies and profitability through digital end-to-end platform, Batesville ConnectTM.
•Offer a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services.
•Use the HOM principles and tools to strengthen our leadership position and maintain an optimal cost structure to support profitability
•Continually improve processes to be more consistent and efficient and to yield industry leading quality products and services that our customers value.
HILLENBRAND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We own a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes and maintain trade secrets related to manufacturing processes.  These are important patents and trade secrets, but we do not believe any single patent or trade secret, or related group of patents or trade secrets is of material significance to our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks and service marks relating to products and services which are of importance.  We believe the marks Coperion®, Coperion K-Tron®, K-Tron®, Rotex®, BM&M®, and Herbold® were material to our Advanced Process Solutions reportable operating segment for the year ended September 30, 2022.  As TerraSource was divested in early fiscal 2022, Advanced Process Solutions no longer owns the TerraSource Global®, Pennsylvania Crusher®, Gundlach®, and Jeffrey Rader® marks, and as a result we do not believe they were material for the year ended September 30, 2022. We believe the marks Milacron®, DME®, and Mold-Masters® are material to our Molding Technology Solutions reportable operating segment. We believe the trademark Batesville® is material to our Batesville reportable operating segment.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, to an extent, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. In the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others and could continue to be.  Hillenbrand vigorously seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights.  However, we may not be sufficiently protected by our various patents, trademarks, and service marks, and they may be challenged, invalidated, cancelled, narrowed, or circumvented.  Beyond that, we may not receive the pending or contemplated patents, trademarks, or service marks for which we have applied or filed.

HILLENBRAND REGULATORY MATTERS

Advanced Process Solutions, Molding Technology Solutions, and Batesville reportable operating segments are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes. We are committed to operating all our businesses in a manner that protects the environment and makes us good corporate citizens in the communities in which we operate. In 2021, we established an Environmental Council, which includes our top operational leaders to facilitate and drive environmental priorities including energy, emissions, and operational efficiency. With the help of our Environmental Council, we disclosed our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our 2021 Sustainability Report, as well as normalized 
emissions data against total working hours in order to have a better understanding of our operational impact. In addition, we adopted new standards for our global suppliers in support of critical environmental policies and other regulatory requirements. The Environmental Council is working to maintain environmental regulatory compliance while enhancing business performance, and Hillenbrand’s Global Supply Management department engages with our suppliers to support compliance with applicable standards and legal requirements. While we believe that continued compliance with current federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to the protection of the environment and supply chain diligence will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, future events or changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future. The cost or need for any such additional expenditure is not known.
