Item 1. Business
Our Mission
 Our mission statement is: Loyalty and Data…that’s what we do.
 We are an acquisitions-focused, e-commerce holding company. Since 2018, we developed our unique SoPa branded ecosystem and acquired our #HOTTAB, Leflair, Pushkart and Handycart platforms to facilitate e-commerce transactions between our consumers and our merchants in Southeast Asia (“SEA”) (including Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Brunei). Our marketing platform empowers small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) to benefit from e-commerce opportunities in developing and frontier markets across SEA, driving job-creation and economic growth in one of the world’s most dynamic regions. We intend to continue to opportunistically acquire regional e-commerce companies and applications to drive revenues and increase the number of registered consumers and merchants in our SoPa ecosystem. As more merchants and consumers in SEA register on our Society Pass platform, more transaction data is generated. With more data generation, there are more opportunities for creating loyalty from consumers to merchants.
Our Company 
 We acquire and operate e-commerce platforms and mobile applications through our direct and indirect wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, including but not limited to Society Technology LLC, SOPA Technology Pte Ltd, SOPA Cognitive Analytics Pte Ltd, SOPA Technology Co Ltd, HOTTAB Pte Ltd and HOTTAB Vietnam Co Ltd. Along with HOTTAB Asset Vietnam Co Ltd (currently wholly-owned by one employee of HOTTAB Vietnam Co Ltd and contractually operated by HOTTAB Vietnam Co Ltd), Leflair Incorporated, Push Delivery Pte Ltd, New Retail Experience Incorporated (“NREI”), and Dream Space Co., Ltd (“Dream Space”), these twelve companies form the Society Pass Group (the “Group”). The Group currently markets to both consumers and merchants in Vietnam and Philippines while maintaining an administrative headquarters in Singapore and a software development center, which was located in India but is transitioning to a location in SEA. In February 2022, we acquired an online lifestyle platform of Leflair branded assets (the “Leflair Assets”). We recently acquired NREI and Dream Space in February 2022 and have integrated the Leflair Assets, NREI and Dream Space onto the Society Pass corporate structure and ecosystem. We plan to continue to expand our e-commerce ecosystem throughout the rest of SEA by making selective acquisitions of leading e-commerce companies and applications with particular focuses on the VIP countries (Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines) of SEA.
 
Our business currently comprises of the following four verticals: lifestyle, food and beverage (“F&B”) delivery, merchant software and loyalty. Lifestyle includes Leflair App and Leflair.com website; F&B Delivery includes Pushkart App, Pushkart.ph website, Handycart App, and Handycart.vn website. The merchant software segment includes #HOTTAB Biz App, #HOTTAB POS App and Hottab.net website, while the loyalty vertical includes Society Pass App and SoPa.asia website. In addition, we are looking at acquiring companies in the travel and digital media verticals.

Our Competitive Strengths
 Powerful and Integrated Ecosystem. Our ecosystem serves both consumers and merchants in ways that are designed to maximize value creation and enhance shopping experience. Our four unique verticals (lifestyle, F&B, merchant software, and loyalty) and five separate business units create a highly synergistic ecosystem, generating additional sales channels, and onboarding increasingly greater numbers of consumers and merchants. We leverage our verticals within our ecosystem to create multiple touch points for consumers and merchants and service them more efficiently. Our integrated technology platform and operational efficiencies drives value creation for SoPa ecosystem through our multi-faceted revenue model comprises of e-commerce revenues, delivery fees, brokerage fees, and SaaS revenues.
 Unique Loyalty Program. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we expect to launch our foundational core product, Society Points, to create permanent loyalty between consumers and merchants as well as to our Platform. Merchant and location agnostic, we believe that Society Points replace cash discounting and create permanent customer stickiness. As Society Points are merchant/location agnostic, they can be earned and redeemed across different business units within SoPa ecosystem. Society Pass and Society Points are additional marketing channels for merchants on SoPa ecosystem to onboard more customers and generate more revenues in a cost efficient manner for their individual businesses.
 Attractive Markets. We currently operate predominantly in Vietnam and Philippines, which are two of the fastest growing economies in the world. As we continue to opportunistically acquire market leading e-commerce platforms and scale up our operations, we intend to expand to other countries in SEA, especially Indonesia. Because they are attractively valued, regional acquisition opportunities allow Society Pass to quickly and more efficiently build consumer/merchant scale and expand service offerings. The VIP countries boast some of the fastest growing economies in the world, possess 500 million of SEA’s 720 million people, fast growing middle class, favorable demographics and quick adoption of mobile technology.

We received aggregate proceeds from the public offering of $11.5 million before deducting underwriting fees and commission and other offering expenses.
Our Market Opportunity
 We expect that continued strong economic expansion, robust population growth, rising level of urbanization, the emergence of the middle class and the increasing rate of adoption of mobile technology provide market opportunities for our Company in SEA. As of 2020, SEA gross domestic product (“GDP”) totaled US$3.1 trillion. In comparison, the respective GDP for both the European Union (“EU”) and the United States (“US”) totaled US$15 trillion and US$20.8 trillion in 2020. SEA has experienced rapid economic growth rates in recent years, far exceeding growth in major world economies such as Japan, the EU and the US. According to the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) since 2010, SEA has averaged 4.6% GDP growth, compared to 0.7% for Japan, 0.8% for the EU and 1.7% for the US. Vietnam’s GDP growth averaged 6.1% from 2011 to 2020 and is expected to average 7% for the next five years. The size of Vietnam’s economy grew from US$39 billion in 2000 to US$340 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach US$530 billion by 2025. SMEs are a dynamic, driving force in Vietnam’s economy, contributing 40% to its GDP last year.
 SEA continues to enjoy robust population growth. The United Nations Population Division estimates that the population of the SEA countries in 2000 was approximately 525 million people growing to 668 million in 2020. Vietnam has a population of approximately 98 million people today compared to 80 million people in 2000.
 This population growth is driving rising levels of urbanization. Mirroring the demographic trends in China more than 25 years ago, Vietnamese are moving to cities in greater numbers. In the past two decades, Vietnam’s urbanization rate has increased steadily at approximately 3% per year since 2000, with 36% of the population now living in cities. This urbanization trend is highly correlated with the growth of the middle class. Simply put, urbanization drives middle class consumption demand. According to the World Bank, Vietnam’s middle class currently accounts for 13% of the population and is expected to reach 26% by 2026. Fitch Solutions predicts that Vietnam’s real household spending will expand at an annual average annual growth rate of 7.5% year-on-year from 2021 to 2024.

And despite the ongoing effects from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Internet economy continues to boom in SEA. According to Google Temasek e-Conomy SEA 2020 Report, Internet usage in the region increased with 40 million new users added in 2020 for a total of 400 million compared to 360 million in 2019. Seventy percent of SEA’s population is now online, compared to approximately twenty percent in 2009. In addition, SEA mobile Internet penetration now reaches more than 67%. E-commerce, online media and food delivery adoption and usage surged with the total value of goods and services sold via the Internet, or gross merchandise value (“GMV”), in SEA, expected to reach more than US$100 billion by year end 2020 according to Google, Temasek, Bain SEA Report 2020. In fact, the SEA Internet sector GMV is forecast to grow to over US$300 billion by 2025.
 Vietnam’s mobile penetration rate has reached 95% in city areas and among SEA countries, Vietnamese consumers spend the most time online for personal purposes, just after Singaporean users. According to Google Temasek e-Conomy SEA 2020 Report, total GMV of e-Commerce spending in Vietnam is currently US$ 14 billion and is forecast to grow to over US$ 50 billion by 2025.
 We believe that these ongoing positive economic and demographic trends in SEA propelled demand for our Platform.
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded revenues of $34,830 and $40,719, respectively, from Aryaduta Hospitality & Leisure Group, which in fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 accounted for approximately 5% and 75% of our revenues, respectively.
 We incurred net losses of $34,760,640 and $3,864,740 in fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Our Business Model
 Our four inter-connected verticals (lifestyle, F&B, merchant software and loyalty) and 5 unique business units connect millions of registered consumers and thousands of merchants in SEA. For our consumers, we offer personalized promotions on our Leflair, Pushkart and Handycart platforms. For our merchants, we sell POS software, vendor finance and customized merchant marketing programs. And we expect to offer Society Points in the second quarter of 2022. Our business model incents both consumers and merchants to transact with one another to receive personalized offers, Society Points (when launched) and generate revenues.
 Our Platform consists of seven interconnected interfaces:
 
1) | Society Pass Loyalty App;

Our Growth Strategy
 Simply put, our growth strategy is to onboard as many consumers and merchants as possible onto our Platform. Our virtuous cycle of consumer and merchant engagement is as follows: As more consumers and more merchants in SEA register on our Society Pass platform, more transaction data is generated. With more data generation, there are more opportunities for creating loyalty from consumers to merchants. SoPa’s ecosystem allows for:

• | More revenue generation for merchants leads to creation of customer loyalty; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More customer loyalty creation leads to more consumers for merchants; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More consumers for merchants leads to greater revenues for merchants; which results in and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | virtuous cycle of revenue generation and loyalty creation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our goal is to make Society Pass the preferred e-commerce ecosystem for both consumers and merchants in SEA. Our Society Pass loyalty product allows merchants to create sticky interactions with their consumers. Our Leflair e-commerce platform allows premium international and domestic brands to reach a wider consumer base. We aim to make our #HOTTAB merchants successful by connecting them to a large consumer base along with the technology and marketing tools to maximize their sales. Our Pushkart and Handycart F&B delivery platforms provides consumers with convenient grocery and restaurant delivery options which alleviate time constraints on their busy lifestyles. In doing so, we engage our registered consumers with a reliable and user-friendly e-commerce ecosystem that serves all of their needs in the F&B and lifestyle verticals. This virtuous marketing cycle creates permanent customer loyalty to our Platform, which continuously drives consumer traffic, merchant participation and revenues.

The key elements of our growth strategy are as follows:
 Acquiring other e-Commerce companies and applications in SEA
 To complement our organic growth strategy, we will continue to opportunistically acquire regional e-commerce companies and applications to drive revenues and increase the number of registered consumers and merchants in our SoPa ecosystem throughout SEA with particular focuses on Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia. Our anticipated investments and acquisitions of other e-commerce platforms and applications in different verticals are expected to expand our service offerings and attract new consumers and merchants. Our acquisition of #HOTTAB in November 2019, for example, allowed us to start marketing and selling to merchants in Vietnam. Our acquisition of the Leflair Assets in February 2021 allowed us to market and sell lifestyle products to consumers in Vietnam. Our acquisitions of NREI and Dream Space in February 2022 allowed us to deliver F&B products to consumers in Philippines and Vietnam, respectively. The Company is currently negotiating with acquisition targets in the lifestyle, F&B and travel verticals in SEA.
 
Launching our Loyalty System
 Beginning in second quarter of 2022, we intend to market our unique merchant agnostic and universal Society Points to generate additional revenues for merchants and create permanent customer loyalty in SEA. Our Society Points are expected to play a pivotal role in attracting merchants to our Platform as they allow merchants to build permanent customer loyalty and more cost effectively market to new consumers and retain existing consumers. For consumers, Society Points will offer them both a cashless payment option and the ability to spend bonus points accumulated from one consumer vertical such as lifestyle to a separate one such as F&B.
Entering into Strategic Partnerships
 The Company has entered into agreements with the following Vietnamese companies to provide essential services to the Platform:
 Lala Move Vietnam Co. Ltd  (“Lala Move”) and Tikinow Smart Logistics Co. Ltd (“Tikinow”) provides food delivery services for the Platform; VTC Technology and Digital Content Company  (“VTC Pay”), Media Corporation (Vietnam Post Telecommunication Media)  (“VNPT Pay”), Zion Joint DStock Company (“Zalo Pay”), and Online Mobile Service Joint Stock Co. (“Momo”) provide payment integration services to the Platform which allows merchants to process consumer transactions; SHBank Finance Co. Ltd  (“SHB”) provides vendor financing to merchants on the Platform; Triip Pte. Ltd (“Triip”) provides travel agency services to the Platform; Paytech Company Limited (“Paytec”) provides payment integration and loyalty services to the Platform that allows merchants to process transactions with consumers; and Rainbow Loyalty Company Limited (“Rainbow”) provides loyalty services for merchants on the Platform. The aforementioned companies are collectively referred to in this Annual Report as “Strategic Partners”. 
 Strategic partnerships are vital to the strategy and operations of Society Pass ecosystem as they enable our Platform to offer more value-added services to both our consumers and merchants. We are constructing a regional loyalty alliance comprising of synergistic merchant partners. Through our partnerships, we gain access to our partners’ clients and users at minimal cost where possible and to proliferate the usage of Society Points (when available). From our partnerships, we also enhance our offerings like reliable delivery services through our relationships with delivery service providers and vendor financing options through our partnerships with financial institutions. Our marketing approach to acquire strategic partners focuses on the benefits of joining our Loyalty Alliance, stressing the ability to access a larger pool of consumers and clients while reducing marketing expenses via joint marketing efforts like press interviews, brochures and co-branding initiatives with merchants.
 Maximizing the value of consumer transactions
 Growing our consumer base, converting registered consumers into active ones, increasing transaction frequency, and maximizing basket sizes are key growth drivers for our lifestyle and F&B verticals. We are growing our base of registered consumers through a multi-pronged marketing approach across social media, emails, SMS, QR codes, tailored promotional campaigns and public relations engagement. Through these marketing approaches, we promote features of the SoPa branded interfaces as well as end-to-end capabilities from searches to orders to payments and finally to delivery. We believe that by serving consumers in all aspects of their daily lives, we create more opportunities to cross-sell and thus maximize our consumer wallet share.

Developing our data and analytics capabilities
 We will further investing in identifying and mentoring female executives, acquiring entrepreneurial talent and hiring gifted software developers and marketing professionals to build the next generation digital ecosystem in Southeast Asia.
 Expanding service offerings to merchants
 Merchants are a critical component of our business, thus growing our registered merchant base and serving them with desirable technology and marketing solutions to improve sales, cut costs, and realize operational efficiencies. We onboard merchants through marketing outreach tools such as our websites, public relations, social media and focused sales efforts. In our marketing messages, we attract merchants to our ecosystem by offering them access to our growing consumer base as well as numerous opportunities to optimize their sales, including enhanced customer loyalty through the expected launch of our Society Points in the second quarter of 2022.
 Expectation of Competition
 We operate a loyalty-focused e-commerce ecosystem that connects consumers with merchants in the F&B delivery and lifestyle sectors. Across these verticals, we compete with other online platforms for merchants, who can sell their products on other food ordering platforms or online lifestyle retail marketplaces. We also compete with companies that sell software and services such as Software-as-a-Service providers and point-of-sale module vendors, enabling a merchant to run its business independently of our platform. We expect to be able to compete for merchants based on our unique Society Points feature once launched, which we expect will build lasting customer loyalty for our merchants, as well as our personalized, data-driven approach to customer engagement, both of which ensure that our success is aligned with that of our merchants’.
 We also compete with other e-commerce platforms, fashion retailers and restaurants for the attention of the consumer. Consumers have the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailers, large marketplaces or restaurant chains that may also have the ability to build their own independent online platforms.
