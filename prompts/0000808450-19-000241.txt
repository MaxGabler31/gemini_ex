Our Strategy 
Our Business
Our Core business is the truck and parts markets for the U.S. and Canada, where we participate primarily in the Class 6 through 8 vehicle markets and this year expanded into the Class 4/5 market with our International® CV™ product. With more than a million of our trucks on the road in the U.S. and Canada, one in five Class 6 through 8 vehicles is an International® truck. Nearly half of all school buses on the road today are our IC brand. We have one of the largest commercial vehicle parts distribution networks in the U.S. and a captive finance company. Further, this year we put into operation a partnership with Love’s Travel Stops expanding our service network in North America through our Dealers and Network Service Partners to over 1,000 locations, one of the largest networks in North America. Outside of our Core markets, International® is one of the leading truck brands in Mexico and much of Latin America. We are the largest independent diesel engine company in Brazil, with our wholly-owned subsidiary International Industria Automotiva da America do Sul Ltda. (“IIAA”), formerly MWM International Industria de Motores da America Do Sul Ltda. We also export trucks, buses, and engines to niche markets around the world.
We continue to take actions that we believe will improve our performance and evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our customers. The following is a summary of our 2019 accomplishments and our expectations going forward.
Our 2019 Accomplishments
We continue to demonstrate the growth of our business, focusing our efforts on becoming the #1 choice in our industry. In 2019, we made several notable advancements on our strategic vision.

I. | Customer-Centric: Our focus on customer and market segmentation to better align our efforts with customer needs led to the following accomplishments in 2019:


• | Opened a new parts distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi near the FedEx World Hub in Memphis, Tennessee will provide next day parts delivery to 95% of our dealer locations


• | Enhanced our predictive parts stocking through digitalization


• | Expanded to the industry’s largest service network with over 1,000 locations through our partnership with Love’s Travel Stops

II. | Operational Excellence: We made improvements to operations as follows:


• | Reduced our warranty expense as a percentage of manufacturing revenue from 1.7% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2019


• | Announced investments in our manufacturing footprint to expand our capabilities in Huntsville, Alabama for an integrated powertrain with TRATON Group and building a benchmark truck manufacturing facility in San Antonio, Texas


III. | Core Business: We now have the industry’s newest and most comprehensive vehicle line-up supported by our unique open architecture all-brands remote diagnostic system OnCommand Connection ("OCC"). In addition:


• | Our core market share improved from 17.5% in 2018 to 18.8% in 2019


• | We expanded the footprint of parts availability by adding 5 new Fleetrite retail outlets in the U.S. and Canada


V. | Business Transformation: Our strategic transformation has been and will continue to be a crucial element of how we play to win. The following are a few ways we have gained significant momentum during 2019:


• | Created a new aftersales function that will manage every facet of the business after the initial sale of the truck, including oversight of parts and service, warranty, and dealer development


• | Launched a new business unit, NEXT eMobility Solutions ("NEXT"), to deliver customized electrification solutions in the truck and school bus markets using lean, agile practices. NEXT establishes a comprehensive "four Cs" approach to developing eMobility solutions: Consulting, Constructing, Charging and Connecting


• | Additional actions to de-risk the balance sheet through the purchase of a Canadian pension annuity, paying off $411 million in subordinated convertible notes with cash on hand in April, expanding the revolving credit facilities of NFC, and ending the year with $1.4 billion in consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities


• | Selling off non-core business units including a 70% equity interest in our former defense business, ND Holdings, LLC (“Navistar Defense”), and our ownership interest in our former joint venture in China with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd (“JAC”)

We believe these actions coupled with our strategic alliance with the TRATON Group and our winning culture anchored by our high performing cross-functional teams, continue to position us for success.
Our Expectations Going Forward
Moving forward, we will continue our intense focus on costs to fund our growth initiatives, grow our market share and margins, and deliver superior shareholder return. We are focused on our Navistar 4.0 playing to win strategy, which is based on three critical elements:

• | People: Driving high performing cross-functional teams while recruiting and developing key leadership roles by:


◦ | Expanding on our lean culture through visual management, agile approaches, and a focus on execution


◦ | Developing our best resources and redeploying resources to focus on our growth initiatives, and


◦ | Leveraging our strong values


• | Performance: Creating a sustainable long-term performance advantage within our products and services by investing in those areas with the greatest impact on our margins and overall financial performance. These areas include the following:

 6


• | #1 Choice: Identifying and focusing on key markets where we have a differentiated value, defining how we will operate in that market, and how to prove to our customers that we are their #1 choice by:


◦ | Following a Listen - Understand - Deliver approach to provide our customers what they truly need to succeed


◦ | Understanding our customers better than our competitors, ensuring that our products and services provide value to our customers, and by organizing to be aligned with our customers


◦ | Ensuring our products and services provide leading uptime and low total cost of ownership


◦ | Strengthening our brand and residual values to capture more of the 2nd and 3rd owner markets, and


◦ | Strengthening our dealers and building stronger partnerships with them through our Vision 2025 strategy

We believe Navistar 4.0 is built upon the right vision and the right strategy. We are confident that success will result in “the best team”, an operating performance advantage, and a brand preference that will result in our leadership in key markets and continued improvement in our financial performance. 
Our Operating Segments 
We operate in four industry segments: Truck, Parts, Global Operations (collectively referred to as "Manufacturing operations"), and Financial Services, which consists of NFC and our foreign finance operations (collectively referred to as "Financial Services operations"). Corporate contains those items that do not fit into our four segments. Selected financial data for each segment can be found in Note 15, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Truck Segment 
Our Truck segment manufactures and distributes Class 4 through 8 trucks and buses along with production of proprietary engines, primarily in the North America markets that include the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Our Truck segment also includes our truck export business under the International and IC brands. The proprietary engines produced in North America are primarily used in our trucks and buses. Our goal is to deliver the highest quality commercial trucks and buses. The Truck segment is our largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues. 
We compete primarily in our Core (collectively referred to as school buses, Class 6 and 7 medium trucks, Class 8 heavy trucks and Class 8 severe service trucks) markets. The Truck segment's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Mexico consist principally of assembling components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as designing, engineering, and producing certain sheet metal components, including truck cabs, and proprietary engines. 
The Truck segment's manufacturing operations also include the production of diesel engines, which are primarily used in our trucks. The operations at our engine manufacturing facility consist principally of the assembly of components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as machining operations relating to steel and grey-iron components. We market our commercial products directly to large fleets which offer a comprehensive range of services and other support functions to our end users. Our commercial trucks are distributed in virtually all key markets through our distribution and retail service network, which is comprised of 1,052 outlets in the U.S. and Canada, which includes 342 of Love’s Travel Stops locations, 89 outlets in Mexico, and our export truck operations, primarily in Latin America. In addition, our network of used truck centers and International certified used truck dealers in the U.S. and Canada provides trade-in support to our dealers and national accounts group, and markets all makes and models of reconditioned used trucks to owner-operators and fleet buyers.
The Truck business competes on many dimensions, including customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, uptime, and parts availability. The markets in which the Truck segment competes are subject to considerable volatility and fluctuation in response to cycles in the overall business environment. These markets are particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Government regulation has also impacted, and will continue to impact, trucking operations as well as the efficiency and specifications of trucking equipment. 
The Class 4 through 8 truck and bus markets in North America are highly competitive. Major U.S.-controlled domestic competitors include PACCAR Inc. ("PACCAR"), which sells vehicles under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates in North America, and Ford Motor Company ("Ford"). Competing foreign-controlled domestic manufacturers include Freightliner and Western Star (both subsidiaries of Daimler-Benz AG ("Mercedes Benz")), Volvo and Mack (both subsidiaries of Volvo Global Trucks), and Hino (a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation ("Toyota")). In addition, smaller, foreign-controlled market participants such as Isuzu Motors America, Inc. ("Isuzu"), UD Trucks North America (a subsidiary of AB Volvo ("UD Trucks")), and Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. ("Mitsubishi") are competing in the U.S. and Canadian truck markets with primarily imported products. In Mexico, the major domestic competitors are Kenmex (a subsidiary of PACCAR) and Freightliner. In our primary truck export market of Latin America, we compete with many truck manufacturers, including PACCAR, Freightliner, and Mack.

Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for Truck sales to external customers.
Parts Segment 
Our Parts segment provides customers with proprietary products needed to support the International commercial truck, IC Bus, proprietary engine lines, and export parts business, as well as our other product lines by providing customers with proprietary products together with a wide selection of other standard truck, trailer, and engine service parts. We distribute service parts through the dealer network that supports our trucks and engines. The Parts segment is our second largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues and generates a significant portion of our net income.
Our extensive dealer channel provides us with an advantage in serving our customers by having our parts available when and where our customers require service. Goods are delivered to our customers either through one of our twelve parts distribution centers operated out of North America, or through direct shipment from our suppliers. We have a dedicated parts sales team within North America, as well as national account teams focused on large fleet customers. We also serve our global markets through our dedicated export business which supports customers globally in Latin America, the Middle East, northern Africa, South Africa, Europe, Australia, Asia and Russia. In conjunction with the Truck sales and technical service group, we provide an integrated support team that works to find solutions to support our customers. 
To be competitive the Parts Segment must focus on customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, and parts availability. We sell a substantial amount of all-make parts for light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks ("All-Make parts"), which are common across OEM truck manufacturers. We sell remanufactured parts through our ReNEWed product line and private label products through our Fleetrite brand name. The dealers and fleets have multiple outlets to purchase All-Make parts including other OEMs (including but not limited to Freightliner, PACCAR, Mack and Volvo), independent distributors, and traditional retail outlets, including Fleetpride, TruckPro, and National Auto Parts Association ("Napa"). We sell a wide-range of proprietary parts and we are subject to varying degrees of competition for many of our proprietary parts from alternative parts-providers and independent remanufacturers. 
Also included in the Parts segment is our Blue Diamond Parts, LLC ("BDP") joint venture with Ford, which manages the sourcing, merchandising and distribution of certain service parts for North America Ford diesel vehicles. Major competitors for our BDP joint venture include Alliant Power, Jasper Engine Transmissions, and Delphi Automotive. In October 2019, Ford notified the Company of its intention to dissolve the BDP joint venture effective October 2021.
Refer to Note 15, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, for Parts sales to external customers.
Global Operations Segment 
Our Global Operations segment includes businesses that derive revenue from outside our Truck and Parts segments and primarily consists of the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, International Indústria Automotiva da América do Sul Ltda. ("IIAA"). IIAA is a leader in the South American mid-range diesel engine market, manufacturing and distributing mid-range diesel engines and providing customers with additional engine offerings in the agriculture, marine, genset, and light truck markets. Additionally, we also sell our engines to global OEMs for various on-and-off-road applications. We offer contract manufacturing services under IIAA's MWM brand to OEMs for the assembly of their engines, particularly in South America. IIAA has a very significant dealer network and parts distribution center, responsible for internal and export sales of spare parts. As part of the Global Operations segment, IIAA has engine manufacturing operations in Brazil. The Global Operations segment is our third largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues.
Our commercial products are marketed through our independent dealer network, which offers a comprehensive range of services and other support functions to our end users.
IIAA also has a commercial agreement with an Indian company, Mahindra Heavy Engines Ltd. ("Mahindra"), under which MWM engines (4.8L and 7.2L) are manufactured at a plant located in the Chakan Industrial Area in the city of Pune, India. The engines produced at that plant are exclusively sold by MWM outside of the Indian market, providing a cost competitive export platform in support of the Asian markets.
In Brazil, IIAA's engines compete with Cummins, Mercedes Benz, and Fiat Powertrain ("FPT") in the light and medium truck markets; Mercedes Benz, Cummins, Scania, MAN, Volvo, and FPT in the heavy truck market; Mercedes Benz in the bus market; New Holland (a subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V.), Sisu Diesel (a subsidiary of AGCO Corporation), and Deere & Company in the agricultural market; and Scania and Cummins in the stationary market.

Financial Services Segment 
Our Financial Services segment provides and manages wholesale, retail, and lease financing of products sold by the Truck and Parts segments and their dealers. We also finance wholesale and retail accounts receivable. Substantially all revenues earned by the Financial Services segment are derived from supporting the sales of our vehicles and products. The Financial Services segment continues to meet the primary goal of providing and managing financing to our customers in U.S., Canadian and Mexican markets by providing or arranging cost-effective funding sources, while working to mitigate credit losses and impaired vehicle asset values. NFC provides wholesale financing for 100% of new Truck inventory sold to our dealers and distributors in the U.S. through the customary free interest period offered by NI. At October 31, 2019 and 2018, NFC retained floor plan financing for approximately 72% and 74% of the dealers, respectively, after the expiration of any free interest period. The Financial Services segment also facilitates financing relationships in other countries to support our Manufacturing Operations.
The Financial Services segment manages the relationship with Navistar Capital (a program of BMO Harris Bank N.A. and Bank of Montreal (together, "BMO")). Navistar Capital is our third-party preferred source of retail and lease customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the U.S. In addition, Navistar Capital Canada (also a BMO program) provides financing to support the sale of our products in Canada.
Engineering and Product Development 
Our engineering and product development programs are focused on the development of new products, enhancements of current products, quality improvements and continuous material cost reductions across our product lines, complying with future regulatory requirements, and investigating future technologies for our product lines.  We have shifted our investment focus to developing driver-centric designs with world class uptime and fuel economy that incorporates industry leading connected technologies utilizing Navistar’s OCC open architecture telematics solution. In 2019, we completed the launch of the Horizon suite of vehicles for the Global markets and also launched the International CV Series in conjunction with General Motors Company ("GM") for the Class 4/5 market. 
In 2020, Navistar’s product development programs will be developing advances in aerodynamics, powertrain and software systems that are increasing fuel efficiency in the International LT and RH Series on-highway vehicles. In addition, we will be introducing to our products further enhancements in our Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) offerings, more fuel efficient features, and engines to comply with the 2021 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) requirements. Navistar will continue to invest in ADAS, connected technologies and electric vehicles, working with strategic suppliers and partners. We introduced our first electric medium duty vehicle at the recent North American Commercial Vehicle Show. We believe that the alliance with TRATON Group will further expand our capabilities in these areas.
We participate in very competitive markets with more stringent regulatory requirements and faster technology adoptions, and we continue to believe that our strong commitment to engineering and product development is required to drive long-term growth. Our engineering and product development costs were $319 million in 2019, compared to $297 million in 2018 and $251 million in 2017. We expect that GHG phase 2 regulations announced in 2016 will drive significant investments in product development by us and our competitors.
Backlog
We define order backlogs ("backlogs") as orders yet to be built as of the end of the period. Our backlogs do not represent guarantees of purchases by customers or dealers and are subject to cancellation. 
The following table provides our worldwide backlog of unfilled truck orders as of October 31, 2019 and 2018:

 | Units | Value 
As of October 31: | | (in billions)
2019 | 41,800 | | $ | 2.5
2018 | 51,000 | | 3.9 | 

Production of our October 31, 2019 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2020. The backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand; factors such as changes in production rates, internal and supplier available capacity, new product introductions, and competitive pricing actions may affect point-in-time comparisons. 
Employees 
As our business requirements change, fluctuations may occur within our workforce from year to year. We carefully managed our attrition, approving the replacement of key positions that we believe are critical to sustaining the improved business performance in 2019. For more information, see Note 3, Restructurings, Impairments and Divestitures, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion related to the risk associated with labor and work stoppages. 
Patents and Trademarks 
We seek and obtain patents on our inventions and own a significant patent portfolio. Additionally, many of the components we purchase for our products are protected by patents that are owned or controlled by the component manufacturer. We license third-party patents for the manufacture of our products and also grant licenses of our patents. The monetary royalties paid or received under these licenses are not material.
Our primary trademarks are an important part of our worldwide sales and marketing efforts and provide clear identification of our products and services in the marketplace. To support these efforts, we maintain, or have pending, registrations of our primary trademarks in those countries in which we do business or expect to do business. We grant licenses under our trademarks for consumer-oriented goods, such as toy trucks and apparel, outside the product lines that we manufacture. The monetary royalties received under these licenses are not material.
Supply 
We purchase raw materials, parts, and manufactured components from numerous third-party suppliers. To avoid duplicate tooling expenses and to maximize volume benefits, single-source suppliers fill a majority of our requirements for parts and manufactured components. Some parts and manufactured components are generic to the industry while others are of a proprietary design requiring unique tooling, which require additional effort to relocate. However, we believe our exposure to a disruption in production as a result of an interruption of raw materials and supplies is no greater than the industry as a whole.
Our costs for trucks and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel, precious metals, resins, and petroleum products. We continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of market-based commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes, material substitution, alternate supplier resourcing, global sourcing efforts, and hedging activities. The objective of this strategy is to ensure cost stability and competitiveness in an often volatile global marketplace. Generally, the impact of commodity cost fluctuations in the global market will be reflected in our financial results on a delayed basis, depending on many factors including the terms of supplier contracts, special pricing arrangements, and any commodity hedging strategies employed.
Impact of Government Regulation 
Truck and engine manufacturers continue to face significant governmental regulation of their products, especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters, including on-highway emissions standards which require reducing allowable particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"). Meeting these emissions standards resulted in a significant increase in the cost of our products.
In 2010, the initial phase-in of onboard diagnostic ("OBD") requirements commenced for the initial family of truck engines and those products were certified. The phase-in for the remaining engine families occurred in 2013. Canadian heavy-duty engine emissions regulations essentially mirror those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"). In Mexico, we offer EPA 2004 and Euro IV engines that comply with current standards in that country. Mexico lowered NOx emission standards in 2019 and will be lowering NOx emission standards in 2021 to Euro V and VI levels, respectively. Navistar Heavy Duty Diesel ("HDD") engines meet the EURO V and VI with current controls technology.
 10

Truck manufacturers are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal, state, and local regulations. As the engine is one of a truck's primary sources of noise, we invest a great deal of effort to develop strategies to reduce engine noise. We are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act ("Safety Act") and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ("Safety Standards") promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA").
Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. Because our products use fossil fuels, they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation, such as a cap and trade program, affecting the cost of fuels. The EPA and the NHTSA issued final rules for GHG emissions and fuel economy in 2011, which were fully implemented in model year 2017. We are complying with these rules through use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available. The EPA and NHTSA adopted a final rule in October 2016 with a second phase of federal GHG emission and fuel economy regulations. This rule contains significantly more stringent emissions levels for engines and vehicles, which will require substantial investments of capital. The GHG emission standards in the rule will take effect in model year 2021 and be implemented in three stages culminating in model year 2027. We continue to assess the impact of the rule on us and our stakeholders as we develop our product planning for that period.
Canada adopted its version of fuel economy and GHG emission regulations in February 2013. These regulations are substantially aligned with U.S. fuel economy and GHG emission regulations. Canada has finalized heavy duty phase 2 GHG rulemaking, which is substantially similar to EPA regulations with more stringent requirements for heavy haul tractors.
In December 2014, California adopted GHG emission rules for heavy duty vehicles equivalent to EPA phase 1 rules and is in the process of adopting its phase 2 equivalent rules. In 2014 California also adopted an optional lower emission standard for NOx in California. California has stated its intention to lower NOx standards for California-certified engines and has requested that the EPA lower its standards. In June 2016, several regional air quality management districts in California and other states, as well as the environmental agencies for several states, petitioned the EPA to adopt lower NOx emission standards for on-road heavy duty trucks and engines. In addition to lower NOx, EPA and the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") may consider other actions, including extending emission warranty periods. On November 14, 2018 the EPA announced the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative” which will begin the regulatory process for a reduced NOx emissions regulation while also streamlining compliance and certification requirements. In addition to lower NOx, EPA and California may consider other actions, including extending warranty periods, mandating sales of zero emission trucks, and requiring certification of zero emission heavy duty vehicles. We will monitor and participate in this rulemaking. We expect that heavy duty vehicle and engine fuel economy and GHG emissions rules will be under consideration in other global jurisdictions in the future. These standards will require significant investments of capital, will significantly increase costs of development for engines and vehicles, and will require us to incur administrative costs arising from implementation of the standards.
The EPA also issued a final rule in October 2015 that lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to 70 parts per billion. This rule could lead to future lower emission standards for substances that contribute to ozone, including NOx from vehicles, at the federal and state levels.
Our facilities may be subject to regulation related to climate change, and climate change itself may also have some impact on our operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and we cannot predict the nature and scope of those impacts.
