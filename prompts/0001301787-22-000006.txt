ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
BlueLinx is a leading wholesale distributor of residential and commercial building products in the United States. We are a “two-step” distributor. Two-step distributors purchase products from manufacturers and distribute those products to dealers and other suppliers in local markets, who then sell those products to end users. We carry a broad portfolio of both branded and private-label stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across two principal product categories: specialty products and structural products. Specialty products include items such as engineered wood, industrial products, cedar, moulding, siding, metal products, and insulation. Structural products include items such as lumber, plywood, oriented strand board, rebar, and remesh. We also provide a wide range of value-added services and solutions aimed at relieving distribution and logistics challenges for our customers and suppliers, while enhancing their marketing and inventory management capabilities.
With a strong market position, broad geographic coverage footprint servicing over 40 states, and the strength of a locally focused sales force, we distribute a comprehensive range of products from over 750 suppliers, including some of the leading manufacturers in the industry, such as Ply Gem, Huber Engineered Woods, Georgia-Pacific, Allura, James Hardie, Fiberon, Royal, Oldcastle APG, Louisiana-Pacific, and Weyerhaeuser. We supply products to a broad base of over 15,000 national, regional, and local dealers, specialty distributors, national home centers, and manufactured housing customers, many whom serve residential and commercial builders and contractors in their respective geographic areas and local markets.
As a value-added partner in a complex and demanding building products supply chain, we play a critical role in enabling our customers to offer a broad range of products and brands, as most of our customers do not have the capability to purchase and warehouse products directly from manufacturers for such a large set of SKUs. The depth of our geographic footprint supports meaningful customer proximity across the markets in which we operate, enabling faster and more efficient service. Similarly, we provide value to our supplier partners by enabling access to the large and fragmented network of lumber yards and dealers that those suppliers could not adequately serve directly. Our position in this distribution model for building products provides easy access to the marketplace for our suppliers and the value proposition of rapid delivery on an as-needed basis to our customers from our network of warehouse facilities.
Our Strategy
We remain committed to driving a culture of profitable growth within new and existing product lines and geographies, while positioning the company for long-term value creation. The following strategic initiatives represent key areas of our management team’s focus: 
1.Foster a performance-driven culture committed to profitable growth. This includes enhancing the customer experience; accelerating organic growth within specific product and solutions offerings where the company is uniquely advantaged; and deploying capital to drive sustained margin expansion, grow cash flow and maintain continued profitable growth.
2.Migrate sales mix toward higher-margin specialty product categories. The company intends to pursue a revenue mix increasingly weighted toward higher-margin, specialty product categories such as engineered wood, moulding, millwork, decking and industrial products. Additionally, the company intends to expand its value-added service offerings designed to simplify complex customer sourcing requirements, together with marketing, inventory and pricing services afforded by the company’s national platform.
3.Maintain a disciplined capital structure and pursue high-return investments that increase the value of the company. The company intends to maintain a disciplined capital structure while prudently investing in its business to modernize its trailer fleet and distribution facilities and to improve operational performance. The company also continues to evaluate potential acquisition targets that complement its existing capabilities, grow its specialty products business, increase customer exposure, expand its geographic reach, or a combination thereof. To improve operational performance and productivity, we invested $14.4 million in cash during fiscal 2021. Of the $14.4 million in cash invested in fiscal 2021, $9.0 million was invested in the fourth quarter.
Products and Services
We distribute products in two principal categories: specialty products and structural products. Specialty products, which represented approximately 59 percent and 60 percent of our fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 net sales, respectively, include primarily engineered wood products, moulding, siding and trim, cedar, metal products (excluding rebar and remesh) and insulation. Structural products, which represented approximately 41 percent and 40 percent of our fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 net sales, respectively, include plywood, oriented strand board, rebar and remesh, lumber, spruce and other wood products primarily used for structural support in construction projects. In some cases, these products are branded by us.
We also provide a wide range of value-added services and solutions to our customers and suppliers including:
•providing “less-than-truckload” delivery services;
•pre-negotiated program pricing plans;
•inventory stocking;
•automated order processing through an electronic data interchange, or “EDI,” that provides a direct link between us and our customers;
•intermodal distribution services, including railcar unloading and cargo reloading onto customers’ trucks; 
•milling and fabrication services; and
•backhaul services, when otherwise empty trucks are returning from customer deliveries.
Distribution Channels
We sell products through three main distribution channels: warehouse sales, reload sales, and direct sales.
Warehouse sales are delivered from our warehouses to our customers. Reload sales are similar to warehouse sales, but are delivered from third-party warehouses where we store owned products to enhance operating efficiencies. This channel is employed primarily to service strategic customers that would be less economical to service from our warehouses, and to distribute large volumes of imported products from port facilities. Together, warehouse and reload sales accounted for approximately 81 percent and 83 percent of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 gross sales, respectively. 
Direct sales are shipped from the manufacturer to the customer without our taking physical possession of the inventory and, as a result, typically generate lower margins than our warehouse and reload distribution channels. This distribution channel requires the lowest amount of committed capital and fixed costs. Direct sales accounted for approximately 19 percent and 17 percent of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 gross sales, respectively.
Human Capital
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
We are committed to diversifying our workforce to ensure that our associates feel like they belong. We realize the value that diversity, equity and inclusion bring to our business. As of January 1, 2022, women represented 14 percent of our associate population, 20 percent of our executive leadership team, and 29 percent of our Board of Directors, and minorities represented 27 percent of our associate population, 40 percent of our executive leadership team, and 14 percent of our Board of Directors. We will continue to monitor and seek to increase our diversity. 
We also use our compensation review process, our compensation framework, and third-party compensation data in an effort to compensate associates in the same job, level and location fairly regardless of gender, race and ethnicity. Where we have identified discrepancies between actual compensation and our policies, we have taken action to make pay adjustments to close identified gaps. In addition, we are actively creating employee resource groups, which are designed to facilitate more social and community interaction in our workforce, to foster a more inclusive culture. 
Our Associates
Our associates are the foundation of our business. BlueLinx has an entrepreneurial and high-performance culture where associates are expected to live by our core values of teamwork, continuous improvement and integrity each and every day. As of January 1, 2022, we employed approximately 2,055 associates, and less than one percent of our associates are employed on a part-time basis. Approximately 21 percent of our associates were represented by various local labor unions with terms and conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) negotiated between the Company and the local unions. Six CBAs covering approximately six percent of our associates were up for renewal in fiscal 2021. Four of those CBAs were successfully renewed, and another is expected to be completed before the end of the first quarter 2022. The remaining 
CBA was terminated as a result of the local union disclaiming interest in continuing to represent the associates at the particular location. Two CBAs covering approximately four percent of our associates are up for renewal in fiscal 2022.
We strongly believe that our corporate culture depends on our associates’ engagement and understanding of their contribution to the achievement of our strategic imperatives, vision, and mission. We also seek to connect our leaders across regions and provide them with opportunities to enable collaboration and to connect with the larger organization. In addition to prioritizing regular communications, we are conducting regular employee surveys to monitor our culture and employee engagement, while seeking feedback on what is going well and where we can focus our efforts to do more. Our annual company survey had participation from approximately 72 percent of our associates in fiscal 2021, representing a wide cross section of our associate population.
We also conduct periodic leadership town halls where associates are invited to engage with senior leadership. Our CEO and other executives engage directly with associates by visiting branches and participating in team and other meetings. 
During fiscal 2021, we continued to invest in our people, and in programs and systems designed to meet the increased demand for talent in a dynamic marketplace. For instance, we are increasing our investments in our benefits programs, which included approving expanded medical coverage for infertility, and new adoption assistance and loan repayment assistance benefits for 2022. Also, since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have actively promoted and encouraged the use of our mental health benefits, which include certain free in-person mental health visits and unlimited online mental health sessions. We also launched quarterly talent reviews to further our succession planning and career development objectives. 
As a part of our investment in the company’s associates, in December 2021 and in recognition of our performance and the contribution of our associates, we announced that all eligible hourly and salaried employees would receive a discretionary year-end bonus consisting of a combination of cash and/or time-based restricted stock units with a one year vesting period.
Safety
We are committed to fostering a safe working environment for our associates. In addition to implementing COVID-19 protocols during the pandemic, we have established uniform safety and compliance procedures for our operations, and implemented measures designed to prevent workplace injuries. Our safety programs focus on job hazard identification and prevention, coupled with extensive on-going job-specific training. For example, material handlers and Department of Transportation (“DOT”)-registered drivers follow a monthly individualized training curriculum, with knowledge testing, for injury and accident prevention. In addition, depending on the nature and requirements of their role, new hires and contract employees undergo safety training during their initial onboarding. We also administer post injury/accident corrective action supplemental training as needed and dictated by our investigations. To help prevent future occurrences, accidents and injuries are investigated with corrective actions implemented locally and communicated to key operations personnel across the enterprise. To enhance the safety of our fleet, we are making a significant investment in “curtainside” trailers that cover and enclose the materials inside. Our newest tractors are equipped with collision avoidance systems, blind spot detection and lane departure warning technology, and our newest tractors and trailers are equipped with disc-type brakes to improve stopping distance and driver control.
Seasonality
We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors common in the building products distribution industry. The first and fourth quarters are typically our lower volume quarters due to the impact of unfavorable weather on the construction market. Our second and third quarters are typically our higher volume quarters, reflecting an increase in construction, due to more favorable weather conditions. In past years, assuming no change in underlying inventory costs, our working capital has increased in the second and third quarters, reflecting general increases in seasonal demand. 
During the ongoing novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, our typical patterns of seasonality changed, largely due to increased demand for our products. Milder weather in the latter part of 2021 also contributed to our traditional summer patterns continuing into the fourth quarter. While uncertain, it remains a possibility that changes to our typical seasonality trends could continue during fiscal 2022 should similar market conditions continue. 
Climate Change 
Climate change presents potential risks and uncertainties for us. Weather-related events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or extreme temperature changes, can impact our operations and result in lost production, supply chain disruptions and increased 
material costs. In addition, the availability and price of the products we buy and sell may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, fires or other unpredictable weather events. While unpredictable weather and other changes in climate can have a negative impact on our business, changes in climate also could result in more accommodating weather patterns for longer periods of time in certain areas. Extended periods of favorable weather can result in an increase in construction, and a corresponding increase in the demand for our products. In addition, our operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change. To the extent that climate-related risks materialize, and if we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, which could have a material effect on our financial results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risks posed by climate change.
Sustainability
In addition to participating in the Forestry Stewardship Council, an organization promoting environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world’s forests, we are purchasing electric forklifts to use in certain locations. We also are focused on utilizing more fuel-efficient vehicles in our fleet, replacing our warehouse lighting systems with more environmentally friendly lighting solutions, and reducing our landfill waste by prioritizing recycling options, where available.
Competition 
The U.S. building products distribution market is a highly fragmented market, served by national and multi-regional distributors, regionally focused distributors, and independent local distributors. Local and regional distributors tend to be closely held and often specialize in a limited number of product segments, in which they may offer a broader selection of products. Some of our national and multi-regional competitors are part of larger companies and, therefore, may have access to greater financial and other resources than those to which we have access. We compete on the basis of breadth of product offering, consistent availability of product, product price and quality, reputation, service, and distribution facility location. 
Three of our largest competitors are Boise Cascade Company, Weyerhaeuser Company, and Specialty Building Products. Most major markets in which we operate are served by the distribution arm of at least one of these companies.
Governmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various federal, state, provincial, and local laws, rules, and regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). In order to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA requirements, we have established uniform safety and compliance procedures for our operations, and implemented measures designed to prevent workplace injuries. Our safety programs focus on job hazard identification and prevention, coupled with extensive on-going job-specific training. For example, material handlers and DOT-registered drivers follow a monthly individualized training curriculum, with knowledge testing, for injury and accident prevention. In addition, new hires and contract employees undergo safety training during their initial onboarding. We also administer post injury/accident corrective action supplemental training as needed and dictated by our investigations. To help prevent future occurrences, accidents and injuries are investigated with corrective actions implemented locally and communicated to key operations personnel across the enterprise. To enhance the safety of our fleet, we are making a significant investment in “curtainside” trailers that cover and enclose the materials inside. Our newest tractors are equipped with collision avoidance systems, blind spot detection and lane departure warning technology, and our newest tractors and trailers are equipped with disc-type brakes to improve stopping distance and driver control.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulates our operations in domestic interstate commerce. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. We are also subject to the oversight of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”). Additionally, among other things, vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service are subject to both federal and state regulation. Through a partnership with their local DOT enforcement agencies, our branches continue to host DOT troopers to conduct training walk-around inspections of our equipment to supplement our internal driver training efforts. The Troopers cover all dimensions DOT compliance with specific focus on vehicle maintenance and load securement safety requirements. 
We also are subject to environmental laws, rules, and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws, ordinances, and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Many of them provide for substantial fines and penalties, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, certain 
of our operations require us to obtain, maintain compliance with, and periodically renew, environmental permits. We are proactively replacing our diesel underground storage tanks based on their age to prevent fuel releases to the environment.
Certain of these environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), may require the investigation and cleanup of an entity’s or its predecessor’s current or former properties, even if the associated contamination was caused by the operations of a third party. These laws also may require the investigation and cleanup of third-party sites at which an entity or its predecessor sent hazardous wastes for disposal, notwithstanding that the original disposal activity accorded with applicable requirements. Liability under such laws may be imposed jointly and severally, and regardless of fault. In addition, our operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change.
We have incurred and will continue to incur costs to comply with the requirements of health and safety, transportation, and environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. These requirements could become more stringent in the future, and we cannot make assurances that compliance costs may not become material.
Significant Recent Transactions and Developments
Term Loan Facility
As of January 2, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings of $43.2 million under our senior secured term loan facility. On April 2, 2021, we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance under the facility and the facility was terminated. As a result, as of January 1, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility. In connection with our repayment of the facility, we expensed $5.8 million of debt issuance costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 that we had been amortizing in connection with the facility. These costs are included within interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and reported separately as an adjustment to net income in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. While the facility was paid in full as of April 2, 2021, our average interest rate under the facility, exclusive of fees and prepayment premiums, was 8.2 percent and 8.0 percent for the years ended January 2, 2021 and January 1, 2022, respectively. 
Amendment of our Revolving Credit Facility
On August 2, 2021, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the facility from October 10, 2022, to August 2, 2026, (ii) amend the Borrowing Base (as such term is defined under the facility) to include a certain portion of the assets of acquired companies prior to the conduct of a field exam or appraisals thereof by the agent, (iii) modify certain definitions and various affirmative and negative covenants to provide additional flexibility for the Company, and (iv) add customary LIBOR replacement language.
In addition, the amended revolving credit facility now provides for interest on borrowings at a rate per annum equal to (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.25 percent to 1.75 percent, with the amount of such margin determined based upon the average of our excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as calculated by the agent, for loans based on LIBOR, or (ii) the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.75 percent, with the amount of such margin determined based upon the average of our excess availability for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as calculated by the agent, for loans based on the base rate, reflecting a decrease of 0.50 percent to the upper limit of each respective margin tier.
As of January 1, 2022, we had zero outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. 
Share Repurchase Program
On August 23, 2021, we announced our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $25 million of our common stock. Under the program, we may repurchase our common stock at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations. Our repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to a trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. As of the date of this filing, we have repurchased no shares under this program.
Senior Secured Notes Transaction
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed a private offering of $300 million of our six percent senior secured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes were issued to investors at 98.625 percent of their principal amount and will mature 
on November 15, 2029. The majority of net proceeds from the offering of the 2029 Notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In conjunction with this offering, we also amended the revolving credit facility to reduce the credit limit from $600 million to $350 million. In conjunction with the reduction of the credit limit of our revolving credit facility, we expensed approximately $1.6 million of debt issuance costs during the fourth quarter of 2021. These costs are included within interest expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and reported separately as an adjustment to net income in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Real Estate Transactions
During fiscal 2021, we sold two non-operating facilities that were previously identified as “held for sale”. During the first quarter, we sold our non-operating facility located in Birmingham, Alabama, and recognized a gain of $1.3 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income, as a result of this sale. Proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down our term loan facility. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we sold our non-operating facility located in Houston, Texas. We recognized a gain of $7.1 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income as a result of this sale.
