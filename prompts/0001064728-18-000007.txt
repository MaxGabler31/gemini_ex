Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are the world’s largest private-sector coal company by volume. We own interests in 23 coal mining operations located in the United States (U.S.) and Australia. We have a majority interest in 22 of those mining operations and a 50% equity interest in Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd. (Middlemount), which owns the Middlemount Mine in Queensland, Australia. In addition to our mining operations, we market and broker coal from other coal producers, both as principal and agent, and trade coal and freight-related contracts through trading and business offices in the U.S., Australia, China, and the United Kingdom. In 2017, we achieved a global safety incidence rate of 1.38 incidents per 200,000 hours worked, which was a 26% improvement in our global safety performance over the past five years. We were also recognized by the U.S. National Mining Association as the first in the industry to achieve independent certification under the CORESafety® system.
Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
On April 13, 2016 (the Petition Date), Peabody Energy Corporation and a majority of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries as well as one international subsidiary in Gibraltar (the Filing Subsidiaries, and together with Peabody, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the Bankruptcy Petitions) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the Bankruptcy Court). The Company’s Australian operations and other international subsidiaries were not included in the filings. The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases (collectively, the Chapter 11 Cases) were jointly administered under the caption In re Peabody Energy Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-42529 (Bankr. E.D. Mo.). During the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors continued to operate their business as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors were authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but could not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
On January 27, 2017, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession (as further modified, the Plan) and the Second Amended Disclosure Statement with Respect to the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession (previous versions of the Plan and Disclosure Statement were filed with the Bankruptcy Court on December 22, 2016 and January 25, 2017). Subsequently, the Debtors solicited votes on the Plan. On March 15, 2017, the Debtors filed a revised version of the Plan and on March 16, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing to determine whether the Plan should be confirmed. On March 17, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 2763 (the Confirmation Order), confirming the Plan. On April 3, 2017 (the Effective Date), the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness set forth in the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases.
A group of creditors (the Ad Hoc Committee) that held certain interests in the Company's prepetition indebtedness appealed the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming the Plan.  On December 29, 2017, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the District Court) entered an order dismissing the Ad Hoc Committee's appeal, and, in the alternative, affirming the order confirming the Plan. On January 26, 2018, the Ad Hoc Committee appealed the District Court's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (the Eighth Circuit). In its appeal, the Ad Hoc Committee does not ask the Eighth Circuit to reverse the order confirming the Plan. Instead, the Ad Hoc Committee asks the Eighth Circuit to award the Ad Hoc Committee members either unspecified damages or the right to buy an unspecified amount of Company stock at a discount. The Company does not believe the appeal is meritorious and will vigorously defend it.
Upon emergence, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 852, we applied fresh start reporting to our consolidated financial statements as of April 1, 2017 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes reflecting the Successor (as defined below) capital structure. As a new entity, a new accounting basis in the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed was established with no retained earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For additional details, refer to Note 1. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 2. “Emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and Fresh Start Reporting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 2

In connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and the adoption of fresh start reporting, the results of operations for 2017 separately present a Successor period (for the period April 2, 2017 through December 31, 2017) and a Predecessor period (for the period January 1, 2017 through April 1, 2017). The results of operations for the years ended 2016 and 2015 are presented as Predecessor periods. References to “Successor” are in reference to reporting dates on or after April 2, 2017; references to “Predecessor” are in reference to reporting dates through April 1, 2017, which include the impact of the Plan provisions and the application of fresh start reporting. Although the 2017 Successor period and the 2017 Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of emergence and fresh start reporting did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted herein. Accordingly, references to 2017 results of operations for year ended December 31, 2017 combine the two periods to enhance the comparability of such information to the prior year.
Segment and Geographic Information
We conduct business through six operating segments: Powder River Basin Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Metallurgical Mining, Australian Thermal Mining and Trading and Brokerage. Segment and geographic financial information is contained in Note 27. “Segment and Geographic Information” to our consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.
Mining Segments
The maps that follow display our active mine locations as of December 31, 2017. Also shown are the primary ports that we use in Australia for coal exports and our corporate headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri.
U.S. Mining Operations - Powder River Basin, Midwestern, Western

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 3

The principal business of our mining segments in the U.S. is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities in the U.S. under long-term contracts, with a portion sold as international exports as conditions warrant. Our Powder River Basin Mining operations consist of our mines in Wyoming. The mines in that segment are characterized by surface mining extraction processes, coal with a lower sulfur content and Btu and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations include our Illinois and Indiana mining operations, which are characterized by a mix of surface and underground mining extraction processes, coal with a higher sulfur content and Btu, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Western U.S. Mining operations reflect the aggregation of our New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado mining operations. The mines in that segment are characterized by a mix of surface and underground mining extraction processes, coal with a mid-range sulfur content and Btu. Geologically, our Powder River Basin Mining operations mine sub-bituminous coal deposits, our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous coal deposits and our Western U.S. Mining operations mine both bituminous and sub-bituminous coal deposits.
As described more fully in Part I, Item 1 under the heading “Transportation”, coal consumed in the U.S. is usually sold at the mine with transportation costs borne by the purchaser. Our U.S. mine sites are typically adjacent to a rail loop; however in limited circumstances coal may be trucked to a barge site. Title predominately passes to the purchaser at the rail or barge, as applicable.
Our U.S. export coal is more typically sold on a delivered basis into the unloading port, and we pay ocean freight. In each case, exporters usually pay shipping costs from the mine to the port, including any demurrage costs (fees paid to third-party shipping companies for loading time that exceeded the stipulated time). The primary ports used for U.S. exports are the United Bulk Terminal near New Orleans, Louisiana, the St. James Stevedoring Anchorages terminal in Convent, Louisiana and the Kinder Morgan terminal near Houston, Texas.

Australian Mining Operations - Metallurgical, Thermal

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 5

The business of our Australian operating platform is primarily export focused with customers spread across several countries, while a portion of our metallurgical and thermal coal is sold within Australia. Generally, revenues from individual countries vary year by year based on electricity and steel demand, the strength of the global economy, governmental policies and several other factors, including those specific to each country. Our Australian Metallurgical Mining operations consist of mines in Queensland and one in New South Wales, Australia. The mines in that segment are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes used to mine various qualities of metallurgical coal (low-sulfur, high Btu coal). The metallurgical coal qualities include hard coking coal, semi-hard coking coal, semi-soft coking coal and low-volatile pulverized coal injection (LV PCI) coal. Our Australian Thermal Mining operations consist of mines in New South Wales, Australia. The mines in that segment are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes used to mine low-sulfur, high Btu thermal coal. We classify our Australian mines within the Australian Metallurgical Mining or Australian Thermal Mining segments based on the primary customer base and coal reserve type of each mining operation. A small portion of the coal mined by the Australian Metallurgical Mining segment is of a thermal grade. Similarly, a small portion of the coal mined by the Australian Thermal Mining segment is of a metallurgical grade. Additionally, we may market some of our metallurgical coal products as a thermal coal product from time to time depending on supply and demand conditions. 
As described more fully in Part I, Item 1 under the heading “Transportation”, our Australian export coal is usually sold at the loading port, with purchasers paying ocean freight. We have generally secured our ability to transport coal in Australia through rail and port contracts and interests in five east coast coal export terminals. In Queensland, seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal from our mines is exported through the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, in addition to the Abbot Point Coal Terminal used by our joint venture Middlemount Mine. In New South Wales, our primary ports for exporting metallurgical and thermal coal are at Port Kembla and Newcastle, which includes both the Port Waratah Coal Services terminal and the terminal operated by Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (NCIG).

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 7

Trading and Brokerage Segment
Our Trading and Brokerage segment engages in the direct and brokered trading of coal and freight-related contracts through our trading and business offices. Coal brokering is conducted both as principal and agent in support of various coal production-related activities that may involve coal produced from our mines, including optimization and blending of such coal, coal sourcing arrangements with third-party mining companies or offtake agreements with other coal producers. Our Trading and Brokerage segment also provides transportation-related services, which involve both financial derivative contracts and physical contracts. Collectively, coal and freight-related hedging activities include both economic hedging and, from time to time, cash flow hedging in support of our coal trading strategy. 
Corporate and Other Segment
Our Corporate and Other segment includes selling and administrative expenses, including our technical and shared services functions, corporate hedging activities, mining and export/transportation joint ventures, restructuring charges and activities associated with the optimization of our coal reserve and real estate holdings, minimum charges on certain transportation-related contracts, the closure of inactive mining sites and certain energy-related commercial matters.
Resource Management.  As of December 31, 2017, we controlled approximately 5.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and approximately 600,000 acres of surface property through ownership and lease agreements. We have an ongoing asset optimization program whereby our property management group regularly reviews these reserves and surface properties for opportunities to generate earnings and cash flow through the sale or exchange of non-strategic coal reserves and surface lands. These surface lands include acres where we have completed post-mining reclamation. In addition, we generate revenue through royalties from coal reserves and oil and gas rights leased to third parties and farm income from surface lands under third-party contracts.
Middlemount Mine.  We own a 50% equity interest in Middlemount, which owns the Middlemount Mine in Queensland, Australia. The mine predominantly produces semi-hard coking coal and LV PCI coal for sale into seaborne coal markets through rail and port capacity contracted through Abbot Point Coal Terminal, with future capacity also secured at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. Mining operations first commenced at the Middlemount Mine in late 2011. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the mine sold 4.2 million, 4.5 million and 4.2 million tons of coal, respectively (on a 100% basis).
Coal Supply Agreements
Customers.  Our coal supply agreements are primarily with electricity generators, industrial facilities and steel manufacturers. Most of our sales (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) are made under long-term coal supply agreements (those with initial terms of one year or longer and which often include price reopener and/or extension provisions). A smaller portion of our sales are made under contracts with terms of less than one year, including sales made on a spot basis. Sales under long-term coal supply agreements comprised approximately 83%, 86% and 88% of our worldwide sales from our mining operations (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A recent trend has been for our customers under long-term coal supply agreements to seek contracts of shorter duration.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived 27% of our total revenues from our five largest customers. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 21 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various times from 2018 to 2025. The contract contributing the greatest amount of annual revenue in 2017 was approximately $277 million, or approximately 5% of our 2017 total revenues, and is due to expire in 2019. 
Backlog.  Our sales backlog (excluding trading and brokerage transactions), which includes coal supply agreements subject to price reopener and/or extension provisions, was approximately 507 million and 587 million tons of coal as of January 1, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Contracts in backlog have remaining terms ranging from one to 12 years and represent approximately three years of production based on our 2017 production volume of 188.3 million tons. Approximately 69% of our backlog is expected to be filled beyond 2018. 

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 8

U.S. Mining Operations.  Revenues from our Powder River Basin Mining, Western U.S. Mining and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments, in aggregate, represented approximately 53%, 59% and 63% of our total revenue base for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective aggregate amounts of approximately 84%, 81% and 83% of our sales volumes from mining operations. We expect to continue selling a significant portion of our Powder River Basin Mining, Western U.S. Mining and Midwestern U.S. Mining segment coal production under long-term supply agreements, and customers of those segments continue to pursue long-term sales agreements in recognition of the importance of reliability, service and predictable coal prices to their operations. The terms of coal supply agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of those agreements vary significantly in many respects, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental constraints, extension options, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions. Our approach is to selectively renew, or enter into new, long-term supply agreements when we can do so at prices and terms and conditions we believe are favorable.
Australian Mining Operations.  Revenues from our Australian Metallurgical Mining and Australian Thermal Mining segments represented approximately 46%, 41% and 36% of our total revenue base for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective amounts of 16%, 19% and 17% of our sales volumes from mining operations. Our production is primarily sold into the seaborne metallurgical and thermal markets, with a majority of those sales executed through annual and multi-year international coal supply agreements that contain provisions requiring both parties to renegotiate pricing periodically. Industry commercial practice, and our typical practice, is to negotiate pricing for seaborne metallurgical coal contracts on a quarterly, spot or index basis and seaborne thermal coal contracts on an annual, spot or index basis. The portion of volume priced on a shorter-term basis and index linked basis has increased in recent years and represented 30% in 2017. 
Transportation
Methods of Distribution. Coal consumed in the U.S. is usually sold at the mine with transportation costs borne by the purchaser. Our Australian export coal is usually sold at the loading port, with purchasers paying ocean freight. Our U.S. export coal is more typically sold on a delivered basis into the unloading port, and we pay ocean freight. In each case, exporters usually pay shipping costs from the mine to the port, including any demurrage costs (fees paid to third-party shipping companies for loading time that exceeded the stipulated time). 
We believe we have good relationships with U.S. and Australian rail carriers and port and barge companies due, in part, to our modern coal-loading facilities and the experience of our transportation coordinators. Refer to the table in the foregoing “Mining Segments” section for a summary of transportation methods by mine.
Export Facilities. Our U.S. Mining operations exported approximately 1%, 0% and 0% of its annual tons sold for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary ports used for U.S. exports are the United Bulk Terminal near New Orleans, Louisiana, the St. James Stevedoring Anchorages terminal in Convent, Louisiana and the Kinder Morgan terminal near Houston, Texas. We periodically assess opportunities for access to West Coast port facilities that will allow us to export our Powder River Basin coal products to serve demand in the Asian region, should market conditions warrant. 
Our Australian Mining operations sold approximately 73%, 75% and 77% of its tons into the seaborne coal markets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have generally secured our ability to transport coal in Australia through rail and port contracts and interests in five east coast coal export terminals that are primarily funded through take-or-pay arrangements (refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on our take-or-pay obligations). In Queensland, seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal from our mines is exported through the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, in addition to the Abbot Point Coal Terminal used by our joint venture Middlemount Mine. In New South Wales, our primary ports for exporting metallurgical and thermal coal are at Port Kembla and Newcastle, which includes both the Port Waratah Coal Services terminal and the terminal operated by NCIG. 
Suppliers
Mining Supplies and Equipment. The principal goods we purchase in support of our mining activities are mining equipment and replacement parts, diesel fuel, ammonium-nitrate and emulsion-based explosives, off-the-road (OTR) tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. We have many well-established, strategic relationships with our key suppliers of goods and do not believe that we are overly dependent on any of our individual suppliers.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 9

There has been consolidation in the supplier base providing certain mining materials and equipment to the coal industry. This has limited the number of global sources for these items, such as surface and underground mining equipment. In situations where we have elected to concentrate a large portion of our purchases with one supplier in lieu of seeking other alternatives, it has been to take advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of purchases, benefit from long-term pricing for parts, ensure security of supply and/or allow for equipment fleet standardization. Supplier concentration related to our mining equipment also allows us to benefit from fleet standardization, which in turn improves asset utilization by facilitating the development of common maintenance practices across our global platform and enhancing our flexibility to move equipment between mines as necessary. 
Surface and underground mining equipment demand and lead times have begun to extend in recent periods due to recovering market conditions experienced across several extractive industry sectors. We do not expect this to impact our own near-term demand for such equipment as we extend the lives of existing equipment through improved maintenance practices and equipment rebuilds in order to defer the requirement for larger capital purchases. We continue to use our global leverage with major suppliers to ensure security of supply to meet the requirements of our active mines. 
Services. We also purchase services at our mine sites, including services related to maintenance for mining equipment, construction, temporary labor, use of explosives and various other requirements. We do not believe that we have undue operational or financial risk associated with our dependence on any individual service providers.
Competition
Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are highly competitive and influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to global economic conditions, the demand for electricity and steel, the cost of alternative fuels, the cost of electricity generation from alternative fuels, including wind, solar, oil, hydro, nuclear, natural gas and biomass, the impact of weather on heating and cooling demand and taxes and environmental regulations imposed by the U.S. and foreign governments.
Thermal Coal
Demand for our thermal coal products is impacted by economic conditions, demand for electricity, including the impact of energy efficient products, and the cost of electricity generation from coal and alternative fuels. Our products compete with producers of other forms of electric generation, including natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass, that provide an alternative to coal use. The use and price of thermal coal is heavily influenced by the availability and relative cost of alternative fuels and the generation of electricity utilizing alternative fuels, with customers focused on securing the lowest cost fuel supply in order to coordinate the most efficient utilization of generating resources in the economic dispatch of the power grid at the most competitive price. 
In the U.S., natural gas is highly competitive (along with other alternative fuel sources) with thermal coal for electricity generation. The competitiveness of natural gas has been strengthened by accelerated growth in domestic natural gas production and transmission facilities over the last five years and comparatively low natural gas prices (versus historic levels). Gas prices averaged $3.02 per mmBtu in 2017, versus $2.55, $2.63 and $4.26 per mmBtu in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Natural gas price trends can significantly impact U.S. coal burn and production. We believe the U.S. Powder River and Illinois basins in which we produce are competitive against natural gas when natural gas prices average in excess of $2.50 to $2.75 per mmBtu and $3.00 to $3.50 per mmBtu, respectively. In addition, the competitiveness of other alternative fuel sources for electricity generation with coal has been strengthened by the growth of low-cost and government subsidized generation fueled by other alternative fuel sources.
Internationally, thermal coal also competes with alternative forms of electric generation. The competitiveness and availability of natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass varies by country and region. In addition, seaborne thermal coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in the two leading coal import countries, China and India, among others, and the competitiveness of seaborne supply from leading thermal coal exporting countries, including Indonesia, Australia, Russia, Colombia and South Africa, among others. 
In addition to our alternative fuel source competitors, our principal U.S. direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) are other large coal producers, including Alliance Resource Partners, Arch Coal, Inc., Cloud Peak Energy Inc., Contura Energy Inc., Murray Energy Corporation and Westmoreland Coal Company, which collectively accounted for approximately 43% of total U.S. coal production in 2016 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s “Annual Coal Report 2016,” the most recent data publicly available as of November 15, 2017. Major international direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) include Anglo-American PLC, BHP Billiton, China Coal, Coal India Limited, Glencore PLC, PT Bumi Resources Tbk., Rio Tinto, Shenhua Group and Yancoal Australia Ltd, among others.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 10

Metallurgical Coal 
Demand for our metallurgical coal products is impacted by economic conditions, demand for steel and competing technologies used to make steel, some of which do not use coal as a manufacturing input. We compete on the basis of coal quality and characteristics, delivered energy cost (including transportation costs), customer service and support and reliability of supply. 
Seaborne metallurgical coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in leading metallurgical coal import countries of China, India, Japan, South Korea and Brazil, among others, and the competitiveness of seaborne metallurgical coal supply, including from leading metallurgical coal exporting countries of Australia, U.S., Russia, Canada and Mongolia, among others. 
Major international direct competitors (listed alphabetically) include Anglo-American PLC, BHP Billiton, China Coal, Glencore PLC, PT Bumi Resources Tbk., Rio Tinto and Shenhua Group, among others.
Working Capital
We generally fund our working capital requirements through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers and our trading and brokerage activities. Our current accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility are also available to fund our working capital requirements to the extent we have remaining availability. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding working capital.
Employees 
We had approximately 7,100 employees as of December 31, 2017, including approximately 5,500 hourly employees. Additional information on our employees and related labor relations matters is contained in Note 23. “Management - Labor Relations” to our consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Regulatory Matters — U.S.
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, the reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining has been completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the industry is affected by significant requirements mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners. Numerous federal, state and local governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We believe that we have obtained all permits currently required to conduct our present mining operations.
We endeavor to conduct our mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time in the industry. 
Mine Safety and Health 
We are subject to health and safety standards both at the federal and state level. The regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters.
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is the entity responsible for monitoring compliance with the federal mine health and safety standards. MSHA employs various enforcement measures for noncompliance, including the issuance of monetary penalties and orders of withdrawal from a mine or part of a mine.
In Part I, Item 4. “Mine Safety Disclosures” and in Exhibit 95 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide additional details on MSHA compliance, through the mine safety disclosures required by SEC regulations.
Black Lung (Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis)
Under the U.S. Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each U.S. coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants who are current and former employees who last worked for the operator after July 1, 1973, and whose claims for benefits are allowed. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. Historically, very few of the miners who sought federal black lung benefits were awarded these benefits; however, the approval rate has increased following implementation of black lung provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations place substantial requirements on our coal mining operations, and require regular inspection and monitoring of our mines and other facilities to ensure compliance. We are also affected by various other federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations that impact our customers. 

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 13

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In the U.S., the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), which is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), established mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining and many aspects of underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSMRE. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority, with oversight from OSMRE. Except for Arizona, states in which we have active mining operations have achieved primary control of enforcement through federal authorization. In Arizona, we mine on tribal lands and are regulated by the OSMRE because the tribes do not have SMCRA authorization.
SMCRA provides for three categories of bonds: surety bonds, collateral bonds and self-bonds. A surety bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain payable to the regulatory authority, executed by the permittee as principal and which is supported by the performance guarantee of a surety corporation. A collateral bond can take several forms, including cash, letters of credit, first lien security interest in property or other qualifying investment securities. A self-bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain executed by the permittee or by the permittee and any corporate guarantor made payable to the regulatory authority.
Our total reclamation bonding requirements in the U.S. were $1,249.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The bond requirements for a mine represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceased to operate in the current period. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state. Our asset retirement obligations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for our U.S. operations were $457.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The bond requirement amount for our U.S. operations significantly exceeds the financial liability for final mine reclamation because the asset retirement obligation liability is discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition that the final reclamation cash outlay is a number of years (and in some cases decades) away. The bond amount, in contrast with the asset retirement obligation, presumes reclamation begins immediately.
After a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including public hearings and through intervention in the courts. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the performance of reclamation bonding requirements.
In situations where our coal resources are federally owned, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management oversees a substantive exploration and leasing process. If surface land is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, that agency serves as the cooperating agency during the federal coal leasing process. Federal coal leases also require an approved federal mining permit under the signature of the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
The SMCRA Abandoned Mine Land Fund requires a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. The proceeds are used to rehabilitate lands mined and left unreclaimed prior to August 3, 1977 and to pay health care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The fee amount can change periodically based on changes in federal legislation. Pursuant to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, from October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2012, the fee was $0.315 and $0.135 per ton of surface-mined and underground-mined coal, respectively. From October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee is $0.28 and $0.12 per ton of surface-mined and underground-mined coal, respectively. We recognized expense related to the fees of $31.6 million for the Successor period April 2 through December 31, 2017 and $10.3 million, $38.7 million and $47.0 million for the Predecessor period January 1 through April 1, 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA, enacted in 1970, and comparable state and tribal laws that regulate air emissions affect our U.S. coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. 
Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations may occur through the CAA permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In recent years the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted more stringent national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM, nitrogen oxide, ozone and SO2. It is possible that these modifications as well as future modifications to NAAQS could directly or indirectly impact our mining operations in a manner that includes, but is not limited to, designating new nonattainment areas or expanding existing nonattainment areas, serving as a basis for changes in vehicle emission standards or prompting additional local control measures pursuant to state implementation plans required to address revised NAAQS.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 14

In 2009, the EPA adopted revised rules to add more stringent PM emissions limits for coal preparation and processing plants constructed or modified after April 28, 2008. The PM NAAQS was thereafter revised and made more stringent in 2012. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule setting the ozone NAAQS at 70 parts per billion (ppb). (80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, (Oct. 25, 2015)). This final rule has been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit), however, the case has been held in abeyance pending the EPA’s review of the final rule. More stringent ozone standards would require new state implementation plans to be developed and filed with the EPA and may trigger additional control technology for mining equipment, or result in additional challenges to permitting and expansion efforts. This could also be the case with respect to the implementation for other NAAQS for nitrogen oxide and SO2. 
The CAA also indirectly, but significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of SO2, nitrogen oxides, mercury, PM and other substances emitted by coal-fueled electricity generating plants, imposing more capital and operating costs on such facilities. In addition, other CAA programs may require further emission reductions to address the interstate transport of air pollution or regional haze. The air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the Acid Rain Program, interstate transport rules such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the CSAPR Update Rule, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) emissions limits for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the Regional Haze program and source permitting programs, including requirements related to New Source Review.
In addition, since 2011, the EPA has required underground coal mines to report on their greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations regarding reporting requirements for underground coal mines were updated in 2016 and now include the ability to cease reporting if mines are abandoned and sealed. At present, however, the EPA does not directly regulate such emissions.
Final NSPS for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electricity Utility Generating Units (EGUs). The EPA promulgated a final rule to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) from new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs under section 111(b) of the CAA on August 3, 2015, and published it in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015.
This rule requires that newly-constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units achieve an emission standard for carbon dioxide of 1,400 lb carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour gross output (CO2/MWh-gross). The standard is based on the performance of a supercritical pulverized coal boiler implementing partial carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units must implement the most efficient generation achievable through a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades, to meet an emission standard consistent with best historical performance. Reconstructed units must implement the most efficient generating technology based on the size of the unit (supercritical steam conditions for larger units, to meet a standard of 1,800 lb CO2/MWh-gross, and subcritical conditions for smaller units to meet a standard of 2,000 lb CO2/MWh-gross.).
Numerous legal challenges to the final rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit. Sixteen separate petitions for review were filed, and the challengers include 25 states, utilities, mining companies (including Peabody Energy), labor unions, trade organizations and other groups. The cases were consolidated under the case filed by North Dakota (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381). Four additional cases were filed seeking review of the EPA’s denial of reconsideration petitions in a final action published in the May 6, 2016 Federal Register entitled “Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units; Notice of final action denying petitions for reconsideration.” Pursuant to an order of the court, these cases remain in abeyance, subject to requirements for the EPA to file 90-day status reports. Thus, the NSPS remains in effect.
Final Rule Regulating Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired EGUs. On October 23, 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register regulating CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs under section 111(d) of the CAA (80 Fed. Reg. 64,662 (Oct. 23, 2015)). The rule (known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP)) establishes emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. These final guidelines require that the states individually or collectively create systems that would reduce carbon emissions from any EGU located within their borders by 28% in 2025 and 32% in 2030 (compared with a 2005 baseline).  
Following Federal Register publication, 39 separate petitions for review of the CPP by approximately 157 entities were filed in the D.C. Circuit. The petitions reflect challenges by 27 states and governmental entities, as well as challenges by utilities, industry groups, trade associations, coal companies, and other entities. The lawsuits were consolidated with the case filed by West Virginia and Texas (in which other states have also joined). (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1363). On October 29, 2015, we filed a motion to intervene in the case filed by West Virginia and Texas, in support of the petitioning states. The motion was granted on January 11, 2016. Numerous states and cities have also been allowed to intervene in support of the EPA.
On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court granted a motion to stay implementation of the CPP until its legal challenges are resolved. Thereafter, oral arguments in the case were heard in the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc by ten active D.C. Circuit judges, but to date, the D.C. Circuit has not issued an opinion. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion by the EPA to hold the case in abeyance while the Agency reconsidered the rule.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 15

In October 2017, the EPA proposed to change its legal interpretation of CAA section 111(d), the authority that the Agency relied on for the 2015 CPP. (82 Fed. Reg. 48,035 (Oct. 16, 2017)). The EPA will accept public comments through April 26, 2018. If this proposed reinterpretation is finalized by the EPA, the CPP would be repealed. The EPA has also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit information concerning a potential new rule for emission guidelines for existing EGUs pursuant to CAA section 111(d). 82 Fed. Reg. 61,508 (Dec. 28, 2017).
EPA’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Permitting Regulations for Major Emission Sources. In May 2010, the EPA published final rules requiring permitting and control technology requirements for GHGs under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting programs that apply to stationary sources of air pollution. The EPA determined that these requirements were “triggered” by the EPA’s prior regulation of GHGs from motor vehicles.These rules were subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit on June 26, 2012. On June 23, 2014, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not require PSD and Title V permitting for GHGs emitted from stationary sources if those sources were not otherwise considered to be “major sources” of conventional pollutants for purposes of PSD and Title V. Affected sources are required to employ the best available control technology for GHGs as determined by the governmental entity that issues the permit (most often a state environmental agency).
Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and CSAPR Update Rule. On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the CSAPR, which requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Following litigation in the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and SO2 emissions reductions required by CSAPR commenced in January 2015; further reductions of both pollutants in the second phase of CSAPR became effective in January 2017. The EPA subsequently revised CSAPR requirements for the state of Texas to remove that state from second phase requirements regarding SO2 (82 Fed. Reg. 45,481 (Sept. 29, 2017)).
On October 26, 2016, the EPA promulgated the CSAPR Update Rule to address implementation of the 2008 ozone national air quality standards. This rule imposed further reductions in nitrogen oxides in 2017 in 22 states subject to CSAPR. Several states and utilities as well as agricultural and industry groups utilities have filed petitions for review of the CSAPR Update Rule in the D.C. Circuit. Other states and interest groups have filed to intervene on behalf of the EPA. These petitions have been consolidated under D.C. Cir. No. 16-1406.
Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS). The EPA published the final MATS rule in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The MATS rule revised the NSPS for nitrogen oxides, SO2 and PM for new and modified coal-fueled electricity generating plants, and imposed MACT emission limits on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electric generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, acid gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP metals and organic HAPs. The rule provided three years for compliance with MACT standards and a possible fourth year if a state permitting agency determined that such was necessary for the installation of controls.
Following issuance of the final rule, numerous petitions for review were filed. The D.C. Circuit upheld the NSPS portion of the rulemaking in a unanimous decision on March 11, 2014, and upheld the limits on HAPs against all challenges on April 15, 2014, in a two-to-one decision. Industry groups and a number of states filed and were granted review of the D.C. Circuit decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA interpreted the CAA unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate HAPs from power plants. The court reversed the D.C. Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 1, 2015, in response to the court’s decision the EPA published a proposed supplemental finding in the Federal Register that consideration of costs does not alter the EPA’s previous determination regarding the control of HAPs in the MATS rule. On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Circuit issued an order providing that the rule will remain in effect while the EPA responds to the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
On April 14, 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding that largely tracked its proposed finding. Several states, companies and industry groups challenged that supplemental finding in the D.C. Circuit in separate petitions for review, which were subsequently consolidated. D.C. Cir. No. 116-1127. Several states and environmental groups also filed as intervenors for the respondent EPA. Although briefing in this litigation has concluded, the case remains in abeyance while the EPA reviews the supplemental finding to determine whether the rule should be maintained, modified, or otherwise reconsidered.
Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. President Trump’s Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (EI Order) signed on March 28, 2017, lifted the Department of Interior’s federal coal leasing moratorium and rescinded guidance on the inclusion of social cost of carbon in federal rulemaking. Following the EI Order, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3349 ending the federal coal leasing moratorium. 

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 16

Stream Protection Rule.  On July 27, 2015, the OSMRE issued its proposed Stream Protection Rule (SPR). The proposed rule would have impacted both surface and underground mining operations and would have increased testing and monitoring requirements related to the quality or quantity of surface water and groundwater or the biological condition of streams. The SPR would have also required the collection of increased pre-mining data about the site of the proposed mining operation and adjacent areas to establish a baseline for evaluation of the impacts of mining and the effectiveness of reclamation associated with returning streams to pre-mining conditions. Both chambers of Congress have already passed legislation to repeal and invalidate the rulemaking, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. The House passed H.J. Res. 38 on February 1, 2017 and the Senate passed the bill the next day. On February 16, 2017, President Trump signed H.J. Res. 38, resulting in the repeal of the SPR and preventing the OSMRE from promulgating any substantially similar rule.
Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA of 1972 directly impacts U.S. coal mining operations by requiring effluent limitations and treatment standards for wastewater discharge from mines through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Regular monitoring, reporting and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of water from mine-related point sources into receiving waters. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates certain activities affecting navigable waters and waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Section 404 of the CWA requires mining companies to obtain Corps permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities.
States are empowered to develop and apply “in stream” water quality standards. These standards are subject to change and must be approved by the EPA. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. “In stream” standards vary from state to state. Additionally, through the CWA section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. States consider whether the activity will comply with their water quality standards and other applicable requirements in deciding whether or not to certify the activity.
A final rule defining the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act (commonly called the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Rule) was published by the EPA and the Corps in June 2015, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the rule nationwide since October 9, 2015. Numerous lawsuits challenging the 2015 WOTUS Rule remain pending at this time, though all litigation has been stayed, while the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the Sixth Circuit (where all challenges that were filed in the courts of appeals were consolidated) has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the rule or whether challenges must begin in district courts. On January 22, 2018, the Supreme Court held that challenges to the WOTUS Rule must begin in the district courts, and ordered the Sixth Circuit to dismiss the challenges pending before it. As a result of the Supreme Court’s ruling, litigation on the merits of the 2015 WOTUS Rule will likely resume in one or more district courts. On February 28, 2017 the Trump Administration released an Executive Order directing the EPA and the Corps to consider rescinding or revising the WOTUS Rule, and the EPA and the Corps issued a similar notice that same day. The EPA and the Corps are in the process of repealing the 2015 WOTUS Rule and developing a replacement rule. The agencies have proposed, but not yet finalized, a repeal action, and they plan to propose a replacement rule in mid-2018. The agencies also recently revised the 2015 WOTUS Rule by postponing its application until February 6, 2020. Several states and environmental groups immediately challenged this action, but for the time being, the pre-2015 definitions of WOTUS remain in effect nationwide. If CWA authority is eventually expanded, it may impact our operations in some areas by way of additional requirements. 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA, signed into law in 1970, requires federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of their decisions and issue either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. We must provide information to agencies when we propose actions that will be under the authority of the federal government. The NEPA process involves public participation and can involve lengthy timeframes. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA, which was enacted in 1976, affects U.S. coal mining operations by establishing “cradle to grave” requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Typically, the only hazardous wastes generated at a mine site are those from products used in vehicles and for machinery maintenance. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, are not considered hazardous wastes under RCRA.
Subtitle C of RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the final rule on coal combustion residuals (CCR or coal ash). As finalized, the rule continues the exemption of CCR from regulation as a hazardous waste, but does impose new requirements at existing CCR surface impoundments and landfills that will need to be implemented over a number of different time-frames in the coming months and years, as well as at new surface impoundments and landfills. Generally these requirements will increase the cost of CCR management, but not as much as if the rule had regulated CCR as hazardous. This EPA initiative is separate from the OSMRE CCR rulemaking mentioned above.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2017 Form 10-K | 17

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Although generally not a prominent environmental law in the coal mining sector, CERCLA, which was enacted in 1980, nonetheless may affect U.S. coal mining operations by creating liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Under CERCLA, joint and several liabilities may be imposed on waste generators, site owners or operators and others, regardless of fault.
Toxic Release Inventory. Arising out of the passage of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in 1986 and the Pollution Prevention Act passed in 1990, the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory program requires companies to report the use, manufacture or processing of listed toxic materials that exceed established thresholds, including chemicals used in equipment maintenance, reclamation, water treatment and ash received for mine placement from power generation customers.
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA of 1973 and counterpart state legislation is intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. Changes in listings or requirements under these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our costs or our ability to mine some of our properties in accordance with our current mining plans. 
Use of Explosives. Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Pursuant to these regulations, we incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. The storage of explosives is subject to strict federal regulatory requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) regulates the use of explosive blasting materials. In addition to ATF regulation, the Department of Homeland Security is expected to finalize an ammonium nitrate security program rule. The OSMRE has also initiated a rulemaking addressing nitrous clouds that may be produced during blasting. While such new regulations may result in additional costs related to our surface mining operations, such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
OSMRE Self-Bonding Notice of Rulemaking. On August 16, 2016, the OSMRE announced a decision to initiate a rulemaking process to update the OSMRE’s bonding regulations. The decision stated that the OSMRE will be reviewing the self-bonding program and will consider revising the review process for determining if a company qualifies for self-bonding as well as the process for replacing self-bonds in the event a company no longer qualifies for self-bonding. There is no anticipated timing for the proposed rule and the new Director of OSMRE has not indicated he will continue with the proposed rulemaking.
Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule. On October 10, 2017, the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled the Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule (the Proposed Rule). The Proposed Rule was issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. 42 U.S.C. § 7173. In the Proposed Rule, the Secretary instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose rules to ensure that reliability and resiliency attributes of certain electric generation units with a 90-day on-site fuel supply are fully compensated for the benefits and services they provide to grid operations. The Secretary directed FERC to take final action on the Proposed Rule within 60 days of publication or, in the alternative, to issue the rule as an interim final rule immediately, with provision for later modifications after consideration of public comments. The Proposed Rule cites the retirements of coal and nuclear plants as a potential threat to grid reliability and resilience, and provides for the creation of a “reliability and resiliency rate” that would compensate certain eligible resources for the benefits and services they provide to grid operations, allowing such eligible resources to recover their fully allocated costs and a fair return on equity. The “reliability and resiliency rate” would be available to eligible resources operating within FERC-approved independent system operators or regional transmission organizations with energy and capacity markets. The rate would apply only to generators that are not currently subject to cost-of-service regulation by a state or other authority. On January 8, 2018, FERC unanimously denied the petition and requested additional information from power grid operators thus putting off any new rulemaking by at least two months, dismissing the Secretary's call to act immediately. FERC  has opened  a new proceeding to "take additional steps to explore resilience issues in the [regional transmission organizations and independent system operators]." That docket will aim to develop an understanding of what resilience actually means for the grid and to understand how each grid operator addresses the issue.
Regulatory Matters — Australia 
The Australian mining industry is regulated by Australian federal, state and local governments with respect to environmental issues such as land reclamation, water quality, air quality, dust control, noise, planning issues (such as approvals to expand existing mines or to develop new mines) and health and safety issues. The Australian federal government retains control over the level of foreign investment and export approvals. Industrial relations are regulated under both federal and state laws. Australian state governments also require coal companies to post deposits or give other security against land which is being used for mining, with those deposits being returned or security released after satisfactory reclamation is completed.

Native Title and Cultural Heritage.  Since 1992, the Australian courts have recognized that native title to lands, as recognized under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, may have survived the process of European settlement. These developments are supported by the Federal Native Title Act which recognizes and protects native title, and under which a national register of native title claims has been established. Native title rights do not extend to minerals; however, native title rights can be affected by the mining process unless those rights have previously been extinguished thereby requiring negotiation with the traditional owners (and potentially the payment of compensation) prior to the grant of certain mining tenements. There is also federal and state legislation to prevent damage to Aboriginal cultural heritage and archaeological sites.
Mining Tenements and Environmental.  In Queensland and New South Wales, the development of a mine requires both the grant of a right to extract the resource and an approval which authorizes the environmental impact. These approvals are obtained under separate legislation from separate government authorities. However, the application processes run concurrently and are also concurrent with any native title or cultural heritage process that is required. The environmental impacts of mining projects are regulated by state and federal governments. Federal regulation will only apply if the particular project will significantly impact a matter of national environmental significance (for example, a water resource, an endangered species or particular protected places). Environmental approvals processes involve complex issues that, on occasion, require lengthy studies and documentation. Typically mining proponents must also reach agreement with the owners of land underlying proposed mining tenements prior to the grant and/or conduct of mining activities or otherwise acquire the land. These arrangements generally involve the payment of compensation in lieu of the impacts of mining on the land.
Our Australian mining operations are generally subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations. At the federal level, these legislative acts include, but are not limited to, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, Native Title Act 1993, Fair Work Act 2009 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. 
In Queensland, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mineral Resources Act 1989, Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act), Environmental Protection Regulation 1998, Sustainable Planning Act 2009, Building Act 1975, Explosives Act 1999, Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003, Water Act 2000, State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971, Queensland Heritage Act 1992, Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, Nature Conservation Act 1992, Vegetation Management Act 1999, Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002, Land Act 1994, Regional Planning Interests Act 2014, Fisheries Act 1994 and Forestry Act 1959. Under the EP Act, policies have been developed to achieve the objectives of the law and provide guidance on specific areas of the environment, including air, noise, water and waste management. State planning policies address matters of Queensland State interest, and must be adhered to during mining project approvals. Increased emphasis has recently been placed on topics including, but not limited to, hazardous dams assessment and the protection of strategic cropping land. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 was amended effective September 27, 2016 to include significant changes to the management of overlapping coal and coal seam gas tenements and the coordination of activities and access to private and public land. In November 2016, amendments to the EP Act and the Water Act 2000 became effective and facilitate regulatory scrutiny of the environmental impacts of underground water extraction during the operational phase of resource projects for all tenements yet to commence mineral extraction. The ‘Chain of Responsibility’ provisions of the EP Act, effective in April 2016, allow the regulator to issue an environmental protection order (EPO) to a related person of a company in two circumstances; (a) if an EPO has been issued to the company, an EPO can also be issued to a related person of the company (at the same time or later); or (b) if the company is a high risk company (as defined in the EP Act), an EPO can be issued to a related person of the company (whether or not an EPO has also been issued to the company). A guideline has been issued to provide more certainty to the industry on the circumstances when an EPO may be issued.
In New South Wales, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mining Act 1992, Work Health and Safety (Mines) Act 2013, Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 1961, Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A Act), Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000, Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, Contaminated Land Management Act 1997, Explosives Act 2003, Water Management Act 2000, Water Act 1912, Radiation Control Act 1990, Heritage Act 1977, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983, Crown Lands Act 1989, Dangerous Goods (Road and Rail Transport) Act 2008, Fisheries Management Act 1994, Forestry Act 1916, Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994, Native Vegetation Act 2003, Noxious Weeds Act 1993, Roads Act 1993 and National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974. Under the EP&A Act, environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. There are multiple State Environmental Planning Policies (SEPPs) relevant to coal projects in New South Wales. Amendments to the SEPPs that cover mining have occurred in the past two years and are aimed at protecting agriculture, water resources and critical industry clusters. One SEPP, referred to as the Mining SEPP, was amended in late 2013 to make it mandatory for decision makers to consider the economic significance of coal resources when determining a development application for a mine and to give primacy to that consideration. This amendment was repealed in 2015. However, decision makers review the significance of a resource and the state and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the “public interest” consideration contained in the legislation.

Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation). Mine reclamation is regulated by state specific legislation. As a condition of approval for mining operations, companies are required to progressively reclaim mined land and provide appropriate bonding to the relevant state government as a safeguard to cover the costs of reclamation in circumstances where mine operators are unable to do so. Self-bonding is not permitted. Our mines provide financial assurance to the relevant authorities which is calculated in accordance with current regulatory requirements. This financial assurance is in the form of cash or bank guarantees which are supported by a combination of cash collateral and letters of credit drawn upon our credit facility and securitization program. We operate in both the Queensland and New South Wales state jurisdictions. 
Our reclamation bonding requirements in Australia were $281.3 million as of December 31, 2017. The bond requirements represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceased to operate in the current period less any discounts agreed with the state. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state. The costs associated with our Australian asset retirement obligations are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and were $233.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The total bonding requirements for our Australian operations differ from the calculated costs associated with the asset retirement obligations because the costs associated with asset retirement obligations are discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition of the economic reality that reclamation is conducted progressively and final reclamation is a number of years (and in some cases decades) away, whereas the bonding amount represents the cost of reclamation if a mine ceases to operate immediately.
New South Wales Reclamation. The Mining Act 1992 (Mining Act) is administered by the Department of Industry - Resources & Energy and authorizes the holder of a mining tenement to extract a mineral subject to obtaining consent under the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act 1979 and other auxiliary approvals and licenses. 
Through the Mining Act, environmental protection and reclamation are regulated by conditions in all mining leases including requirements for the submission of a Mining Operations Plan (MOP) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the MOP which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and reclamation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines publicly report their reclamation performance on an annual basis. 
In support of the MOP process, a reclamation cost estimate is calculated periodically to determine the amount of bond support required to cover the cost of reclamation based on extent of disturbance during the MOP period.
Queensland Reclamation. The Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act) is administered by the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection which authorizes environmentally relevant activities such as mining activities relating to a mining lease through an Environmental Authority (EA). Environmental protection and reclamation activities are regulated by conditions in the EA, including the requirement for the submission of a Plan of Operations (PO) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the PO which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines submit an annual return reporting on their EA compliance including reclamation performance.
As a condition of the EA, bonding requirements are calculated to determine the amount of bonding required to cover the cost of reclamation based on extent of disturbance during the PO period.
In May 2017, the Queensland government announced broad policy reform proposals in relation to financial assurance (FA) and rehabilitation for the mining and petroleum sector. The proposed regime represents a new approach to managing Queensland’s existing rehabilitation risks.
On October 25, 2017, the Queensland Parliament introduced the Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Bill 2017 (MERFP Bill), which contained proposed legislation to give effect to some of the policy reforms, including a remodeled FA framework that takes into account the financial strength of the FA holder and the risk level of the mine, a state-wide pooled FA fund covering most mines and most of the total industry liability, discontinuation of prior discounting of FA requirements, other options for providing FA for those mines that are not part of the pooled FA fund (for example, allowing insurance bonds or cash), updated rehabilitation calculations, and regular monitoring and reporting measures for progressive mine rehabilitation.
However, the MERFP Bill lapsed on October 29, 2017 when a Queensland state election was called. It is expected that the MERFP Bill, or a bill substantially similar thereto, will be reintroduced into Parliament in the near future.
Federal Reclamation.  In February 2017, the Australian Senate established a Committee of Inquiry into the rehabilitation of mining and resources projects as it relates to Commonwealth responsibilities, for example, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Committee is holding public hearings and is expected to issue a report during the second quarter of 2018.

Occupational Health and Safety.  State legislation requires us to provide and maintain a safe workplace by providing safe systems of work, safety equipment and appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision. In recognition of the specialized nature of mining and mining activities, specific occupational health and safety obligations have been mandated under state legislation specific to the coal mining industry. There are some differences in the application and detail of the laws, and mining operators, directors, officers and certain other employees are all subject to the obligations under this legislation.
A small number of coal mine workers in Queensland and New South Wales have been diagnosed with coal worker’s pneumoconiosis (CWP, also known as black lung) following decades of assumed eradication of the disease. This has led the Queensland government to sponsor review of the system of screening coal mine workers for the disease with a view to improving early detection. The Queensland government has instituted increased reporting requirements for dust monitoring results, broader coal mine worker health assessment requirements and voluntary retirement examinations for coal mine workers to be arranged by the relevant employer and further reform may follow. Peabody has undertaken a review of its practices and offered its Queensland workers the opportunity for additional CWP screening.
The Queensland government held a Parliamentary inquiry into the re-emergence of CWP in the State which included public hearings with appearances by representatives of the coal mining industry, including us, coal mine workers, the Department of Natural Resources and others. The Queensland Parliamentary Committee conducting the inquiry issued its final report on May 29, 2017. In finding that it is highly unlikely CWP was ever eradicated in Queensland, the Committee made 68 recommendations to ensure the safety and health of mine workers. These include an immediate reduction to the occupational exposure limit for respirable coal dust equivalent to 1.5mg/m3 for coal dust and 0.05 mg/m3 for silica and the establishment of a new and independent Mine Safety Authority to be funded by a dedicated proportion of coal and mineral royalties and overseeing the Mines Safety Inspectorate.
On August 23, 2017, the Queensland Parliament passed the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation (Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2017, which amends the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 by establishing a medical examination process for retired or former coal workers with suspected CWP, introducing an additional lump sum compensation for workers with CWP, and clarifying that a worker with CWP can access further workers’ compensation entitlements if they experience disease progression.
On August 24, 2017, the Queensland Parliamentary Committee released a report containing a draft of the Mine Safety and Health Authority Bill 2017, which proposes to establish the Mine Safety Authority foreshadowed in the Committee’s recommendations released in May 2017. The draft bill has been referred to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee for review.
On September 7, 2017, the Queensland Parliament introduced a bill to amend legislation which, if passed, would increase civil penalties for mining companies breaching their obligations under the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 (CMSHA Bill). The proposed amendments would also give the Chief Executive of the Department of Natural Resources and Mining new powers to suspend or cancel an individual’s statutory certificate of competency and issue site senior executives (SSEs) notices if they fail to meet their safety and health obligations. Higher levels of competency for the statutory position of ventilation officer at underground mines will also be required if the legislation is passed.
However, the CMSHA Bill lapsed on October 29, 2017 when a Queensland state election was called. It is expected that the bill, or one substantially similar thereto, will be reintroduced into Parliament in the near future.
Industrial Relations.  A national industrial relations system administered by the federal government applies to all private sector employers and employees. The matters regulated under the national system include employment conditions, unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial action and resolution of workplace disputes. Many of the workers employed in our mines are covered by enterprise agreements approved under the national system. 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act).  The NGER Act imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting system. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The Department of Environment and Energy is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review. Both foreign and local corporations that meet the prescribed carbon dioxide and energy production or consumption limits in Australia (Controlling Corporations) must comply with the NGER Act. One of our subsidiaries is now registered as a Controlling Corporation and must report annually on the greenhouse gas emissions and energy production and consumption of our Australian entities.
On July 1, 2016, amendments to the NGER Act implemented the Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism.  From that date, large designated facilities such as coal mines were issued with a baseline for their covered emissions and must take steps to keep their emissions at or below the baseline or face penalties.

Queensland Royalty. Royalties are payable to the State of Queensland at a rate of 12.5% on coal prices over $100 Australian dollars per tonne and up to $150 Australian dollars per tonne and 15% on pricing over $150 Australian dollars per tonne. The rate is 7% for coal sold below $100 Australian dollars per tonne. The periodic impact of these royalty rates is dependent upon the volume of tonnes produced at each of our Queensland mining locations and coal prices received for those tonnes. The Queensland Office of State Revenue issues determinations setting out its interpretation of the laws that impose royalties and provide guidance on how royalty rates should be calculated.
New South Wales Royalty. In New South Wales, the royalty applicable to coal is charged as a percentage of the value of production (total revenue less allowable deductions). This is equal to 6.2% for deep underground mines (coal extracted at depths greater than 400 meters below ground surface), 7.2% for underground mines and 8.2% for open-cut mines.
Global Climate 
In the U.S., Congress has considered legislation addressing global climate issues and greenhouse gas emissions, but to date nothing has been enacted. While it is possible that the U.S. will adopt legislation in the future, the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are uncertain. In the absence of new U.S. federal legislation, the EPA is undertaking steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA commenced several rulemaking projects as described under “Regulatory Matters-U.S. - Environmental Laws and Regulations.” In particular, on August 3, 2015, the EPA announced the final rules (which were published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015) for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-fired EGUs. The EPA has set emission performance rates for existing plants to be phased in over the period from 2022 through 2030. This rule is intended to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the 2005 baseline by 28% in 2025 and 32% in 2030. The EPA has also set standards applying to new, modified and reconstructed sources beginning in 2015.
A number of states in the U.S. have adopted programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, 10 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005, which is a mandatory cap-and-trade program to cap regional carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. In 2011, New Jersey announced its withdrawal from RGGI effective January 1, 2012. Six mid-western states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) and one Canadian province have entered into the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA) to establish voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a voluntary multi-sector cap-and-trade system to help meet the targets. It has been reported that, while the MGGRA has not been formally suspended, the participating states are no longer pursuing it. Seven western states (Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington) and four Canadian provinces entered into the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) in 2008 to establish a voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction goal and develop market-based strategies to achieve emissions reductions. However, in November 2011, the WCI announced that six states had withdrawn from the WCI, leaving California and four Canadian provinces as the remaining members. Of those five jurisdictions, only California and Quebec have adopted greenhouse gas cap-and-trade regulations to date and both programs have begun operating. Many of the states and provinces that left WCI, RGGI and MGGRA, along with many that continue to participate, have joined the new North America 2050 initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create economic opportunities in ways not limited to cap-and-trade programs. 
In the U.S., several states have enacted legislation establishing greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals or requirements. In addition, several states have enacted legislation or have in effect regulations requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power or that provide financial incentives to electricity suppliers for using renewable energy sources. Some states have initiated public utility proceedings that may establish values for carbon emissions.
We participated in the Department of Energy’s Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program until its suspension in May 2011, and regularly disclose in our Corporate and Social Responsibility Report the quantity of emissions per ton of coal produced by us in the U.S. The vast majority of our emissions are generated by the operation of heavy machinery to extract and transport material at our mines and fugitive emissions from the extraction of coal.
In 2013, the U.S. and a number of international development banks, including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced that they would no longer provide financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants or would do so only in narrowly defined circumstances. Other international development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, have continued to provide such financing.

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 by the signatories to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established a binding set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol but it has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 and became a full member in March 2008.  There were discussions to develop a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after the expiration of its commitment period in 2012, including at the UNFCCC conferences in Cancun (2010), Durban (2011), Doha (2012) and Paris (2015). At the Durban conference, an ad hoc working group was established to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC, applicable to all parties. At the Doha meeting, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, which included new commitments for certain parties in a second commitment period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2012, Australia signed on to the second commitment period. During the UNFCCC conference in Paris, France in late 2015, an agreement was adopted calling for voluntary emissions reductions contributions after the second commitment period ends in 2020. The agreement was entered into force on November 4, 2016 after ratification and execution by more than 55 countries, including Australia, that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump Administration has announced the U.S. will begin the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.
Australia’s Parliament passed carbon pricing legislation in November 2011. The first program involved the imposition of a carbon tax that commenced in July 2012. On July 16, 2014, Australia’s Parliament repealed the legislation, which was retrospectively abolished from July 1, 2014. 
In October 2017, the Australian government announced the National Energy Guarantee (NEG). The NEG is intended to reduce the supply volatility and escalating prices that currently exist in the Australian east coast electricity network and provide for affordable, reliable electricity while still meeting Australia’s emissions targets. The NEG has an energy neutral focus. It is expected that the Renewable Energy Target (RET) will not continue beyond its currently planned end date in 2020. 
The impact of the NEG on the Company’s operations using electricity is yet to be determined as the details of the NEG are still being formulated by the Australian government. The NEG requires approval of the Council of Australian Governments to come into effect. 
Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the use of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of development and deployment of CCUS technologies as well as acceptance of CCUS technologies to meet regulations and the alternative uses for coal. Similarly, higher-efficiency coal-fired power plants may also be an option for meeting laws or regulations related to emissions from coal use. Several countries, including some major coal users such as China, India and Japan, included using higher-efficiency coal-fueled power plants in their plans under the Paris Agreement. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
