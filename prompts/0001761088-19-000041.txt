ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
STWC Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 25, 2007, in the State of Utah as 4th Grade Films, Inc. In June 2016 we changed our corporate domicile to the State of Colorado by merging with a wholly-owned subsidiary formed solely for this purpose on August 5, 2015.  We have one wholly-owned subsidiary, Strainwise, Inc., a Colorado corporation originally formed as a limited liability company on June 8, 2012 and converted to a corporation on January 16, 2014.  This entity was acquired by us in 2014.  We also have a majority-owned subsidiary, Meridian A, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company formed on December 13, 2018.  We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries.
 
Since 2012 we have provided fulfillment services to medical and retail stores, and cultivation facilities in the regulated cannabis industry throughout the United States. These services are only provided to stores and facilities located in geographical areas where the governing state and local ordinances allow for the unfettered provisions of such services.
 
Discontinued Prior Operations
 
 During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, we divested ourselves of nearly all our material assets and settled a significant amount of liabilities due to events precipitated by an agreement between the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED) and Shawn Phillips, our former principal officer. In accordance with the MED Agreement, Mr. Phillips sold all regulated entities owned by us to third parties. As a result of sale of these regulated entities, we terminated our subleases with these entities or sublet the facilities.  In addition, we released Mr. Phillips and the regulated entities from approximately $3,200,000 in accounts receivables in exchange for Mr. Phillips' assumption of $2,550,000 of our obligations under various promissory notes.
 
 We also terminated the agreement with the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. As a result of the termination of the agreement, the funds held by Sentinel Strainwise, LLC, a joint venture company in which we held 50% equity interest, were distributed back to the partners of the joint venture and Sentinel Strainwise was dissolved.

 
 Further, in or around February 2017, we sold a 5,000 square foot commercial building located at in Denver, Colorado, for $1,000,000, the net profits from which were used to pay off the related purchase loan, satisfy a Deed of Trust with Green Acres Partners A, LLC, and for our operation expenses.
 
 As a result of the foregoing transactions, we have been able to re-focus on growing the Strainwise® brand and increasing its operations by expanding our business plan to include Company-owned stores in jurisdictions where regulations allow for public company ownership. In jurisdictions where public company ownership is prohibited or uncertain, we will continue to use management and licensing contracts to implement our business plan.
 
Current Operations
 
Beginning in June 2017 we entered into four Master Services Agreements (each, a "Master Agreement") with clients, namely COPR Enterprises, LLC (an entity 39% owned by Erin Phillips, our CEO, a directory, and principal shareholder), STWC Sorrento Valley, LLC (which is 27.5% owned by Ms. Phillips), 2600 Meridian, LLC (which is 25% owned by us), and HWH Farms, LLC (We have an option to purchase 25% of the LLC). The Master Agreements contain substantially similar terms, except as detailed herein. Pursuant to the Master Agreements, we provide compliance, financial, marketing and administrative services for clients' intended cannabis outlets and services for the design, build out, and long-term management of one or more medical cannabis dispensary facilities or in one case a medical cannabis cultivation and processing facility. We receive cash compensation for the services provided under the agreements once the facilities are operational. Each party to the Master Agreement has agreed to indemnify and defend the other party from and against all third-party claims and liabilities. The terms of the Master Agreements will continue until terminated by the respective parties in accordance with the provisions of the Master Agreements.  Together with each Master Agreement, we also enter into a trademark agreement granting the client the use of our relevant trademarks, a five-year management agreement whereby we agree to manage, operate, maintain and service the client's facility, and a consultant services agreement whereby we provide the client with our expertise, knowledge, and guidance in regards to the cannabis industry, licensing requirements, facility design, bookkeeping and accounting, at an hourly billable rate.  2600 Meridian and HWH Farms have been licensed by the state of Oklahoma and are in the build-out phase of their facilities but have not yet generated any revenues.

Under the COPR agreement COPR intends to open four dispensaries in the San Juan area of Puerto Rico, and we are currently seeking appropriate locations. We anticipate that these dispensaries will be approximately 1,500 to 1,700 square feet and will be open by fall 2019.  One of these dispensaries is under construction in the Loiza neighborhood and will be approximately 1,100 square feet.  We anticipate it will be open by the end of summer 2019, but its opening will be dependent upon compliance with building and licensing requirements.  STWC Sorrento Valley anticipates opening an 1,100 square foot dispensary in San Diego County, California, by spring 2020.  Likewise, this opening will be dependent upon compliance with city and state licensing requirements.  2600 Meridian opened a dispensary in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, near the airport, in April 2019.  This facility consists of approximately 200 square feet and is sharing space with a CBD store opened in February 2019 by Meridian A, LLC.  Plans include moving the facility to a 3,500 square foot space by the end of 2019.  HWH Farms is a cultivation and processing center located in Boise City, Oklahoma, consisting of approximately 5,000 square feet (3,000 square feet grow and 2,000 square feet processing).  We anticipate that it will open by end of the summer 2019, dependent upon approval from the fire marshal.  The grow and processing facilities are currently 75% built out.
 
We were unable to obtain necessary zoning for a facility in Oceanside, California, and we have thus abandoned this project.
 
We also applied for an adult-use retail dispensary license for a location in West Hollywood, California, but were unsuccessful in obtaining the license.  As a result, we have abandoned this project.
 
Additionally, we have entered into management and licensing agreements with a private entity in Puerto Rico (39% owned by Ms. Phillips) to operate four dispensaries and one cultivation operations in Puerto Rico. While public companies are not currently allowed to own a beneficial interest in licensed cannabis businesses in Puerto Rico, we intend to negotiate the right to acquire the private company at an agreed to price in the event that regulations permit public company ownership in the future. We have provided approximately $281,000 to fund Puerto Rican operations, which will be evidenced by a promissory note.  We are in the process of building out the first dispensary and seeking locations for two additional dispensaries.
 
 In connection with a funding agreement with Richland Fund, LLC, we agreed to form a subsidiary company with the intent that of the 3,000,000 shares of the subsidiary's outstanding stock, 1,000,000 shares would be issued to Richland and 2,000,000 shares would be distributed to the shareholders of our Company on a pro rata basis. Until distribution to the other shareholders, we would hold 2,000,000 shares of the subsidiary for voting purposes. We have yet to determine what assets will be held in the subsidiary.


 On September 5, 2018, we entered into a Binding Term Sheet (the "BTS") with Michael Hornbeck ("Hornbeck") for the acquisition of  an interest in to-be-established joint-venture entity (the "JV Entity") that will hold the intellectual property assets related to HiLife Creative (et. al.) ("HiLife"). Pursuant to the BTS, we agreed to pay $120,000 overall consideration in cash and stock, payable as follows:  $25,000 within 24 hours of execution of the BTS; $25,000 on or before November 1, 2018; 500,000 shares of common stock in STWC; and 500,000 common share purchase warrants.   We also assumed approximately $70,000 in debt owned by Hornbeck to various creditors.  The $70,000 assumed by us will be paid to Hornbeck or his assigns pursuant to a yet to be executed promissory note with a maturity date of January 31, 2019.  The JV Entity will be 51% owned by us and 49% by Michael Hornbeck or assign(s). Although the BTS contemplated management control of the JV Entity by Hornbeck, we have since terminated our relationship with him and intend to proceed with the transaction with HiLife without involvement or ownership by Hornbeck.


On October 16, 2018, we and 2600 Meridian, LLC ("2600 Meridian"), of which 75% is owned by Amber Murdock, entered into a Development Agreement (the "Development Agreement") pursuant to which we agreed to assist in 2600 Meridian's efforts relating to the funding, development, and construction of any facility, seeking technical experience and expertise for the development and operation of the facilities, and instruction and training for its members in the development and operation of the facilities. Under the Development Agreement we receive a flat fee of $5,000 for each facility we help develop. The agreement will continue until certain milestone are reached and certain deliveries are made to 2600 Meridian.  During the year ended January 31, 2019, we loaned $29,368 to 2600 Meridian.  The first dispensary under this agreement was opened in April 2019.
 
In January 2019 we entered into a joint venture arrangement with Amber Murdock through the creation of an Oklahoma limited liability company named Meridian A, LLC ("Meridian A"), of which we own 75% of the outstanding members' units.  Meridian was formed to market Hemp-derived CBD projects to the general public and the first dispensary was opened in February 2019.  Ms. Phillips serves as the sole Managing Member of Meridian A. Our role will be to facilitate industry and operational knowledge, product sourcing, and brand management, and to manage administrative, office, and support staff. Ms. Murdock will manage all day to day operational activities and staffing of Meridian A.  We will also furnish operational funding for the business.

Marketing
 
We market our fulfillment services through our personal and business contacts, on social media, and at trade shows.  We have participated in a number of national trade shows in the past and anticipate attending two this year, at which we will sponsor a booth and participate on presentation panels. We monitor all social media marketing internally, but we intend to engage an outside consultant during the current year to develop a targeted social media marketing campaign.
Competition
 
There are a number of companies providing some or all of the fulfillment services furnished by us to our customers, many of which are larger and better financed.  We believe there are few, however, that provide all of the services we furnish, and many of these consulting firms consist of persons experienced in business consulting, but few with experience in the marijuana industry.  Because of the extensive experience of our management team, we believe we can compete favorably with others in the industry.  We also believe that the fees we charge for our fulfillment services are very competitive with other companies in the industry.
Government Regulation
 
The Company is not engaged in the direct growth, cultivation, harvesting and distribution of cannabis. However, we do offer consulting services to licensed operators and applicants for state offered cannabis licenses, who seek to engage in the medical and/or recreational cannabis business in those state jurisdictions where cannabis has been legalized.
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis is a “Schedule 1” drug under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”) and is illegal under federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
On August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.
  4
 
In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including: the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA, and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.
 
Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally-run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is a still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
