Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview. Teradata Corporation ("we," "us," "Teradata," or the "Company") is a global leader in analytic data solutions and services. Our analytic data solutions comprise software, hardware, and related business consulting and support services for analytics across a company’s entire analytical ecosystem. We help customers access and manage data and use analytics to extract business value and insight from their data. We work with our customers enabling them to leverage data and analytics to drive business outcomes such as, but not limited to:

• | Improving a customer’s experience through understanding behavioral patterns,

4


• | Driving financial transformation with accurate and timely data, and


• | Creating more efficient utilization of assets through machine learning of sensor data.

Our consulting services include a broad range of offerings, including consulting to help organizations establish an analytic vision, to enable an analytical ecosystem architecture and to ensure value delivery of their analytical infrastructure, among other things. We do this through flexible deployment options, including the Teradata Cloud and public clouds, as well as on-premises on Teradata hardware or commodity hardware. 
We serve customers around the world across a broad set of industries with offerings for the world’s largest analytic data opportunities. Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States ("U.S.") with the primary locations being Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California, Dayton, Ohio; and Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 44 countries. 
For the full year ended December 31, 2017, we had total revenues of $2.156 billion, of which approximately 55% was derived from the Americas Data and Analytics segment and 45% from the International Data and Analytics segment. For financial information about these segments and geographic information, see “Note 11—Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
History. Teradata started in a garage in Brentwood California and was incorporated in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. In 1984, Teradata established a massively parallel relational database management system that enabled companies to easily scale their data management needs, revolutionizing data analysis for customers. In 1991, Teradata was acquired and operated as a division of another company until it was spun off as an independent, publicly-traded company, Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) on September 30, 2007.
Industry and Market Opportunity. Our view is that analytics is and will continue to be a management priority for leading companies. We believe Teradata’s strategy positions us to address a large market opportunity within the multi-billion dollar and growing data management and analytics markets. Organizations are going through a digital transformation and data and analytics are at the core of this evolution, and we believe that companies need help leveraging analytics and data to deliver high-impact business outcomes. We also believe that companies need help in designing and implementing the right analytical ecosystem for their needs. We have tailored Teradata's offerings to meet these needs and to help companies navigate the multitude of ecosystem options, as well as various alternatives for deployment.
Our Strategy. Teradata’s strategy is based around our core belief that analytics and data unleash the potential of great companies allowing them to make better and faster decisions and attain competitive advantage. We empower companies to achieve high-impact business outcomes through analytics at scale on an agile data foundation. With our focus to lead with business outcomes and a consultative approach, our goal is to serve as a trusted advisor to both the business and technical leaders in our customers’ organizations. Our business analytics solutions and technology are ideally suited for the world’s largest companies that have the largest and most complex analytics challenges, where scale and performance of such solutions matter.
Our strategy is to provide a differentiated set of offerings to this target market through a portfolio of data and analytics solutions, including the following:

• | Teradata IntelliCloudTM: Through this "as-a-service" offering, we manage the software and infrastructure for our customers, so they can focus on successful business outcomes. This includes management of performance, security, availability and operations all delivered with a "pay-as-you-go" price model. Teradata's IntelliCloud can be deployed on-premises, in private clouds as well as in public clouds; 


• | Teradata Analytics Platform: Our market-leading integrated data warehouse engine has evolved to include access to the best analytic functions and leading analytic engines, leveraging preferred tools and languages against multiple data types integrated at scale; 


• | Business Analytics Consulting and Solutions: By engaging with business users through solution-based selling that leverages analytic consulting, our customers can realize high-value business outcomes; and


• | Ecosystem Architecture Consulting: Our best-in-class architecture consulting expertise helps customers build optimized analytical ecosystems, leveraging both open source and commercial solutions.

5

A foundational element of the Teradata strategy is Teradata Everywhere™ which brings together our expanded offerings across cloud and on-premises deployments with a flexible pricing and licensing model to de-risk customer purchase decisions enabling customers to move forward with confidence knowing their investments are protected no matter where or how they deploy in the future. 
Through Teradata Everywhere, customers can:

• | Analyze Anything - enables analytic users throughout the organization to use their preferred analytic tools and engines across data sources, at scale;


• | Deploy Anywhere - provides analytic processing in the Teradata Cloud, in public clouds, as well as on-premises, providing flexibility to change as business needs evolve;


• | Buy Any Way - allows companies to purchase our software on a subscription-basis as well as on a perpetual basis at different price points; and


• | Move Anytime - includes software license portability that provides flexibility to run analytics and move their software as needed across deployment options, such as moving from on-premises to cloud.

In support of our strategy, we continue to optimize our go-to-market and sales approach to improve effectiveness in demand creation and address new and expanded market opportunities, such as with our consultative business solutions and cloud offerings. We will continue investing in partnerships to increase the number of solutions available on Teradata software, maximize customer value, and increase our market coverage.
We believe our consultative business outcome-led approach and our portfolio of offerings that provide customers choice in how they procure and deploy analytics will best position us to be our customers’ trusted advisor and partner of choice for architecting, implementing, and managing their analytic environments.
Our long-term strategic objectives are to:

• | Deliver business outcomes for our customers through analytics at scale, by


• | Focusing on companies with the largest analytic opportunities, by


• | Offering market-leading technology, that is enabled by a


• | World-class go-to-market sales, consulting and support team, with the goal of


• | Generating recurring revenue, earnings, and cash flow growth.

Customers. Teradata is focused on both business users and technology buyers at the 500 companies with the largest analytic opportunities. We believe that not only does this segment of the market have the most challenging needs where scale and performance matter, but also where Teradata provides the most business value to the customer. We plan to grow revenue in this market segment by expanding our existing customers' analytical ecosystems as well as adding new customers. We believe that key differentiators for Teradata in this segment include:

• | Proven experience in delivering business outcomes which require complex analytics at scale;


• | Real-world expertise developing and deploying analytical platforms and ecosystems; and


• | Leading enterprise-class deployments at large scale.

We are focused on a broad set of industries, including communications, ecommerce, financial services, government, gaming, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media and entertainment, oil and gas, retail, travel and transportation, and utilities. These industries provide a good fit for our analytics solutions and services, as they tend to have the greatest analytic potential, with large and growing data volumes and expanding sources of data, complex data management requirements, or large and varied groups of users.
The extent to which any given customer contributes to our revenues generally varies significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. Historically, a customer with a large order in one period generated additional revenue for Teradata in subsequent periods as we provide support services and additional capacity as their analytical ecosystem evolves and grows to meet their business requirements. Moreover, Teradata’s revenue can vary considerably from period to period given the different growth and purchasing patterns of our existing customers’ analytical environments as well as the variable timing of new customer orders. Due to the size and complexity of these transactions (purchases), the sales cycle for a new analytic solution is often long (typically more than a year). Historically, our results in any quarter have generally been dependent on our ability to generate a relatively small number of large orders for that quarter. However, we are actively converting customers from perpetual to subscription-based purchasing options, which will result in more ratable revenue recognition and will likely increase the predictability of our revenue.
6

Seasonality. Historically our sales are seasonal, in line with capital spending patterns of our customers, with lower revenue typically in the first quarter and higher revenue generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing and mix of product sales. Typically, cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to collections of the higher receivable balances at December 31 and receipts from annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months. However, we are actively converting customers from perpetual to subscription-based purchasing options, which will likely increase the predictability of our revenue and will over time reduce the seasonal variability. These factors, among others as more fully described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results.
Backlog. Our backlog was approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2017 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Approximately $1.1 billion of the backlog at December 31, 2017 is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2018. Backlog includes firm contracts for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered. Backlog includes $499 million at December 31, 2017 and $383 million at December 31, 2016 for backlog that that has been invoiced and therefore is included in deferred revenue. Although we believe that the contract value included in backlog is firm, some contracts may include general cancellation for convenience terms that the Company is contractually obligated to perform unless the customer notifies Teradata. Customers typically do not cancel before the end of the contractual term and historically Teradata has seen very little churn in its customer base. Further, we have a historically large portion of our business each quarter generated by orders that are sold and fulfilled within the same reporting period. Therefore, the amount of backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future results. 
Sales, Marketing and Partners
Sales and Marketing. We primarily sell and market our solutions and services through a direct sales force, and have aligned our sales teams to best address the 500 largest analytic opportunities globally. We have approximately 80% of our employees in customer-facing and/or revenue driving roles (including sales, consulting and customer service, and product engineering).
We support our sales force with marketing and training programs which are designed to:

• | Grow awareness, highlighting our technology leadership, differentiation and consulting expertise;


• | Create demand for our products and services;


• | Educate the sales force to build skills and knowledge; and,


• | Provide a robust set of tools for use by our direct sales force.

We employ a broad range of marketing strategies including programs to inform and educate customers and prospects, the media, industry analysts, academics and other third-party influencers. These strategies include targeted, account-based marketing, our global website, webinars, physical and virtual trade shows and conferences, public and media relations, social media, and an extensive customer reference program.
Strategic Partnerships. We seek to leverage our sales and marketing reach by partnering with leading global and regional systems integrators, independent software vendors, open source software distributors, consultants, and universities which we believe complement our analytic offerings. Strategic partnerships are a key factor in our ability to leverage the value and expand the scope of our analytic offerings in the marketplace.

• | Alliance Partners: Our partner program is focused on working collaboratively with independent software vendors in several areas, including tools, data and application integration solutions, data mining, analytics, business intelligence, specific analytic and industry solutions. Our goal is to provide choices to our customers with partner offerings that are optimized and certified to deliver end-to-end analytic and data solutions, and fit within the customer’s analytic environment.


• | Systems Integrators: In some cases, we also work with a range of systems integrators and consultants that engage in the design, implementation and integration of analytic solutions and analytic applications for our joint clients. Our strategic partnerships with select global consulting and systems integration firms provide broad industry and technology expertise in the design of business solutions that leverage Teradata technology to enable enterprise analytics.

Competition. We compete in a large and growing market that is attractive to both current and new competitors. Our competition includes new analytics services companies, cloud vendors and open source providers, as well as large traditional competitors, such as IBM, SAP and Oracle. We believe our focus on business outcomes and proven success will enable us to successfully compete with the largest analytic opportunities in the market. Our software is highly differentiated and delivers significant value at scale. This coupled with our ability to deploy across cloud and on-premises options, with flexible purchasing and licensing options, provides our customers the ability to de-risk their buying decisions. Our proven consulting capabilities delivers value to our customers to enable them to be successful in their markets. We believe that our technology, flexibility and consulting will collectively enable us to continue to compete successfully. For more information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Key factors used to evaluate competitors in these markets include: data and analytics experience; business outcome delivery; hybrid cloud offerings and experience; customer references; technology leadership; product quality; performance, scalability, availability and manageability; support and consulting services capabilities; management of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem; industry knowledge; and total cost of ownership. We believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete, integrated, and optimized analytic data platforms and analytic
services that address customers’ business, technical and architecture requirements. Our differentiation is especially strong with customers that have mission critical, complex, large scale environments and requirements.
Research and Development ("R&D"). We remain focused on designing and developing data and analytic technologies that anticipate our customers' evolving needs. As we seek improvements in our products and services, we also consider our customers' current, as well as future needs as we design our new technology so that new generations of the Teradata software and platform technology are compatible with prior generations of our technology. We believe our extensive R&D workforce is one of our core strengths. Our global R&D team is located in multiple facilities around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures, which may include complementary strategic acquisitions, to help support the flow of innovative, high-quality products, cloud-based offerings, services and applications, which is vital to our leading competitive position. For information regarding the accounting and costs included in R&D activities see “Note 1-Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Intellectual Property and Technology. The Company owns 684 patents in the U.S. and 38 patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of the Company’s U.S. patents. Many of the patents that we own are licensed to others, and we are licensed to use certain patents owned by others. While our portfolio of patents and patent applications in aggregate is of significant value to our Company, we do not believe that any individual patent is by itself of material importance to our business.
In addition, the Company owns copyrights and trade secrets in its vast code base which makes up all of the Teradata software products including analytic data platforms and analytic applications. Teradata’s software products reflect the investment of hundreds of person-years of development work.
The source code versions of our products are protected as trade secrets and, in all major markets, as unpublished copyright works. We also take great efforts to protect our rights in all software products and related intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company owns the Teradata® and Aster® trademarks, which are registered in the U.S. and in many foreign countries, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks.
Sources of Materials. Our hardware components are assembled and configured by Flex Ltd. (“Flex”). Our platform line is designed to leverage the components from industry leaders. Our data storage devices and memory components utilize industry-standard technologies but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform. Flex also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure business continuity of supply. Given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to Flex and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flex or at a supplier, or a global shortage of components, could impact the timing or profitability of 
8

customer shipments. In addition, a significant change in the forecasts to any of these preferred suppliers could result in purchase obligations for components that may be in excess of demand.
Employees. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 10,615 employees globally. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel. 
Properties and Facilities. Our corporate headquarters is currently located in Dayton, Ohio, although our Rancho Bernardo (San Diego), California and Johns Creek (Atlanta), Georgia facilities are also primary locations (within the U.S.). As of December 31, 2017, we operated 112 facilities in 44 countries throughout the world. We own our Rancho Bernardo complex, while all other facilities are leased.
