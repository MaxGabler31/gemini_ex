Item 1. Business
Introduction
OHA Investment Corporation
We are a specialty finance company with an investment objective to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments, some of which may include equity components. We focus primarily on providing creative direct lending solutions to middle market private companies across industry sectors. Our investment activities are managed by OHA and supervised by our Board of Directors, the majority of whose members are independent of OHA and its affiliates.
We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or a BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act. For federal income tax purposes, we operate so as to be treated as a regulated investment company, or a RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain investment diversification and other regulatory requirements.
On September 30, 2014, our stockholders approved the appointment of OHA as our investment advisor, replacing NGP Investment Advisor, LP, which had been our investment advisor since our inception. In connection with this change in investment advisor, we changed our name from NGP Capital Resources Company to OHA Investment Corporation, or OHAI. OHA is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Advisers Act. OHA acts as our investment advisor and administrator pursuant to an investment advisory agreement and an administration agreement, respectively, each dated as of September 30, 2014, which we refer to as the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, respectively.
The aggregate fair value of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 was $65.6 million, with such value comprised of 26 active portfolio company investments. Under our previous investment advisor, NGP Capital Resources Company, we focused our investments primarily on small and mid-size companies engaged in the upstream sector of the energy industry, which includes businesses that find, develop and extract energy resources, including natural gas, crude oil and coal. The fair value of the investment portfolio at September 30, 2014 was $171.0 million, of which $126.8 million, or 74% was energy related investments. Since that time, the energy sector has experienced significant declines and volatility in commodity prices for oil and natural gas prices. As a result, many companies in the the oil and gas industry were negatively impacted and had to restructure their balance sheets. Since September 30, 2014, we have written off $97.9 million, or 77.2%, of the portfolio that was affiliated with our legacy energy related investments and we have written off $113.5 million, or 66.4% of our total legacy portfolio.
Part of OHA’s investment strategy has been to reduce our historical portfolio concentration in the energy industry and to diversify our portfolio with investments in debt securities of U.S. private and small public middle market companies across industry sectors. Since September 30, 2014, we have made a total of 35 new investments in portfolio companies with a principal amount of $175.4 million (total cost of $171.1 million) and fully realized 11 of these investments with a principal amount of $99.6 million. Primarily as a result of these new investments, net of realizations, and write-downs of legacy energy investments, the exposure of our investment portfolio in the energy sector decreased to 7% at December 31, 2018. 
Our Investment Advisor
OHA is a leading independent investment firm specializing in direct lending, high yield bonds, leveraged loans, distressed investments, mortgage strategies and corporate structured products. With approximately $33 billion of capital under management as of December 2018, OHA employs a fundamental value-oriented strategy focused on credit analysis, relative value analysis, risk-adjusted return generation, loss avoidance and active risk management that has been in place for more than two decades. OHA has substantial experience in direct lending, having invested approximately $5.5 billion in over 150 direct lending investments over the past 15+ years. Headquartered in New York, OHA employs more than 300 people, and has been registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act since 2004.
OHA is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments, and monitoring our investments on an ongoing basis. We pay OHA a 
1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

base management fee as a percentage of our assets and incentive fees as a percentage of our net investment income and net capital gains. Managing our portfolio is an extension of OHA’s direct lending activities to middle market companies, which OHA defines as companies with annual revenues of $50 million to $1 billion.
We have an investment committee that evaluates and approves each of our investments, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors. All key investment decisions made by OHA on our behalf require the approval of a majority of the members of the investment committee. OHA’s extensive team of investment professionals, including industry analysts and portfolio managers, actively source, evaluate and monitor our investments.
Our Investment Approach
OHA (and its affiliated investment advisors and predecessor firms) continues to build on its over 20-year history of investing in various asset classes and believes that its past success is a reflection of the firm’s consistent investment philosophy, strategy and process. As our investment advisor, OHA has sought to expand our portfolio’s exposure to a broader range of industries beyond energy, focusing on the middle market. OHA believes that middle market companies are generally less able to secure financing from public financial markets than larger companies and thus offer better return opportunities for firms able to originate and structure these investments, along with conducting the necessary diligence to appropriately evaluate these opportunities.
The OHA investment team employs an opportunistic, credit-driven investing approach rather than a broad origination model, leveraging the depth and breadth of its credit research team to seek value creation through long-term investment results. OHA looks for investment opportunities across the capital structure of middle market companies, using a fundamental value-oriented investment strategy. We believe that this approach will yield a highly diversified investment portfolio across asset classes, industries and capital structures. Our investment approach seeks attractive risk-adjusted returns while attempting to limit the risk of potential capital losses.
OHA expects that most of our new investments will be in senior and junior secured, unsecured and subordinated debt securities in U.S. private and small public middle market companies with maturities ranging from three to seven years. However, OHA seeks to identify attractive investments throughout the capital structure and thus may invest in equity, distressed debt, residual interests of CLOs and other assets. We may invest in newly issued securities and acquire investments in the secondary market.
The companies in which OHA intends to invest are typically highly leveraged, and, in most cases, our investments in such companies will not be rated by national rating agencies. If such companies were rated, we believe that they would typically receive a rating below investment grade (between BB and CCC under the Standard & Poor’s system) from the national rating agencies, which are often referred to as “junk.” From time to time, OHA may invest opportunistically in other types of investments, consistent with the provisions of the 1940 Act.
Our Board of Directors has the authority to modify or waive our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. However, under the 1940 Act, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC without stockholder approval.
Investment Sourcing and Selection.  OHA pursues selective direct origination from its extensive network of relationships with key financial sponsors, financial institutions, middle market companies, management teams, corporations and other sources, and it has sought to position itself as a value-added partner in club transactions by private equity firms. OHA believes its experience in the below-investment-grade credit markets positions it well to execute private deals and capture illiquidity premiums and attractive, uncorrelated returns that may be found in this market.
In originating assets, OHA employs multiple channels and leverages the extensive relationships of the broader OHA platform. OHA’s decision to select an investment for our portfolio stems directly from OHA’s long-established investment approach, which focuses on intensive credit analysis, relative value analysis, risk-adjusted return generation and loss avoidance. As part of this process, OHA continuously looks to originate new ideas, perform due diligence on these opportunities and execute on those investments that meet OHA’s investment criteria. OHA has extensive direct lending experience spanning several credit cycles.
BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest on a concurrent basis with certain affiliated entities in the absence of an exemptive order from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to and may simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated point. In an order dated April 25, 2016, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting us, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain investment transactions with certain OHA affiliates where terms other than price are negotiated. We believe this relief will enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategy and may also increase favorable investment opportunities for us, in part, by allowing us to participate in larger investments, together with our co-investment affiliates, than would be available to us if such relief had not been obtained. However, there can be no assurance that such exemptive relief will permit us to fully achieve these goals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Due Diligence.  OHA believes that each investment opportunity should stand on its own merits rather than being dependent upon macro views held by the chief investment officer or a research analyst. In performing diligence on direct lending opportunities, an investigation is typically conducted by a team of research analysts and portfolio managers. The process entails, among other considerations: business analysis, capital structure analysis and valuation analysis. Business analysis involves a comprehensive fundamental evaluation of a company, including historical and projected financial modeling. Capital structure analysis evaluates the terms and structure of a company’s debt and equity securities relative to the company’s business risk. Valuation analysis considers the enterprise value of a company in both the public and private markets.
OHA’s credit process seeks to be quantitatively rigorous and qualitatively thorough, enhanced by OHA’s contacts throughout the investment community and industries it analyzes. Research analysts are encouraged to develop relationships with senior management, consultants, investment bankers, rating agencies and other experts in the industries they cover. OHA’s investment professionals also have extensive contact with senior professionals of OHA’s portfolio companies, and often perform frequent customer and supplier references. Typically, detailed written reports evaluate an investment’s merits and concerns and steer the discussions between the team of research analysts and portfolio managers. These discussions are critical to the decision to purchase or sell an investment, or to redirect the research process to areas that warrant further evaluation. The process is often iterative and can involve multiple investment discussions.
Monitoring Investments.  Once we have provided a financial commitment or investment with respect to a portfolio company, OHA monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The objective of OHA’s monitoring process is to identify current and potential value changes and be in a position to act accordingly. OHA actively monitors the financial performance of our portfolio companies through regular contact with the management teams, along with studying developments in the relevant industries and the financial markets. Constant, active monitoring allows OHA to maintain current risk assessments, address potential problems early, refine exit plans, and make prompt follow-on investment decisions.
Valuation Process
The majority of our investments are in securities for which market quotations are unavailable, or which have various degrees of restrictions on liquidity. We account for all of the assets in our portfolio at fair value, following the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” or ASC 820. Our Board of Directors determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio on a quarterly basis, as generally described below.

• | Investment Team Valuation. The investment professionals of OHA prepare fair value recommendations for each investment. 


• | Investment Team Valuation Documentation. The investment team documents and discusses its preliminary fair value recommendations with the investment committee and senior management of OHA. 


• | Third Party Valuation Activity. We may, at our discretion, retain an independent valuation firm to review any or all of the valuation analyses and fair value recommendations provided by the OHA investment team. As of December 31, 2018, our general practice is that we have an independent valuation firm review all Level 3 investments (those whose value is determined using significant unobservable inputs) with recommended fair values in excess of $10 million on a quarterly basis, and review all Level 3 investments with any meaningful fair value at least annually. 


• | Presentation to Audit Committee. OHA and our senior management present the valuation analyses and fair value recommendations to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 


• | Board of Directors and Audit Committee. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee review and discuss the valuation analyses and fair value recommendations provided by OHA and the analysis of the independent valuation firm, if applicable. 


• | Final Valuation Determination. Our Board of Directors discusses the fair values recommended by the Audit Committee and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio, in good faith, based on the input of OHA, our Audit Committee and the independent valuation firm, if applicable. 

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that a seller would receive for an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of observable market inputs over unobservable entity-specific inputs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Competition
Historically, our primary competitors in this market have consisted of public and private investment funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and other BDCs. Although these competitors regularly provide financing similar to most of our investments, a number of them focus on different aspects of these markets. We also face competition from other firms that are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments or yield targets, which allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more portfolio relationships than we can. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC; nor are they subject to the requirements imposed on RICs by the Code. Nevertheless, we believe that the relationships of the senior professionals of OHA should enable us to compete effectively for attractive investment opportunities.
Employees
We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by OHA. Our principal officers are our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer and our chief compliance officer. In addition to the chief financial officer, we have two other OHA employees dedicated full time to our operations. All of these individuals are employees of OHA. Our allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their staffs is paid by us pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The services necessary for the origination, monitoring and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by OHA.
Regulation
Business Development Company
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. By electing to be treated as a BDC, we are subject to various provisions of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election to be regulated as, a BDC without first obtaining the approval of a “majority of our outstanding voting securities,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the vote of holders of a “majority” means the vote of the holders of the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock present at a meeting or represented by proxy if holders of more than 50% of the shares of the company’s common stock are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
We are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share if (i) our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and (ii) our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. We may repurchase our shares subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act and the terms of our credit agreement. We also may conduct rights offerings at prices less than the net asset value per share, subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act. If we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, and our stockholders my experience dilution. See Risk Factors - Risk Relating to Our Business Structure - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.
As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 200%. On April 11, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Directors’ approval, or April 11, 2019. Under the current 200% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 11, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a Debt to Tangible Net Worth Ratio of not more than 1.00:1.00 (200% minimum asset coverage) with respect to certain provisions of our Credit Facility. We are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly

participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally are prohibited from (a) acquiring more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, (b) investing more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company, or (c) investing more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by registered investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses.
Qualifying Assets
A BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and operate for the purpose of investing in the types of securities described in 1, 2 and 3 below. As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:
1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions):

a. | is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding thirteen months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. The 1940 Act defines an eligible portfolio company as any issuer that:

i.is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;

ii. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company, or SBIC, wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and

iii.does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange

b. | is a company that meets the requirements of (a)(i) and (ii) above, but is not an eligible portfolio company because it has issued a class of securities on a national securities exchange, if:


i. | at the time of the purchase, we own at least 50% of (A) the greatest number of equity securities of such issuer and securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities; and (B) the greatest amount of debt securities of such issuer, held by us at any point in time during the period when such issuer was an eligible portfolio company; and;

ii.we are one of the 20 largest holders of such issuer’s outstanding voting securities; or;

c. | is a company that meets the requirements of (a)(i) and (ii) above, but is not an eligible portfolio company because it has issued a class of securities on a national securities exchange, if the aggregate market value of such company’s outstanding voting and non-voting common equity is less than $250 million.

2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.

3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of such issuer, or from any person in transactions incident thereto, if immediately prior to the purchase of its securities such issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization, or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities, and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities.


6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
As noted above, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in 1, 2 and 3 under the heading entitled “Qualifying Assets” above. In addition, BDCs generally must offer to make available to the 
5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

issuer of such securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of the securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments generally consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that at least 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we invest in U.S. Treasury Bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that we may invest in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the asset diversification requirements in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. OHA will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into any repurchase agreement transactions.
Senior Securities
The 1940 Act permits us, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of senior indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% (decreases to 150% after April 11, 2019) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may be required by the 1940 Act to make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We are also permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.
Code of Ethics
We and OHA have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisors Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and OHA have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and will review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We and OHA have each designated a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
While the majority of our investments are in debt securities, we may occasionally hold investments in publicly-traded equity securities. We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to OHA. The proxy voting policies and procedures of OHA are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by OHA and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment advisor registered under the Advisers Act, OHA has fiduciary duties to us. As part of this duty, OHA recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. OHA’s proxy voting policies and procedures have been formulated to ensure decision-making consistent with these fiduciary duties. These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
OHA votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives to be the best interest of our stockholders. OHA reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its effect on the portfolio securities held by us. Although OHA will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities, OHA may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so.
OHA’s proxy voting decisions are made by those senior investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that a vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, OHA requires that (1) anyone involved in 
6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the decision-making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how OHA intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. If a vote may involve a material conflict of interest, prior to approving such vote, OHA must consult with our chief compliance officer to determine whether the potential conflict is material and if so, the appropriate method to resolve such conflict. If the conflict is determined not to be material, OHA’s employees shall vote the proxy in accordance with OHA’s proxy voting policy.
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to Chief Compliance Officer, OHA Investment Corporation, 1114 Avenue of the Americas, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10036.
Other
We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Regulated Investment Company
As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code. As a RIC, we are generally not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on the portion of our investment company taxable income (which generally consists of ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, reduced by deductible expenses), or realized net capital gains, that we distribute, or deem to distribute, to stockholders on a timely basis.
Taxable income available for distribution differs from consolidated net investment income under GAAP due to (i) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, (ii) capital gains and losses, (iii) activity at taxable subsidiaries, and (iv) the timing and period of recognition regarding dividends declared in December of one year and paid in January of the following year. Dividends we declare and pay in a particular year generally differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income, the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year, or returns of capital.
We may also be subject to federal excise tax if we do not distribute an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for the calendar year (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, computed for the one year period ended October 31 of that calendar year, and (3) 100% of any ordinary income or capital gain net income not distributed or taxed in prior years. Dividends to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each year to maintain our status as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and to avoid excise taxes. If we do not meet this requirement, the Code imposes a nondeductible excise tax generally equal to 4% of the amount by which the required distribution exceeds the distribution for the year. The taxable income on which an excise tax is paid is generally carried forward and distributed to stockholders in the next tax year. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income.
In order to maintain our status as a RIC, we must, in general, (1) continue to qualify as a BDC; (2) derive at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of securities and other specified types of income; (3) meet asset diversification requirements as defined in the Code; and (4) timely distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our annual investment company taxable income as defined in the Code.
Investment Advisory Agreement
Management Services
OHA manages our investments and business pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our Board of Directors, a majority of whose members are not “interested” persons (as defined in the 1940 Act) of us, on August 2, 2018.
In determining to reapprove the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors requested information from OHA that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included:

• | information regarding the nature and quality of the advisory services rendered by OHA;


• | our performance;

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | the experience and qualifications of the personnel providing services to us;


• | the current fee structure under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was not proposed to be changed, and our current and anticipated expense ratio in relation to those of other BDCs with comparable investment policies and limitations, which the Board of Directors believed to be comparable to such other peer BDCs;


• | the absence of breakpoints in the fee structure, and the fact that due to our small asset size, OHA had not experienced to date any economies of scale in connection with its management of our investments and business;


• | the fees charged by OHA to its similar clients, which the Board of Directors did not believe to be a relevant consideration, as we are the sole BDC managed by OHA;


• | the direct and indirect costs incurred by OHA in performing services for us and the basis of determining and allocating such costs; and


• | any other possible benefits to OHA arising from its relationship with us.

Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our Board of Directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or OHA, concluded that the investment advisory fee rate and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and reapproved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.
Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, OHA manages the investment and reinvestment of our assets in accordance with our investment objectives and policies. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, OHA provides any and all management and investment advisory services necessary for the operation and conduct of our business and:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of our investments;


• | monitors the performance of, and manages our investments;


• | determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell and the terms on which any such securities and other assets are purchased and sold;


• | arranges for the disposition of our investments;


• | recommends to our Board of Directors the estimated fair value of our investments that are not publicly traded debt or equity securities, based on our valuation guidelines;


• | votes proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policy and procedures adopted by OHA; and


• | provides us with such other investment advice, research and related services as our Board of Directors may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our assets.

OHA’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not required to be exclusive, and OHA is free to furnish the same or similar services to other entities, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with us for particular investments, so long as its services to others do not impair its services to us. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, OHA also provides on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance under the 1940 Act and who request such assistance from us.
Management and Incentive Fees
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay OHA a fee for management services consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee.
Base Management Fee:  The base management fee is paid quarterly in arrears, and is calculated by multiplying the average value of our total assets (excluding cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills that are purchased with borrowed funds solely for the purpose of satisfying quarter-end diversification requirements related to our election to be taxed as a RIC under the Code), as of the end of the two immediately prior fiscal quarters, by a rate of 1.75% per annum.
Incentive Fee:  The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part, the investment income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the fiscal quarter for which the fee is being calculated. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income, royalty payments, net profits interest payments, and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, syndication,

structuring, diligence, monitoring and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Accordingly, we may pay (and in certain quarters, have paid) an incentive fee based partly on accrued investment income, the collection of which may be uncertain or deferred. Net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less liabilities at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter) is compared to a “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized). OHA receives no incentive fee for any fiscal quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate. OHA receives an incentive fee equal to 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for any fiscal quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) of net assets (also referred to as the “catch up” provision) plus 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for such fiscal quarter greater than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) of net assets. The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the investment income incentive fee:

The second part of the incentive fee, the capital gains fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or, upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date). The capital gains incentive fee is equal to 20% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from the date of the Investment Advisory Agreement through the end of that fiscal year, computed net of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and cumulative aggregate unrealized depreciation on investments for the same time period. The aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees to OHA is subtracted from the capital gains incentive fee calculated. If such amount is negative, then there is no capital gains fee for such year. For the purposes of the capital gains fee, any gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2014 shall be excluded from the capital gains incentive fee calculation.
On November 10, 2017, we entered into an Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement with OHA whereby OHA agreed to waive any incentive fees earned relating to fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Under the Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement, any capitalized gains fees that would have been earned and accrued during 2017 and 2018, which under our investment advisory agreement would not have been paid until 2018 and 2019, respectively, will be waived. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no capital gains incentive fees that would have been earned. For the year ended December 31, 2017, OHA waived $89,000 of capital gains incentive fee that would have been earned in 2017 and paid in 2018.
The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by a vote of our Board of Directors or the holders of a majority of our shares on 60 days’ written notice to OHA, and would automatically terminate in the event of its “assignment” (within the meaning of the 1940 Act). In addition, OHA may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon not more than 60 days’ written notice to us. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, OHA pays the compensation expense of its investment professionals, who provide management and investment advisory services to us. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.
Administration Agreement
Under the Administration Agreement, OHA furnishes us with certain administrative services, personnel and facilities. The Administration Agreement was most recently approved by our Board of Directors on August 2, 2018. Payments under the Administration Agreement will be equal to our allocable portion of OHA’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including all administrative services necessary for our operation and the conduct of our business. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by a vote of our Board of Directors or by OHA upon 60 days’ written notice to the other party.
