-------------------------------------------------+---------

Background



TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 24, 2018 for the purpose of developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on our patented Thin Film Freezing, or TFF, technology platform. We were formed by Lung Therapeutics, Inc., or LTI, an early-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of certain technologies in the pulmonary field. In March 2018, we completed a Series A preferred stock financing with third-party investors, at which time we acquired certain of LTI’s non-core intellectual property rights and other assets, all of which relate to our TFF technology, for 4,000,000 shares of our common stock. On February 14, 2022, LTI reported that it owned 2,235,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 8.8% of our capital stock. We are no longer a subsidiary of LTI.



Since our formation, we have focused on the development of our initial drug candidates, the establishment of strategic relationships with established pharmaceutical companies for the licensing of our TFF technology platform and the pursuit of additional working capital. We have not commenced revenue-producing operations. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “TFF Pharmaceuticals,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.



Since our organization in 2018, we have engaged in several capital raising transactions, which are summarized below in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – General.”



Overview



We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on our patented Thin Film Freezing, or TFF technology platform. We believe, and early testing confirms, that our TFF platform can significantly improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, a class of drugs that makes up approximately 33% of the major pharmaceuticals worldwide, thereby improving the pharmacokinetic effect of those drugs. We believe that in the case of some new drugs that cannot be developed due to poor water-solubility, our TFF platform has the potential to increase the pharmacokinetic effect of the drug to a level allowing for its development and commercialization.



As of the date of this report, we have two product candidates under development, TFF Voriconazole Inhalation Powder, or TFF Vori, and TFF Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder, or TFF Tac-Lac. In July 2020, we completed Phase I human clinical trials of our lead product, TFF Vori, and completed the enrollment of a Phase 1b clinical trial of TFF Vori in asthma patients in December 2021. Dosing of TFF Vori in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a Phase 2 clinical trial will begin in the first half of 2022. In September 2021, we completed Phase 1 human clinical trials of our TFF Tac-Lac product in Australia. Dosing of TFF Tac-Lac in lung transplant patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial will begin in the first half of 2022. In November 2021, we commenced dosing of TFF Niclosamide in a Phase 1 human clinical trial in Canada. We have not progressed the development of any other of our drug candidates to human clinical trials and our efforts have focused on the formulation, early-stage animal testing and formal toxicology studies of our initial drug candidates in preparation for our first clinical trials.



We also focused on the joint development of dry powder formulations of proprietary drugs owned or licensed by other pharmaceutical companies. As of the date of this report, we are engaged in the joint development of an inhaled SARS-CoV2 Monoclonal Antibody in collaboration with Augmenta BioWorks and a dry powder formulation of niclosamide in collaboration agreement with UNION therapeutics A/S. We are also actively engaged in the analysis and testing of dry powder formulations of several drugs and vaccines through topical, ocular and nasal applications pursuant to feasibility studies and material transfer agreements with U.S. and international pharmaceutical companies and certain government agencies.



We intend to initially focus on the development of inhaled dry powder drugs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases and conditions. While the TFF platform was designed to improve solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs generally, the researchers at University of Texas at Austin, or UT, found that the technology was particularly useful in generating dry powder particles with properties which allow for superior inhalation delivery, especially to the deep lung, which is an area of extreme interest in respiratory medicine. We believe that our TFF platform can significantly increase the number of pulmonary drug products that can be delivered by way of breath-actuated inhalers, which are generally considered to be the most effective and patient-friendly means of delivering medication directly to the lungs. Our dry powder drug products will be designed for use with dry powder inhalers, which are generally considered to be the most effective of all breath-actuated inhalers. We plan to focus on developing inhaled dry powder formulations of existing off-patent drugs intended for lung diseases and conditions, which we believe includes dozens of potential drug candidates, many of which have a potential market ranging from $100 million to over $500 million.

The Problem We Address



Solubility is an issue that all drugs must address. No matter how active or potentially active a new drug is against a particular molecular target, if the drug is not available in solution at the site of action, it is most likely not a viable development candidate. Based on independent third-party studies, 40% of newly discovered drugs have little or no water solubility, and in some therapeutic areas this number can reach 90%, which in most cases will prohibit development since most pharmaceutical companies cannot or will not conduct rigorous preclinical and clinical studies on a molecule that does not have a sufficient pharmacokinetic profile due to poor water solubility. Water solubility can also be an issue for some marketed drugs. Based on independent third-party studies, only two-thirds of the drugs on the World Health Organization, or WHO, Essential Drug List were classified as high solubility. A marketed drug with poor water solubility can show performance limitations, such as incomplete or erratic absorption, poor bioavailability, and slow onset of action. Effectiveness can vary from patient to patient, and there can be a strong effect of food on drug absorption. Finally, it may be necessary to increase the dose of a poorly soluble drug to obtain the efficacy required, which can lead to adverse side effects, toxicity issues and increased costs.



In addition to water solubility issues generally, certain drugs that target lung conditions and diseases have poor solubility that prevent them from being delivered by way of a breath-actuated inhaler and can only be given orally or intravenously. Breath actuated inhalers include dry powder inhalers, metered dose inhalers and nebulizers. A dry powder inhaler (such as the Advair Diskus) delivers drugs in a dry powder form directly to the lungs by way of a deep, fast breath on the mouth of the inhaler. A metered dose inhaler (such as the Symbicort asthma inhaler) uses propellant to push medication to the lungs. A nebulizer (such as the Aeroneb Pro) creates a mist that is breathed into the lungs through a mouthpiece. The dry powder inhaler is generally considered to be the most effective and convenient form of breath-actuated inhaler for all users, other than for those whose severe condition does not allow them to take a sufficiently deep breath.



We believe the primary benefit of a breath-actuated inhaler is its ability to administer a greater portion of the drug dosage directly to the target site. Dosing directly to the lungs has been shown to allow for better effect with fewer adverse events. In addition, it has been shown that dosing directly to the lungs requires a much lower dose of drug, sometimes as little as 10%, compared to delivery by oral or parenteral routes. While breath-actuated inhalers allow for a greater portion of the administered drug to reach the treatment site, which should allow for much smaller dosages compared to oral or intravenous delivery, not all drugs targeting lung conditions and diseases can be formulated for use with a breath-actuated inhaler. We believe there are dozens of off-patent drugs targeting lung conditions and diseases that are currently not eligible for delivery by way of breath-actuated inhalers, many of which have a potential market of $100 million to over $500 million. This is the market we intend to initially address through our development of dry powder drugs utilizing our TFF platform.



Our Thin Film Freezing Platform



Our development of dry powder drugs is enabled by technology licensed to us by the University of Texas at Austin, or UT. Researchers at UT have developed a technology employing a process called Thin Film Freezing, or TFF. While the TFF platform was designed to improve solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs generally, the researchers at UT found that the technology was particularly useful in generating dry powder particles with properties suitable for inhalation delivery, especially to the deep lung, an area of extreme interest in respiratory medicine. It was found that the TFF platform yields particles that are particularly well suited to dry powder inhaler delivery. The process results in a “Brittle Matrix Particle,” which possess low bulk density, high surface area, and typically an amorphous morphology, allowing them to supersaturate when contacting the target site, such as lung tissue. The aerodynamic properties of the particles are such that the portion of drug deposited to the deep lung may reach as high as 75% or greater of the administered dose, compared to 10% or less when given orally or intravenously.



The TFF process, outlined in the figures below, involves dissolving a drug or drugs in a solvent system, and it will often include agents designed to promote dispersion and avoid clumping and excipients to promote adhesion to the target site. The drug solution is then applied to a cryogenic substrate, such as a liquid nitrogen cooled stainless steel drum. When the drug solution contacts the cryogenic surface it vitrifies, or flash freezes, resulting in a “drug ice” typically with amorphous drug morphology. The solvent system is removed by lyophilization, resulting in Brittle Matrix Particles, shown in the photographs below, that are highly porous, large surface area, low-density particles. The process uses industry standard solvents, lung-approved excipients, a custom-made TFF drum and conventional process equipment.

We believe our TFF platform is a breakthrough platform technology for making dry powders from drugs which previously were not candidates for the dry powder inhaler or any breath-actuated inhaler. We believe our TFF technology opens the way for direct-to-lung delivery of dozens of pharmaceuticals, including the reformulation of existing drugs into a more safe and convenient inhaled dry powder product. We believe the technology can be used with molecules of all types and works with existing and off-the-shelf dry powder inhalers without the need for any additional equipment or devices.



We believe our TFF platform presents the following high value opportunities:




● | Reformulation of drugs for lung conditions. Today, many drugs intended for lung conditions are only given orally or intravenously due to properties that make them ill-suited for direct delivery by inhalers. Given by these routes, typically only 10% of the drug reaches the lungs, and these drugs may cause unwanted and even deadly side effects. We believe that our TFF platform for the first time will allow many of these medications to be formulated into the convenient, direct-to-lung dry powder inhaler format, thereby enhancing efficacy, reducing or eliminating side effects and providing for delivery of drug direct to the target site.

● | Biologics. Biopharmaceuticals (or biologics) are by far the fastest growing sector in the pharmaceutical industry today. According to Mordor Intelligence, the market for biologics was valued at approximately $302.6 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $509.2 billion by 2026. Biologics are most commonly delivered intravenously, and they can be an especially challenging class of drugs for formulation into a dry powder. We believe our TFF platform is uniquely suited to meet many of the challenges of biologic formulations, and our UT collaborators have demonstrated, via animal model testing and in vitro testing, the effectiveness of the TFF technology to produce dry powder biologics with up to 100% activity retained. We intend to explore dry powder forms of numerous biological drugs, including drugs intended to treat indications other than lung conditions and diseases. We are also pursuing TFF formulations of salt containing vaccines, which we believe may provide significant advantages over the traditional method of handling vaccines through liquid suspension and cold chain.

● | Combination Drugs. Combination drugs are products with two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients. In addition to providing for increased patient compliance with multiple medications, some drugs act synergistically and provide for superior benefit when given as a combination. However, combining pharmaceutical agents can be challenging, especially for inhalation delivery. Our TFF platform has shown the ability to produce fixed dose combinations of many agents in a manner that delivers the drugs simultaneously to the site of action in a precise amount.

UT initially licensed the TFF technology to The Dow Chemical Company, or Dow, and Dow researchers pursued the development of the TFF platform until Dow’s decision to divest its pharmaceutical assets in 2007. While at Dow, the technology was scaled from laboratory (milligrams) to pilot/commercial quantities (kilos). In addition, the Dow team showed that the scaling process did not alter the morphology or other properties of particles made using TFF. More than a dozen drugs, including both small molecules and biologics, were processed by Dow researchers and UT collaborators using the technology, and the benefits were quantified using both in vivo and analytical techniques. In a report published by Dow researchers in 2008, they reported that in several drugs tested by them, there was evidence of enhanced dissolution rates using the TFF platform compared to bulk drugs. In one instance, the researchers measured that a TFF prepared drug was able to reach 96% dissolution in two minutes compared to 60% dissolution in 30 minutes by the same drug in bulk form.



Following its decision to divest its pharmaceutical assets in 2007, Dow’s license rights to the TFF platform were terminated. In July 2015, UT granted to our former parent, LTI, an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for the TFF platform in all fields of use, other than vaccines, for which LTI was granted a non-exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for the TFF platform. In January 2018, we entered into a Contribution and Subscription Agreement with LTI, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire from LTI certain intellectual property rights and other assets, including the UT patent license agreement, all of which relate to our TFF platform. We closed on the acquisition of the LTI assets in March 2018. In November 2018, we and UT amended the UT patent license agreement pursuant to which, among other things, our exclusive patent rights to the TFF platform were expanded to all fields of use.



We continue to work with the inventors of the TFF platform through a series of Sponsored Research Agreements, or SRAs, with UT. Our SRAs with UT are industry standard sponsored research agreements pursuant to which UT provides to us certain product formulation, characterization and evaluation services with regard to our product candidates incorporating our TFF technology in exchange for our payment of UT’s expenses and reasonable overhead. The services conducted by UT are to be carried out under the direction of a principal investigator at UT who is the principal inventor of the TFF technology. The current SRA expires in April 2022 and is subject to renewal upon mutual agreement of the parties. As of the date of this report, we are engaged in talks with UT to extend the SRA. The SRAs includes customary provisions concerning confidentiality, indemnification and intellectual property rights, including each party’s exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed solely by them and the parties’ joint ownership of all intellectual property developed jointly. All patented intellectual property rights relating to the TFF technology developed solely or jointly by UT are subject to our patent license agreement with UT and are included among our licensed patent rights. Pursuant to those SRAs, the research scientists, together with their labs and collaborators, provide expertise and initial development work, including:

Our Internal Product Candidates



We intend to initially focus on the development of inhaled dry powder drugs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases and conditions. Our dry powder drug product candidates will be designed for use with dry powder inhalers, which are generally considered to be the most effective of all breath-actuated inhalers. We intend to develop dry powder drugs that can be used with existing dry powder inhalers that are commercially available without licensing. We plan to focus on developing dry powder drugs intended for lung diseases and conditions that are off-patent, which we believe includes dozens of potential drug candidates, many of which have a potential market ranging from $100 million to over $1 billion. As of the date of this report, we have identified and are focusing on three initial drug candidates and with each we are in the early stages of formulation and testing.

TFF Voriconazole Inhalation Powder, Vori – For the Treatment of Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis



We are developing an inhaled dry powder drug intended to treat invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, or IPA, a severe fungal pulmonary disease with a mortality rate that can reach 90% in some patient populations. IPA occurs primarily in patients with severe immunodeficiency, such as bone marrow transplant recipients, other transplant patients, patients with chemotherapy-induced immunodeficiency, and HIV patients. To date, the antifungals used to treat IPA have been delivered orally or intravenously. However, these delivery methods have resulted in low drug concentrations in the lung due to poor bioavailability. We believe these antifungals have serious side effects and drug interaction issues, which places a premium on any solution that can provide effective treatment in more limited dosages. Due to the nature of these drugs, it has not been possible to make formulations for breath-actuated inhalers that might maximize lung concentration while limiting side effects.



We believe, and our preclinical studies and clinical trials to date confirm, that our TFF platform can be used to formulate a dry powder version of Voriconazole, generally considered to be one of the best antifungal drugs used in the treatment of IPA. Voriconazole is an off-patent drug and our TFF prepared version of Voriconazole would represent the first inhaled antifungal medication for the treatment of IPA, which has the potential to put the drug exactly where it is needed while minimizing off target effects.



Voriconazole is currently marketed in Australia, Europe and the U.S. as Vfend, and is available in several strengths and presentations for oral delivery or IV infusion. As of the date of this report, the Clinical Practice Guidelines released by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend Voriconazole as first-line monotherapy for IPA. However, since the registration of Vfend in Europe and the U.S. in 2002, several studies have examined the exposure-response relationship with Voriconazole, identifying a relationship between low Voriconazole exposure and higher rates of treatment failure, as well as a higher propensity for neurotoxicity at higher exposures. Studies have shown that when delivered orally or intravenously Voriconazole can have differing bioavailability, and therefore differing concentration of the drug available to the lungs, based on whether the patient recently had food. In addition, Voriconazole when delivered orally or intravenously has been shown to have various side effects including nausea and headaches, and adverse events including optic neuritis and papilledema, hepatic toxicity, galactose intolerance, arrhythmias and QT prolongation. These studies confirm that when administered orally or intravenously, Voriconazole provides a narrow therapeutic window between treatment failure and unacceptable treatment toxicity.



We believe a TFF prepared dry powder formulation of Voriconazole can maximize both the prophylactic value to the lungs for immunocompromised patients susceptible to IPA and the treatment value of patients suffering from chronic IPA. We also believe our dry powder drug would benefit patients by providing the drug at the “port of entry” of invasive fungal infections, while also reducing or eliminating the unpleasant and potentially fatal side effects associated with Voriconazole and other last line antifungals. We also believe that the administration of our TFF prepared dry powder formulation directly to the lungs will significantly reduce any potential differences in bioavailability due to the effects of eating or fasting. In addition, animal and in vitro studies have shown that our TFF prepared dry powder formulation will improve the solubility of Voriconazole compared to oral or intravenous delivery. We believe that the combination of improved solubility and direct-to-lung administration of our TFF prepared dry powder formulation will allow for a lower dose directly to the lungs and thereby reduce the high systemic exposure of oral administration and associated side effects, including optic neuritis and papilledema, hepatic toxicity, galactose intolerance, arrhythmias and QT prolongation.



Through our work with UT, we successfully conducted preclinical testing of a TFF formulation of Voriconazole in 2018. In February 2019, we participated in a pre-IND meeting with the FDA for purposes of discussing our proposed regulatory pathway for TFF Vori and obtaining guidance from the FDA on the pre-clinical plan leading to the filing and acceptance of an IND application for TFF Vori. We were successful in gaining agreement that a 505(b)(2) approach would be appropriate for TFF Vori. In October 2019, we submitted to the FDA an IND for our TFF Vori and initiated our Phase I human clinical trials in November 2019. We completed the clinical portion of our Phase 1 trial in July 2020 and progressed to a Phase 1b clinical trial in asthma patients in November 2020, which completed dosing in December 2021. We have initiated activities to gain regulatory approval for a Phase 2 clinical trial of TFF Vori and we expect to begin enrolling patients in the first half of 2022. We believe that subject to a successful completion of a single well-controlled and adequately powered study, we will be able to file FDA marketing approval. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not ask for additional clinical data. We also believe that our dry powder formulation may qualify as an orphan drug, as there are an estimated 50,000 transplant patients and an additional 30,000 or more acute leukemia patients in the U.S. each year that are at risk of developing IPA, as well as approximately 50,000 patients suffering with IPA.

TFF Tacrolimus Inhalation Powder, Tac-Lac — For Immunosuppression to Prevent Organ Transplant Rejection



We are developing TFF Tac-Lac, a dry powder version of Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant medicine. Prograf Tacrolimus is currently the second most commonly administered immunosuppressive agent in solid organ transplantation despite what we believe to be the many challenges for patients and physicians when used for extended periods. Prograf Tacrolimus can cause nephrotoxicity, particularly when used in high doses. According to product labeling and prescribing information for Prograf Tacrolimus, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 52% of kidney transplantation patients and in 40% and 36% of liver transplantation patients receiving Prograf in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively, and in 59% of heart transplantation patients in a European randomized trial.



Although Tacrolimus has been shown via animal models to be beneficial for a number of immunological diseases that affect the lung, systemic toxicity (including renal failure, hypertension, hirsutism, diabetes) has limited its use. In addition, Tacrolimus when delivered orally or intravenously has been shown to have side effects including nausea, indigestion, stomach pain and headaches. Adverse events associated with Tacrolimus when delivered orally or intravenously include increase in cancer, increase in infections, anemia, kidney problems, nervous system problems (including seizures, coma, tremors, confusion, headaches), high blood pressure, QT prolongation, high level of potassium in the blood, myocardial hypertrophy, diabetes, damage to the brain, high level of fats or lipids or phosphates in the blood, constipation, diarrhea, bronchitis, inability to sleep, low magnesium levels, reduction in white blood cells, lack of energy, damage to the peripheral nerves, and fluid around the heart.



Tacrolimus is an off-patent drug and we intend to develop a dry powder version suitable for use with a dry powder inhaler. Because our dry powder version would provide for a high local lung concentration without the typical systemic toxicity frequently experienced with oral dosage form immunosuppressants, we believe our drug candidate should have a high likelihood of success in competing in the immunosuppressant market for lung and heart/lung transplants.



Through our partners at UT, we successfully conducted preclinical testing of our dry powder formulation of Tacrolimus in 2018. In September 2019, we participated in a pre-IND meeting with the FDA for purposes of discussing our proposed regulatory pathway for TFF Tac-Lac and obtaining guidance from the FDA on the pre-clinical plan leading to the filing and acceptance of an IND application for TFF Tac-Lac. We were successful in gaining agreement that a 505(b)(2) approach would be appropriate for TFF Tac-Lac. In September 2021, we completed a Phase 1 human clinical trial of TFF Tac-Lac. We have initiated activities to gain regulatory approval for a Phase 2 clinical trial of TFF Tac-Lac and we expect to begin enrolling patients in the first half of 2022. As of the date of this report, we intend to submit to the FDA an IND for TFF Tac-Lac when we initiate Phase 2 clinical trials.



Other Potential Dry Powder Products



Our business model is to develop proprietary innovative drug product candidates that offer commercial or functional advantages, or both, to currently available alternatives. In our initial evaluation of the market, we have identified a number of potential drug candidates that show promise upon initial assessment, for two of which we have conducted meaningful development activities, including dry powder formulations of:

Cannabidiol, or CBD, a controlled substance as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, that is reported to be used by some for the treatment of various epilepsy syndromes as well as anxiety, insomnia, and different types of pain. We are in the early stages of developing an inhaled dry powder drug that could be used to support or to treat a variety of health issues that may benefit from CBD administration. Researchers have explored using the broader class of cannabinoids for inflammation, symptoms of multiple sclerosis, anorexia, schizophrenia, and other conditions. The FDA has approved Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age or older. The Epidiolex product is an oral solution containing 100 mg/mL of CBD.



We believe, and early in-vitro research confirms, that our TFF platform can be used to formulate a dry powder version of CBD. Through our work with UT, early animal model testing of TFF formulations of CBD administered via inhalation have been completed. The inhaled CBD showed more sustained pharmacokinetic blood levels compared to the IV delivery method in the animal studies.



We intend to engage pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical companies in the CBD space in discussions concerning a potential joint development of our dry powder formulation of CBD, which may target a CBD drug product subject to FDA regulation or a non-drug CBD product that may not be subject to FDA approval. We do not intend to pursue the development of our dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product beyond performance characterization and efficacy data through early animal testing until such time, if ever, as we obtain a drug development partner. There can be no assurance that our early testing and development will lead to a commercial dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product.



The 2018 Farm Bill, which was signed into law on December 20, 2018, liberalized to some degree the regulation of hemp and hemp-derived products, such as CBDs, under the CSA. However, the 2018 Farm Bill did not alter the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. Following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA reaffirmed its enforcement authority and reiterated the requirement that a CBD product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. However, we believe that CBD products that are not marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, and meet the requirements of a dietary supplement, may not require FDA pre-marketing approval. Hemp products, including CBDs, that qualify as drugs, food, dietary supplements, veterinary products, and cosmetics will continue to be regulated by the FDA under the applicable regulatory frameworks. As of the date of this report, we believe that Epidiolex is the only CBD-based product that has received market approval from the FDA



Vaccines containing aluminum salts, which make up approximately 35% of all vaccines. Aluminum salts are incorporated into many vaccine formulations as an adjuvant, which is a substance added to vaccines to enhance the immune response of vaccinated individuals. A major limitation with these vaccines is that they are very fragile and to maintain their efficacy they must be formulated as liquid suspensions and kept in a cold chain (2–8°C) during transport and storage, which is burdensome and expensive. Also, exposure of the liquid vaccines to either ambient or freezing temperatures will cause a loss of efficacy, including particle aggregation in the case of freezing. Alternatives to cold chain have been examined, including the introduction of stabilizing agents in vaccines to prevent aggregation during freezing and the application of novel freezing and drying techniques; however, we believe that to date none of these techniques have led to an acceptable alternative to cold chain



We have conducted drug and performance characterization activities of certain TFF formulated salt containing vaccines. Our activities suggest that the salt containing vaccines can be successfully converted from liquid suspension into dry powder using our TFF platform using a relatively low concentration of trehalose as an excipient, and that the dry powder can later be reconstituted at the time of use without causing particle aggregation or decrease in efficacy. In addition, the dry vaccine powder did not aggregate after repeated dry-freezing-and-thawing. We believe that the TFF platform may be used to formulate new vaccines, or to reformulate existing vaccines, that are adjuvanted with aluminum salts into dry vaccine powder without significant loss of efficacy.



We intend to engage pharmaceutical companies in the vaccine space in discussions concerning a potential joint development of TFF formulated salt containing vaccines and, in the meantime, we do not intend to pursue the development of our dry powder formulation of salt containing vaccines beyond performance characterization and efficacy data through early animal testing until such time, if ever, as we obtain a development partner. There can be no assurance, however, that our early testing and development will lead to a commercial dry powder formulation of salt containing vaccines.

Other Potential Product Candidates. We have identified a number of additional drug candidates that show promise upon initial evaluation. In each case, these are drugs for which we would directly pursue the development of a dry powder formulation for use through a dry powder inhaler. We have not commenced meaningful development activities for any of these product candidates at this time and there can be no assurance that we will pursue any of the product candidates below.




Candidate | Intervention | Indication 
-----------------------------+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapamycin | Acute Treatment | Lymphangioleiomyomatosis 
Alpha-1-antitrypsin | Chronic Treatment | Vitamin A deficiency 
GM-CSF (filgrastim) | Treatment | Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
Treprostinil | Treatment | Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) | Acute Treatment | Cancer: Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer, Liver, brain, melanoma, metastatic 
Cisplatin | Acute Treatment | Lung or esophageal cancer 
Gemcitabine | Acute Treatment | Lung or esophageal cancer 
Isoniazid/Rifampicin | Acute Treatment | Tuberculosis 
Amphotericin B | Acute Treatment | Antifungal 
Palivizumab | Prophylaxis | Tuberculosis 
Ciprofloxacin | Acute Treatment | Infection 
Tobramycin | Acute Treatment | Infection 
Azithromycin | Acute Treatment | Infection 
Calcium channel blockers | Acute Treatment | Raynaud’s disease 
Sumatriptin | Acute Treatment | Migraine 
Stem cells | Lung remodeling | Pneumococcal pneumonia; cardiomyopathy 




We believe that our TFF technology provides a very diverse and effective way to develop solutions for lung specific disorders. Many potentially beneficial drugs for lung diseases and disorders are unable to be dosed in high enough concentration to provide therapeutic benefit to the lung due to the systemic nature (oral or IV dosing) of the drug leading to toxicity of the kidney, lungs and other systemic safety concerns. We believe our TFF platform has the potential to take these difficult to formulate drugs and develop products to be delivered directly to the lung for treatment of lung diseases and disorders. This direct dosing may reduce plasma levels and has the potential to increase efficacy while reducing side effects.



We believe that all of the above potential drug candidates are off-patent drugs for which we would directly pursue the development of a dry powder formulation through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. However, not all of our drug product candidates will target off-patent drugs. For example, we do not expect our proposed dry powder formulation of CBD to be off-patent and our proposed dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines may not be off-patent. We also expect that our dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product will likely require a full NDA through the FDA’s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway and that our dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines will require a biological license application, or BLA, which is very similar to a full NDA through the FDA’s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway.



Our business model includes the development proprietary innovative drug product candidates that offer commercial or functional advantages, or both, to currently available alternatives. Because our initial dry powder drug candidates, TFF Vori and TFF Tac-Lac, will be established drugs that are off-patent, we believe that our initial drug product candidates will qualify for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and in corresponding regulatory paths in other foreign jurisdictions. The 505(b)(2) pathway sometimes does not require clinical trials other than a bioequivalence trial. However, to the extent we claim that our product candidates target a new indication or offer improved safety compared to the existing approved products, and it is our present expectation that we will in many cases, it is likely that we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval. For example, and as more fully described below, based on a February 2019 pre-Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, meeting with the FDA concerning TFF Vori, we believe we will need to conduct Phase I and Phase II studies prior to filing for marketing approval for TFF Vori. In addition, based on a September 2019 pre-IND meeting with the FDA concerning TFF Tac-Lac, we also believe we will require Phase I and Phase IIb/IIIa studies prior to filing for marketing approval for TFF Tac-Lac. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not ask for additional clinical data for either TFF Vori or TFF Tac-Lac.

While we intend to target the development of off-patent drugs for which we would directly pursue the development of a dry powder formulation through the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, not all of our product candidates will target off-patent drugs and, at least in the case of a dry powder formulation of cannabidiol, or CBD, our product candidate may not be a drug. We do not expect our proposed dry powder formulation of CBD drug product to be off-patent and our proposed dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines may not be off-patent. We also expect that our dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product will likely require a full New Drug Application, or NDA, through the FDA’s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway; however, a non-pharmaceutical CBD dry powder formulation, such as a dietary supplement, may not require FDA pre-market approval. We expect that our dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines will require a biological license application, or BLA, which is very similar to a full NDA through the FDA’s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway.



We also believe that in some cases our dry powder drug products may qualify for the FDA’s orphan drug status. Upon and subject to receipt of the requisite approvals, we intend to commercialize our drug product candidates through a combination of our internal direct sales and third-party marketing and distribution partnerships. In some cases, such as the development of combination drugs or the development of dry powder formulations of patented drugs, we intend to pursue the licensing of our TFF platform or a joint development arrangement.



Our Intended Regulatory Pathway



The 505(b)(2) pathway is intended for molecules that have been previously approved by the FDA or have already been proven to be safe and effective. A 505(b)(2) product reformulates the known molecule in a new strength or dosage form. 505(b)(2) products have the advantage of potentially significantly lower development costs and shorter development timelines versus traditional new molecular entities. We expect to utilize the 505(b)(2) pathway for all of our current product candidates.



A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. A 505(b)(2) product candidate might rely on the clinical studies or literature of a previously FDA-approved drug, or rely on the literature and physician usage of an FDA-unapproved, or DESI, drug. The clinical requirements for a 505(b)(2) drug candidate can vary widely from product to product and may include new clinical trials, bioequivalence trials, limited safety and efficacy trials, or full Phase I through III trials. Unless the FDA has released a guidance document, the clinical requirement for a new product candidate is typically not known until the drug sponsor has a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA. We believe there is a significant opportunity to pursue dry powder formulations of off-patent drugs using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.



We also believe that in some cases the indication for some of our dry powder drug product candidates may qualify for the FDA’s orphan drug status. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition generally affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation provides for seven years of exclusivity, independent of patent protection, to the company that brings a particular orphan drug to market. In addition, companies developing orphan drugs are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated.



Our Joint Development Collaborations and Licensing Activities



We also focused on the joint development of dry powder formulations of proprietary drugs owned or licensed by other pharmaceutical companies. As of the date of this report, we are engaged in the joint development of an inhaled SARS-CoV2 Monoclonal Antibody in collaboration with Augmenta BioWorks and a dry powder formulation of niclosamide in collaboration agreement with UNION therapeutics A/S. We are also actively engaged in the analysis and testing of dry powder formulations of several drugs and vaccines through topical, ocular and nasal applications pursuant to feasibility studies and material transfer agreements with U.S. and international pharmaceutical companies and certain government agencies.

Inhaled SARS-CoV2 Monoclonal Antibody (Joint development with Augmenta BioWorks)



On November 2, 2020, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Augmenta BioWorks pursuant to which we and Augmenta agreed to work jointly to develop one or more dry powder formulations of Augmenta’s human derived monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Initially, we and Augmenta are working jointly to develop an inhaled dry powder form of a sars-cov2 monoclonal, or mAb, using our proprietary TFF process. The proprietary mAb in this formulation was identified by Augmenta and has demonstrated potent binding and neutralization activity against the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. Recent Emergency Use Authorizations of anti-SARS-CoV2-mAbs delivered by intravenous infusion have been achieved by Regeneron and Eli Lilly. Early testing confirmed that our TFF platform can be used to formulate a dry powder mAb for inhalation delivery. We believe a TFF prepared anti-SARS-CoV2-mAb administered directly to the lungs can maximize the early outpatient treatment of patients with COVID-19 infections who are at risk for serious disease complications while minimizing the amount of antibody required to achieve efficacious dose.



Pursuant to the Joint Development Agreement, or JDA, we and Augmenta will share development costs, with each party funding its fifty-percent-share at specified times. In the event that one of the parties fails to make its pro rata share payment, the other party may terminate the JDA. In lieu of terminating the JDA, the non-defaulting party may elect to continue the JDA by paying the delinquent amount and each party’s pro rata share of the JDA will automatically adjust by the amount paid. In addition, in the event Augmenta experiences a default on its required payment, Augmenta will have the one-time right to elect to require us to purchase Augmenta’s interest in the JDA for a one-time fee of $500,000. Upon exercise of the put right and payment by us, Augmenta will grant us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to the Augmenta antibody and Augmenta’s rights to the property developed under the JDA.



Niclosamide Inhalation Powder (Joint Development with UNION therapeutics A/S)



On August 12, 2020, we entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with UNION therapeutics A/S in which UNION acquired an option to obtain a worldwide exclusive license for the TFF technology in combination with niclosamide. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, UNION can exercise its option to obtain the license within 45 days after the complete data has been received by UNION from investigator-initiated trials. Upon exercise of the option, UNION shall be responsible to pay all expenses incurred in the development of any licensed product. We will be eligible to receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones in the development the licensed products, based on completion of clinical trials, pre-marketing approvals and/or the receipt of at least $25,000,000 of grant funding. We will receive a single-digit tiered royalty on net sales, and will also be entitled to receive sales-related milestone payments based on the commercial success of the licensed products.



Niclosamide has been used to treat tapeworm infections in humans since the 1960s and was recently reported to be one of the most potent approved drugs in screens for antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease. Early testing confirmed that our TFF platform can be used to formulate a dry powder version of Niclosamide, which is no longer subject to patent protection. We believe a TFF prepared dry powder formulation of Niclosamide administered directly to the lungs can maximize both the early outpatient treatment of patients with COVID-19 infections who are at risk for serious disease complications and for prophylactic use for persons exposed to COVID-19. Under the license agreement, we are responsible for the conduct of investigator-initiated clinical studies of the TFF dry powder formulation of niclosamide and in November 2021 we commenced dosing in a Phase 1 human clinical trial of the TFF Niclosamide product in Canada



Manufacturing



We have entered into short-term contract manufacturing agreements with IriSys, Inc. CoreRx, Inc. and Experic for their provision of certain product testing, development and preclinical and clinical manufacturing services for our TFF Vori and TFF Tac-Lac product candidates, respectively. Our agreements with IriSys, CoreRx and Experic include customary provisions concerning confidentiality, indemnification and intellectual property rights, including our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed severally or jointly relating to our TFF technology. We have not entered into agreements with any contract manufacturers for the commercial supply, however, we believe that IriSys, CoreRx and Experic, among several other manufacturers, have the experience and the capacity to serve as a commercial contract manufacturer. We believe we will be able to engage a commercial contract manufacturer for our product candidates in a timely manner at competitive pricing.



Each of CoreRx’s, IriSys’ and Experic’s facilities and services are conducted in accordance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, regulations.




10







Pursuant to the agreements with CoreRx, IriSys and Experic, they will generate clinical supplies and provide release and stability testing of the respective TFF drug product candidate. Specific tasks will include:




● | Engineering review and TFF technology installation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Familiarization with TFF technology, including powder processing and handling; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analytical method transfer, development, and validation; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting process development trials and short-term supportive stability analysis; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Scale-up and demonstration batches of the product candidate; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacture and analytical characterization of materials to support toxicology studies, both, placebo and active; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Process train qualification for cGMP manufacturing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacturing and release of cGMP batches for clinical trials; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting formal stability study under the guidelines of International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Because our dry powder drug candidates will represent a new formulation of an existing drug, we will need to obtain FDA approval of the TFF prepared drug candidate before we can begin commercialization. However, because we begin our formulation with a drug that has previously received FDA approval in another form, we believe that in most cases we should qualify for the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which potentially will take less time and investment than the standard FDA approval process.



Licenses and Intellectual Property Rights



We hold rights to our TFF technology pursuant to a patent license agreement entered into in July 2015, between University of Texas at Austin, or UT, and our former parent, LTI, which LTI assigned to us in March 2018, as amended by UT and us on November 30, 2018. UT is the owner of 127 U.S. and international patents and patent applications with claims covering the TFF platform. Pursuant to the amended patent license agreement, we hold an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the rights to the aforementioned patents, including any divisionals, continuations and extensions, in all fields of use. We have also filed four US and foreign patent applications relating to certain elements of the thin film freezing platform.]



We are required to pay royalties to UT in the amount of 2% of net sales received by us from the sale of products covered by the licensed patent rights. We will also be required to make certain milestone payments to UT in connection with the certain regulatory submissions and approvals and pay fees in connection with any assignments or sublicenses, including:




● | $50,000 upon each approval of an IND for the first indication of each product candidate; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $100,000 upon submission of a final Phase II report (or a foreign equivalent) on the first product candidate; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $250,000 upon submission of a final Phase III report (or a foreign equivalent) on the first product candidate; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $500,000 upon regulatory approval in the U.S. (or a foreign equivalent) on the first product candidate; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | $500,000 upon regulatory approval in the U.S. (or a foreign equivalent) on the second product candidate or on the second indication of the first product candidate; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our issuance to UT of one percent (1%) of our outstanding common stock, calculated on a fully-diluted basis, upon and as of our first IND approval for a product candidate. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





11







Pursuant to the UT patent license agreement, UT has agreed to consult with us concerning the development and implementation of a strategy for the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights, including any infringement of the licensed patents rights by third-parties. However, UT has retained control and final decision-making authority over such matters. We are responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses involved in the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights and are obligated to negotiate in good faith with UT over the funding and allocation of any recovery involved in any patent infringement action brought to enforce the licensed patent rights, which are presently scheduled to expire over a period of time commencing in 2023 and ending in 2035. The term of the UT patent license agreement is co-terminus with the licensed patent rights. However, UT has the right to terminate the patent license agreement, or any part of the licensed patent rights or field of use, in the event of our breach of any provision of the patent license agreement that remains uncured after UT’s written notice of breach and an applicable cure period or in the event we initiate any proceeding to challenge the validity or scope of the licensed patent rights. The agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities by the parties.



In addition to the licensed patent rights, we also rely on our trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We will vigorously defend our intellectual property to preserve our rights and gain the benefit of our technological investments.



Government Regulations and Funding



Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by foreign, federal, state and local agencies, such as the U.S. FDA, and various similar agencies in most countries worldwide. The manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are subject to government regulation in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Additionally, in the U.S., we must follow rules and regulations established by the FDA requiring the presentation of data indicating that our product candidates are safe and efficacious and are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our product candidates, and we may be criminally prosecuted. We, our manufacturers and clinical research organizations, may also be subject to regulations under other foreign, federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. The U.S. government has increased its enforcement activity regarding illegal marketing practices domestically and internationally. As a result, pharmaceutical companies must ensure their compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.



These regulatory requirements impact our operations and differ from one country to another, so that securing the applicable regulatory approvals of one country does not imply the approval of another country. The approval procedures involve high costs and are manpower intensive, usually extend over many years and require highly skilled and professional resources.



FDA Market Approval Process



The steps usually required to be taken before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally include:




● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of required chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be evaluated and found acceptable by the FDA before human clinical trials may commence; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission and approval of an NDA; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | successful pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer and analytical testing facilities; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | agreement with FDA of the label language, including the prescribing information insert. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, what types of patients may enter the study, schedules of tests and procedures, drugs, dosages, and length of study, as well as the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND process.



Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase I clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety and tolerability of various dosing regimens and pharmacokinetics. After a safe dose has been established, in Phase II clinical trials the drug is administered to small populations of sick patients to look for initial signs of efficacy via dose ranging studies in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess safety and the effective doses to be studied in larger trials in Phase III. In the case of vaccines, the participants are healthy and the signs of efficacy can be obtained in early Phase I, therefore this Phase is defined as Phase I/II. Phase III clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in hundreds or even thousands of subjects at various sites to assess as fully as possible both the safety and effectiveness of the drug.



Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board, or IRB, generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites that the IRB oversees and also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group recommends whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical study sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.



As a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases, manufacturing processes are further defined, refined, controlled and validated. The level of control and validation required by the FDA increases as clinical studies progress. We and the third-party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components (including the API) are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMPs. To comply with cGMP requirements, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel, facilities, equipment, production and process, labeling and packaging, quality control, recordkeeping and other requirements.



Assuming completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications, together with payment of a user fee, unless waived. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA also conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer and laboratory prior to approval of the NDA.



If an NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA’s goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within ten months of submission, unless the application relates to an unmet medical need, or is for a serious or life-threatening indication, in which case the goal may be within six months of NDA submission. However, PDUFA goal dates are not legal mandates and the FDA response often occurs several months beyond the original PDUFA goal date. Further, the review process and the target response date under PDUFA may be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the NDA. The NDA review process can, accordingly, be very lengthy. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA and/or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the applicant.




13







After the FDA evaluates the NDA and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced and tested, it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the NDA. If the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data, the FDA nevertheless may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing. Such post-marketing testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and efficacy after approval. Regulatory approval of products for serious or life-threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.



If the FDA approves one of our product candidates, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval regulatory requirements. We would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our product candidates. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. If we seek to make certain changes to an approved product, such as certain manufacturing changes, we may need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented.



While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. Securing FDA approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires, among other things, submitting data from adequate and well-controlled studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. Even if such studies are conducted, the FDA may not approve any change in a timely fashion, or at all.



The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, or Phase IV testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions or an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.



Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications



We intend to submit applications for both of our lead therapeutic candidates via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.



The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).



To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. If the Orange Book certifications outlined above are not accomplished, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized.




14







Orphan Drugs



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation (ODD) provides for seven years of market exclusivity, independent of patent protection, to the company with ODD that brings a particular product to market. In addition, companies developing orphan drugs are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated.



To gain exclusivity, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to the orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug’s showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In addition, doctors may prescribe products for off-label uses and undermine our exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same active moiety for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior.



We may plan to pursue orphan drug designation and exclusivity for some of our product candidates in the United States, European Union, and other geographies of interest for specific products. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation for any products in any jurisdiction. Even if we are able to obtain orphan drug designation for a product, we cannot be sure that such product will be approved, that we will be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, if ever, or that we will be able to maintain any exclusivity that is granted.



Continuing Regulation



After a drug is approved for marketing and enters the marketplace, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include, but are not limited to:




● | the FDA’s cGMP regulations require manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of a drug product; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits during promotion of the drug; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of product modifications or use of a drug for an indication other than approved in an NDA; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adverse drug experience regulations, which require us to report information on adverse events during pre-market testing and post-approval safety reporting; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NDA quarterly reporting for the first three years, then annual reporting thereafter, of changes in chemistry, manufacturing and control or CMC, labeling, clinical studies and findings, and toxicology studies from the data submitted in the NDA; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market testing and surveillance requirements, including Phase IV trials, when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the drug; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, drug manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulation. After a drug receives approval, any modification in conditions of use, active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, strength or bioavailability, will require a new approval, for which it may be possible to submit a 505(b)(2), accompanied by additional clinical data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product with the proposed changes. Additional clinical studies may be required for proposed changes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements



For products distributed in the United States, we will also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

Reimbursement



Sales of our product candidates in the United States may depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the product candidates will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and includes a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for product candidates for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our product candidates covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.



On February 17, 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was signed into law. This law provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear how such a result could be avoided and what if any effect the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidates and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
