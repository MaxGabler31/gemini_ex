Item 1. Business
History and Organization
 
We were incorporated on December 27, 2010 as ATVROCKN, a Nevada corporation. On June 20, 2017, our corporate name was changed to Ameritek Ventures. We consider ourselves to be a smaller reporting company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. (See “Implications of Being an ‘Emerging Growth Company’ ” below in this Section. Under our original business plan, it was our intention to market a "housing molding" product to place audio equipment and lighting on 4-wheel drive vehicles such as All Terrain Vehicles (“ATV”) and Utility Terrain Vehicles (“UTV”). We did not manufacture any units as we utilized the services of a contract manufacturer to make the unit for us. We had no material agreement with our contract manufacturer other than we paid them to produce product for us based on our needs. As we were undercapitalized, we were unable to produce the required housing molding(s) we believe would best sell in the ATV/UTV aftermarket.
 
In August 2017, the Company completed its move into a new production and design facility in Roanoke, Virginia. On August 30, 2017, the Company acquired fiber optic assets from its largest shareholder and director. In this facility the Company will be finalizing design work for its first 5 million km/year VAD/OVD (Vapor Axial Deposition/Outside Vapor Deposition) optical fiber preform production line, slated for assembly, testing and production in 2019. This process makes optical fiber preforms that are the mainstay for fiber optic cable that is used in the telecommunications industry to transmit large amounts of data to and from communication towers for the internet, cable television and telephone industries. This new VAD/OVD production line represents the first phase of a planned 20 million km/year preform manufacturing facility. Ameritek Ventures’ brand-new design and technology hub will help execute the Company's sustained growth and emergence strategy as a provider of high-quality optical fiber preforms for the rapidly expanding Fiber Optic Cable worldwide market that in the past has been dominated by firms like Corning Incorporated, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Prysmian SpA, Jiangsu Fasten Co. Ltd and Fujikura Ltd.
 
Implications of Being an “Smaller Reporting Company”
 
Certain reduced reporting requirements and exemptions are available to us due to the fact that we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.
 
Investors should be aware that we will be subject to the "Penny Stock" rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in Penny Stocks. These regulations may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for our stock, and investors in our common stock may find it difficult to sell their shares.

Business of Issuer
 
In August 2017, the Company completed its move into a new production and design facility in Roanoke, Virginia. In this facility the Company will be finalizing design work for its first 5 million km/year VAD/OVD (Vapor Axial Deposition/Outside Vapor Deposition) optical fiber preform production line, slated for assembly, testing and production in 2019. This process makes optical fiber preforms that are the mainstay for fiber optic cable that is used in the telecommunications industry to transmit large amounts of data to and from communication towers for the Internet, cable television and telephone industries.

Ameritek Ventures’ brand-new design and technology hub will help execute the Company's sustained growth and emergence strategy as a provider of high-quality optical fiber preforms for the rapidly expanding Fiber Optic Cable worldwide market that in the past has been dominated by firms like Corning Incorporated, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Prysmian SpA, Jiangsu Fasten Co. Ltd and Fujikura Ltd.
Market Size
 
The current market value of the optical fiber industry is $3 billion US dollars and is projected to grow to over $5 billion US dollars by 2021. An increase of almost 10,000 tons of perform is projected in the next five years, which is equivalent to more than 300 million kilometers per year of performs.
Competition
 
We will be involved in intense competition with other business entities, many of which will have a competitive edge over us by virtue of their more substantial financial resources and prior experience in business. Some examples include firms like Corning Incorporated, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd., Prysmian SpA, Jiangsu Fasten Co. Ltd and Fujikura Ltd. We also face numerous other smaller companies at the same stage of development as we are.
Patents, Trademarks Licenses and Other Intellectual Property
 
On August 30, 2017, the Company acquired fiber optic assets, in the form of intellectual property from its largest shareholder and director. These assets consist of proven designs that in the future may be used to fabricate and assemble machines incorporating knowledge from the manufacture of completed equipment for a new PCVD (Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition) technology that is used in the manufacturing of specialty optical fiber preforms, which is the basis for specialized optical fiber production to satisfy a variety of fiber optic cable applications. Prior to building any PCVD machines, the Company will be using this intellectual property in finalizing design work for its first 5 million km/year VAD/OVD (Vapor Axial Deposition/Outside Vapor Deposition) optical fiber preform production line, slated for assembly, testing and production in 2019. This process makes optical fiber preforms that are the mainstay for fiber optic cable that is used in the telecommunications industry to transmit large amounts of data to and from communication towers for the Internet, cable television and telephone industries.
