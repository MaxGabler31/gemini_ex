Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
AccuStem Sciences, Inc.(the “Company”) is a life sciences company focused on improving outcomes for patients with cancer. Our plan is to develop and commercialize a variety of products in the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and medical device spaces that enable more informed treatment planning and more effective treatment options for patients. Our initial approach will be the commercialization of a proprietary genomic platform, StemPrint, for recurrence risk stratification of different types of cancer. StemPrint was developed to measure the “stemness” of tumors, or how likely a cancer is to recur or be resistant to standard treatments, which could impact how patients are managed in oncology clinics. To augment this unique offering we also plan to provide ancillary commodity testing (e.g., hereditary genetic testing, somatic mutation testing) to provide additional information and value to our clients.
 
Our primary product candidate is StemPrintER, a 20-gene prognostic assay intended for the prediction of the risk of distant recurrence (“DR”) in luminal, ER+/HER2-negative breast cancer patients. StemPrintER has been validated in several retrospective cohorts and studies, the largest of which are a consecutive series of approximately 2,400 patients from the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) and approximately 800 patients from the TransATAC study. These studies all confirm that StemPrintER is highly prognostic for outcomes in patients with breast cancer and indicate the potential utility of the test in the oncology clinic.
 
Company History and Acquisition
 
AccuStem Sciences Limited was created in connection with its demerger (spin-off) from Tiziana Life Sciences plc (“Tiziana”) and the AccuStem Sciences Limited was incorporated in England and Wales on June 5, 2020 as a private company with limited liability under the Companies Act with indefinite life and company number 12647178. The demerger was conditional upon, among other things, court approval of a Tiziana capital reduction, which was approved by special resolution of Tiziana’s shareholders on October 2, 2020. The court sanctioned the related Tiziana capital reduction on October 27, 2020, and the demerger became effective on October 30, 2020. We have re-registered as a public limited company if and when we may apply to have our shares traded on NASDAQ.
 
The demerger agreement provides for the transfer by Tiziana to us of the entire issued share capital of StemPrintER Sciences Limited (“StemPrintER”), the Tiziana entity to which Tiziana contributed all of the assets and intellectual property relating to the StemPrintER and SPARE projects and $1,353,373 (£1,000,000) in cash. The demerger consideration will be satisfied by the Company’s allocation and issuance of the new shares directly to Tiziana’s shareholders.

For the purposes of the demerger, Tiziana first transferred the assets relating to the StemPrintER project and the SPARE project (primarily the benefit of the license from IEO/University of Milan and an outsourced research program) to a separate company, StemPrintER, together with $1,353,373 (£1,000,000) in cash. As a result of this step, StemPrintER became an operating entity. In the next step, Tiziana transferred StemPrintER’s shares to us in return for shares to Tiziana’s shareholders, on a one for one basis, and Tiziana declared a dividend in specie to its shareholders of those shares.
 
The objective of the demerger was to maximize value to Tiziana’s shareholders through the further commercialization of the StemPrintER project by transferring Tiziana’s interest in the StemPrintER project assets and intellectual property. The separation of Tiziana’s existing life sciences research and development related to the StemPrintER project into the Company will enable us and Tiziana to separately direct our respective business strategies to maximize value for our respective shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition, the separation of the StemPrintER project into a separate company is intended to enhance the visibility and transparency of our and Tiziana’s respective businesses, provide choice and liquidity for all investors to choose to invest, or not, in the bioscience and diagnostics businesses, and provide clear accountability, together with targeted incentive arrangements, for management and employees. The demerger will allow the Company to focus these commercialization efforts as a separate company with reserves of $1,353,373 (£1,000,000) which was collected in January 2022.
 
Tiziana has and will continue to provide certain limited management and administrative services to the Company following the completion of the demerger. Tiziana and the Company have entered into a demerger agreement which sets out certain agreements that govern certain aspects of the relationship between Tiziana and the Company and their respective subsidiaries following the demerger, details of the demerger Agreement are more fully outlined in “Item 7 —Management Discussion & Analysis”.
 
Our principal capital expenditures are devoted to conducting research and development of our novel product candidate, StemPrintER, establishing US corporate headquarters with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments “CLIA”-certified laboratory and further validating the StemPrint platform in other tumor types as further discussed in “Item 7—Management Discussion & Analysis”.
 
On December 1, 2021 Accustem Sciences Inc., a Delaware corporation (“New Accustem”), has become the successor issuer to Accustem Sciences Limited, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales (“Old Accustem”), pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such succession occurred following the effectiveness, on December 1, 2021 (the “Effective Time”), of a United Kingdom court-approved scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme of Arrangement”) in which (i) every 20 ordinary shares, £0.01 par value per share, of Old Accustem (the “Old Accustem Ordinary Shares”) were exchanged for one share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of New Accustem (the “New Accustem Common Stock”) and (ii) every 10 ADS representing two Old Accustem Ordinary Shares were exchanged for one New Accustem Common Stock, which resulted in New Accustem becoming the holding company of Old Accustem. On December 30, 2021, the Company completed dissolution of Old Accustem.

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the U.S. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. This includes an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may take advantage of this exemption for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in total annual gross revenue, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these provisions that allow for reduced reporting and other requirements.
 
StemPrintER and Market Opportunity in Breast Cancer
 
Each year, more than two million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide. Endocrine receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers constitute the majority of breast cancer cases (~75%) and display remarkable variability in clinical behavior. This heterogeneity makes prognosis and therapy response often challenging to predict using the standard clinicopathological features of the tumor. Although the overall prognosis for this group of patients is good, a significant proportion (>20%) of these patients will experience distant recurrence in the first 10 years post-surgery. For ER+ patients who also have a negative HER2 status (HER2-), the standard of care is endocrine therapy with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy in those patients considered to be at risk of recurrence according to clinicopathological parameters. However, it has become apparent that these parameters are often insufficient to predict risk of recurrence in ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients, and, as a consequence, a significant proportion of these patients are either over- or under-treated. We anticipate StemPrintER will be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation to identify a patient’s risk of recurrence to help physicians optimize treatment planning throughout the care continuum.
 
StemPrintER has a novel biological basis in the stem cell biology and interrogates the intrinsic content and aggressiveness of cancer stem cells of the primary tumor. The assay uses a reliable real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) platform for testing. StemPrintER was developed and clinically validated in a retrospective analysis using a consecutive series of approximately 2,400 patients with breast cancer from the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). Subsequently, StemPrintER was independently validated using a cohort of approximately 800 ER+/HER2- postmenopausal patients from the prospective, randomized TransATAC trial.
 
StemPrintER Scientific Background
 
The development and validation of multi-gene assays that interrogate the underlying biology of tumors for accurate prognostication of individual cancer patients has represented an expanding area of research for more than a decade. The increasingly recognized relevance of cancer stem cells to tumor heterogeneity and disease course suggests that the knowledge of the “degree of stemness” of a breast cancer might substantially advance individualized patient management. StemPrintER was developed to be a novel genomic predictor of patient outcomes based on a cluster of 20 stem cell genes whose expression levels would be capable of stratifying patients into two distinct groups: those at very low risk of cancer recurrence and those at an increased risk of their cancer returning. This information is intended to inform treatment planning at various timepoints throughout the patient care continuum.

Our initial research focused on genes that could discriminate mammary stem cells from progeny cells in normal breast tissue. Only those genes that were expressed at higher levels in mammary stem cells versus progeny were selected. Selection criteria were based on the premise that cancer stem cells might display traits reminiscent of those present in normal mammary stem cells and, since cancer stem cells are rare, the selection of overexpressed genes (mammary stem cells versus progeny) afforded a higher likelihood of scoring differences, with respect to under-expressed genes.
 
Based on existing published research, several of the 20 stem cell genes display evident connection to metastatic dissemination through their role in matrix degradation, migration, invasion and engraftment (e.g., MMP1, SNF, MIEN1, PHLDA2, EPB41L5). For other genes in the signature (RACGAP1, H2AFZ, H2AFJ, APOBEC3B, CENPW, TOP2A CDK1) it was considered possible, or even probable, that they were significant in the establishment of cancer stem cell phenotypes and might be linked to involvement in genomic instability. A final set of genes, whose putative role in metastasis is less obvious, includes those involved in: (a) metabolism reprogramming and mitochondrial physiology (MRPS23, NDUFB10, Phb); (b) mRNA ribonucleoparticle biogenesis, mRNA transcription, splicing and export, and RNA processing and degradation events (ALYREF, EXOSC4); and (c) survival/escape from apoptosis, which is connected to resistance to hormonal and/or chemotherapy through hijacking of signalling pathways, such as TGF-beta and pi3k-AKT-mTOR (NOL3, LY6E, EIF4EBP1). Additional evidence for a mechanistic link between the 20 genes and the cancer stem cell phenotype comes from the observation that these genes are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, sometimes as a consequence of gene amplification.
 
StemPrintER Clinical Research History
 
Through a validation study analyzing a large prospective, randomized cohort of breast cancer patients with high-quality follow-up, and a series of retrospective studies based on the use of fresh tumor samples and gene expression profiles from additional breast cancer patients, it has been established that StemPrintER predicts the individual likelihood of developing distant metastases in luminal (ER+/HER2-) and triple negative breast cancers. Of note, our genomic predictor comprises a set of genes that do not belong (with one exception) to any other genomic tool or molecular classifier described for triple negative or luminal breast cancers. We accordingly believe that the result of our research is the development of a unique tool capable of probing into the “degree of stemness”, and hence into the clinical outcome, of breast cancers.
 
The largest validation study for StemPrintER involved the retrospective analysis of nearly 2,400 breast tumor samples collected through the IEO clinical network. In this published study, StemPrint and StemPrintER were highly prognostic for early and late recurrences in luminal (ER+/HER2-) and triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer patients, independent of standard clinical characteristics.
 
In the TransATAC cohort of ER+/HER2- post-menopausal breast cancer patients, a team of scientists from the IEO conducted an independent validation of StemPrintER using banked study samples in collaboration with the Royal Marsden Hospital and Queen Mary University in London. The likelihood ratio x2 (LRx2) and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess prognostic information provided by StemPrintER and OncotypeDX. Comparative analyses were made for DR risk over the entire 10-year follow-up period, as well as in the early (0-5 years) or late (5-10 years) interval. Our study results showed that StemPrintER was highly prognostic for recurrence risk (insert HR and stats). Additionally, StemPrintER outperformed Oncotype DX RS in 10-year DR risk prediction in all patients, as well as in N0 and N1-3 patients.

Commercialization of the StemPrint Platform and StemPrintER
 
From a clinical standpoint, although future studies are warranted to increase the level of clinical evidence of the reliability and applicability of the 20-gene test, the recent independent validation using the TransATAC cohort demonstrates the immediate relevance of StemPrintER for the clinical management of breast cancer patients, in particular for those with ER+/HER2- disease. These luminal patients represent the majority (~75%) of newly-diagnosed cases and display high molecular heterogeneity and variability in their clinical behavior. Accordingly, ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients can greatly benefit from accurate stratification of their risk of recurrence for the development of an optimal treatment plan.
 
Historically in breast cancer, multi-gene assays have been used to inform the role of systemic therapy following surgery. While we believe that StemPrintER may have the same ability, especially in identifying patients with excellent long-term prognosis who would not derive significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, we plan to focus on answering alternative clinical questions not addressed by current commercially-available products. We will devote our resources to obtaining established cohorts of patients and running prospective clinical trials that may demonstrate a broader utility for StemPrintER.
 
Our initial plan is to launch StemPrintER testing for patients with breast cancer once we have achieved several key milestones. First, we are planning to build corporate headquarters in Phoenix, AZ that will also house a clinical laboratory. That laboratory will be responsible for processing, testing and reporting StemPrintER results for all commercial samples. Further, once the laboratory is established, we will obtain CLIA certification so that we are able to report results for clinical use and to seek reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Finally, we will transfer the StemPrintER technology from the laboratory in which it was developed (at the IEO) to our laboratory in Phoenix. Once those tasks are complete we will be able to commercially launch StemPrintER, and we plan to focus on the US market.
 
To augment the value proposition of the StemPrint platform, we also plan to offer additional “commodity” testing (e.g., IHC receptor testing, hereditary genetic testing). These additional tests should create significant value for our customers while leveraging existing laboratory equipment and processes for economy of scale and providing additional revenue opportunities to the Company.
 
Given the broad applicability of tumor “stemness”, which has been evaluated in a multitude of different cancers, we believe the StemPrint platform will have meaningful clinical utility beyond breast cancer. As such, we plan on validating and commercializing StemPrint in a variety of different tumor types. Each tumor type, where applicable, would also include ancillary testing to boost our value proposition to customers.
 
Reimbursement Strategy
 
Our revenue is expected to be derived from different sources including standard private third-party and government medical insurance coverage and reimbursement models. Prior to full commercial scaling, we expect to focus our sales efforts on a small number of early adopting sites to establish ordering history with payers, effective logistics and additional clinical utility, subject to successful validation trials and approvals under the CLIA certification or upon the obtaining of a CE mark for the test.

Competition
 
Genetic and genomic testing play an important and continually evolving role in the oncology space. In breast cancer, there are several companies that offer genomic testing that might be competitive with StemPrintER.
 
Breast Cancer Index (Hologic) is an assay that is designed to predict the likelihood of late breast cancer recurrence and determine the need for extended endocrine therapy (an additional 5 years of endocrine therapy beyond the standard five years). The test is for pre- and post-menopausal patients with ER+/HER2- disease and up to three positive lymph nodes.
 
EndoPredict (Myriad) is a CE-marked assay that is designed to predict the likelihood of metastases developing within 10 years of an initial breast cancer diagnosis. The test is for pre- and post-menopausal patients with early stage ER+/HER2- breast cancer and up to 3 positive lymph nodes.
 
MammaPrint (Agendia) is a Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-cleared, CE-marked assay that is designed to assess the risk of distant recurrence within 5 years and whether a person would benefit from chemotherapy. The test is for pre- and post-menopausal patients with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer, with a tumor size of 5 centimeters or less, and LN-negative or LN-positive disease (up to 3 positive nodes). The test can be used irrespective of ER and HER2 status.
 
OncotypeDX is a CE-marked assay that is designed to asses the risk of distant metastasis and to predict the need for chemotherapy in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. The test can be used in pre- and post-menopausal patients with up to three positive lymph nodes.
 
Prosigna (Veracyte) is a CE-marked assay designed to provide information on breast cancer subtype and to predict distant recurrence-free survival at 10 years. The test is for postmenopausal patients with early-stage ER+/HER2- breast cancer that is LN-negative or LN-positive (up to 3 positive nodes).
 
The “commodity” testing that we plan to offer (e.g., IHC receptor testing, somatic mutation testing, hereditary genetic testing) has numerous competitors in industry (e.g., Ambry, Color Health, Foundation Medicine, Guardant, Invitae, Laboratory Corporation of America, Natera, Neogenomics, Quest Diagnostics, Tempus) and academic and hospital settings.
 
Government Regulation
 
U.S. health regulatory overview
 
The following provides an overview of key aspects of laboratory service and medical device regulation within the U.S. It should be noted this overview does not address every facet of regulation at the federal and state level, but only those that would generally be most relevant to the activities described in this registration statement.

-


Federal and state clinical laboratory licensing requirements
 
The CLIA governs the operations of all clinical laboratories operating in or returning results to individuals in the U.S. CLIA is administered by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (‘CMS’), in partnership with state health departments. A clinical laboratory is defined as a laboratory that performs testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the assessment of health. Clinical laboratories must hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations they perform and must demonstrate compliance with regulations addressing, among other things, personnel qualification and training, record keeping, quality control, and proficiency testing, all of which are intended to ensure the timeliness, reliability, and accuracy of clinical laboratory testing services. CLIA requires that laboratories demonstrate or verify the analytical validity of all tests they perform. Where a clinical laboratory analyses specimens based on a proprietary test method (i.e., a laboratory developed test, ‘LDT’), the laboratory must, among other things, document the accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity of, and establish a reference range for, such test.
 
CMS provides for exemption from CLIA for states that develop clinical laboratory standards that are at least as stringent as federal requirements. Both New York and Washington State are exempt from CLIA. The NYS Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program requires all independent clinical laboratories operating in, or testing specimens from, NYS to obtain a laboratory permit prior to commencing operations, and all clinical laboratories performing LDTs to submit test validation documentation demonstrating the tests’ analytical and clinical validity.
 
Failure to comply with CLIA certification and state clinical laboratory licensure requirements may result in a range of enforcement actions, including certificate or license suspension, limitation, or revocation, directed plan of action, onsite monitoring, civil monetary penalties, criminal sanctions, and revocation of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment for its services, as well as significant adverse publicity.
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
The FDA regulates, among other medical products, “medical devices” which include certain articles intended for use in the diagnosis, prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease or intended to effect the structure or function of the body. Whether a product is intended for use as a medical device is generally determined, in the first instance, based on the manufacturer’s product labelling, which includes the label affixed to the product, materials distributed with the product, and promotional communications concerning the product.
 
Devices classified as Class I (low risk), generally may be marketed without FDA pre-market review, but are subject to “general controls”, including establishment registration, device listing, record keeping, medical device reporting, and quality system regulations, including design controls. Devices classified as Class II (moderate risk), may, in addition to general controls, also be subject to “special controls” (e.g., performance standards / manufacturing standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, special labelling requirements, pre-market data requirements and guidelines), and also generally must obtain 510(k) premarket clearance or DeNovo authorization from FDA. Class III (high risk) devices must, in addition to general controls, obtain FDA pre-market approval through the submission of a pre- market approval application that contains evidence, including data from adequate and well- controlled clinical studies, demonstrating that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In general, devices that require FDA pre-market clearance or DeNovo authorization may not be commercially distributed or promoted prior to obtaining such authorization, although they may be distributed and used for the purpose of developing the clinical data necessary to support FDA marketing applications, subject to certain limitations. Post-market changes to a cleared / authorized or approved device also may be subject to prior review by FDA, depending on the scope of the change and its potential impact on device safety and effectiveness.
 

7
-


It should also be emphasized that this pre-market review process is only one facet of FDA’s regulation. For example, FDA regulates product labelling, including promotional claims; the manufacturing of medical devices, including their design, under FDA quality system requirements; clinical trials with new or modified products; and post-market monitoring for, reporting of, and action related to, safety concerns. Failure to comply with applicable pre and post-market device requirements can result in a determination by FDA that a device is “adulterated” (Section 501) or “misbranded” (Section 502) in violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. The statute provides for a number of penalties, including seizure, injunction, criminal, and civil monetary penalties, for the sale or distribution of adulterated or misbranded devices. In general, prior to undertaking enforcement action, FDA will notify a regulated entity of a violation or suspected 36 violation through a communication, such as a “Warning Letter” or “Untitled Letter”. If FDA identifies violations during inspection of a manufacturer’s facility, the agency will issue a Form 483 listing the identified violation and directing the manufacturer to make the necessary corrections.
 
FDA regulation of software
 
Commercially distributed software applications that meet the definition of a medical device may be subject to FDA pre-market authorization, depending on their classification and software function. These include both applications that are components of a hardware medical device and certain “standalone” software. In 2017, FDA issued final guidance adopting international principles established by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum for the clinical evaluation of software as a medical device (“SaMD”), which refers to software that is intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device. In 2019, FDA issued a guidance that provides guidance on FDA’s oversight of device software functions including mobile medical apps that meet the definition of a device. While the guidance is not binding on either FDA or regulated industry, FDA intends to consider the principles in developing regulatory approaches for SaMD as well as for digital health technologies.
 
FDA regulation of LDTs
 
FDA regulates a category of medical devices, called in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or IVDs, that are used in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens from the human body. IVDs include reagents, instruments, and systems that are intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevention disease or its sequelae. FDA historically has taken the position that tests developed in-house by a clinical laboratory and used to analyze patient specimens meet the definition of an IVD and fall within the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction. At the same time, FDA historically has for the most part exercised “enforcement discretion,” i.e., has not required clinical laboratories performing LDTs to comply with IVD device requirements. In the past, FDA has signaled intent to modify its enforcement discretion policy with regard to LDT regulation, and in 2014 proposed a regulatory framework for LDTs, which it abandoned before implementation in 2016. As of August 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that LDTs will not require a premarket review with FDA, but rather an applicant may voluntarily submit a premarket notification or premarket approval (or an Emergency Use Authorization in the case of COVID-19 tests) for their LDT. It is possible that Congress will enact legislation directing FDA to regulate LDTs.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Protection Laws
 
Within the U.S., the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), has authority to regulate advertising for most medical devices and for laboratory services. In addition, various state consumer protection laws exist which can similarly regulate claims that are being made by entities with respect to what benefits their products or services can provide to consumers. In some instances, FTC or U.S. states have taken action with respect to medical products based on claims being made with respect to, e.g., their benefits to patients, seeking various penalties, such as injunctions and substantial fines. Activities have focused more, to date, on products that are sold directly to consumers, such as dietary supplements, as opposed to prescription products ordered by physicians, although the possibility exists that FTC or other consumer protection bodies could take steps to regulate claims with respect to IVDs or LDTs.
Fraud and Abuse
 
The significant U.S. fraud and abuse laws include the:
 

● | Anti-Kickback Statute: the federal U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S. Code § 1320a–7b(b) imposes criminal penalties on persons and entities for, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a government healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid.

● | False Claims Act: the U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil U.S. False Claims Act (31 USC. §§ 3729 – 3733), impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things knowingly presenting or False Claims Act: the U.S. federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil U.S. False Claims Act (31 USC. §§ 3729 – 3733), impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages, significant per-claim penalties, and administrative penalties. 

 
Transparency requirements
 
The U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act (known as Affordable Care Act Section 6002: Transparency Reports and Reporting of Physician Ownership or Investment Interests) requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the CMS information related to payments or transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Any failure to report or providing incomplete or misleading information may subject the Company to penalties. Analogous state laws. Analogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as U.S. state antikickback and false claims laws, can apply to sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by governmental or non-governmental third-party payors. These laws are generally broad and are enforced by many different U.S. federal and state agencies as well as through private actions. Some state laws require adherence to compliance guidelines promulgated by the U.S. federal government and require device and drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.

Data privacy and security
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)
 
The HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, failing to protect the privacy of patient and security of patient data. Additionally, the HIPAA by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations on covered entities and their business associates that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf, including mandatory contractual terms as well as implementing reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information.
Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”)
 
The FTC has taken an active role with regard to protection of personal information, relying on its broad consumer protection powers to seek substantial penalties where companies that have made deceptive or misleading statements regarding practices of collecting and safeguarding data or did not have adequate safeguards to protect information consistent with their claims regarding data security. State laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Our code of ethics, other corporate policies and procedures, and the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are available through our website at www.accustem.com.
