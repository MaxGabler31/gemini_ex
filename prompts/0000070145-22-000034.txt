Item 1 | Business

The Company and its Subsidiaries
National Fuel Gas Company (the Registrant), incorporated in 1902, is a holding company organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey. The Registrant owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding securities of its subsidiaries. Reference to “the Company” in this report means the Registrant, the Registrant and its subsidiaries or the Registrant’s subsidiaries as appropriate in the context of the disclosure. Also, all references to a certain year in this report relate to the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30 of that year unless otherwise noted.
The Company is a diversified energy company engaged principally in the production, gathering, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas. The Company operates an integrated business, with assets centered in western New York and Pennsylvania, being used for, and benefiting from, the production and transportation of natural gas from the Appalachian basin. Current natural gas production development activities are focused in the Marcellus and Utica shales, geological shale formations that are present nearly a mile or more below the surface in the Appalachian region of the United States. Pipeline development activities are designed to transport natural gas production to both existing and new markets. The common geographic footprint of the Company’s subsidiaries enables them to share management, labor, facilities and support services across various businesses and pursue coordinated projects designed to produce and transport natural gas from the Appalachian basin to markets in the eastern United States and Canada. The Company reports financial results for four business segments: Exploration and Production, Pipeline and Storage, Gathering, and Utility.
1. The Exploration and Production segment operations are carried out by Seneca Resources Company, LLC (Seneca), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Seneca is engaged in the exploration for, and the development and production of, primarily natural gas in the Appalachian region of the United States. At September 30, 2022, Seneca had proved developed and undeveloped reserves of 4,170,662 MMcf of natural gas and 250 Mbbl of oil.
2.  The Pipeline and Storage segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (Supply Corporation), a Pennsylvania corporation, and Empire Pipeline, Inc. (Empire), a New York corporation. Supply Corporation and Empire provide interstate natural gas transportation services for affiliated and nonaffiliated companies through integrated gas pipeline systems in Pennsylvania and New York. Supply Corporation also provides storage services through its underground natural gas storage fields, and Empire provides storage service (via lease with Supply Corporation) to a nonaffiliated company.
3. The Gathering segment operations are carried out by wholly-owned subsidiaries of National Fuel Gas Midstream Company, LLC (Midstream Company), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Through these subsidiaries, Midstream Company builds, owns and operates natural gas processing and pipeline gathering facilities in the Appalachian region.
4. The Utility segment operations are carried out by National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution Corporation), a New York corporation. Distribution Corporation provides natural gas utility services to approximately 754,000 customers through a local distribution system located in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The principal metropolitan areas served by Distribution Corporation include Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Jamestown, New York and Erie and Sharon, Pennsylvania.
Financial information about each of the Company’s business segments can be found in Item 7, MD&A and also in Item 8 at Note M — Business Segment Information.
Seneca’s Northeast Division is included in the Company's All Other category for 2021 and 2020. This division marketed timber from Appalachian land holdings. On August 5, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all timber and other assets, which at September 30, 2020, accounted for the Company's ownership of approximately 95,000 acres of timber property and management of approximately 2,500 additional acres of timber cutting rights. The transaction closed on December 10, 2020.

For additional discussion of the purchase and sale agreement to sell these assets, see Item 8 at Note B — Asset Acquisitions and Divestitures. 
Revenues from three customers of the Company's Exploration and Production segment, exclusive of hedging losses transacted with separate parties, represented approximately $850 million, or 38.9%, of the Company's consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022. These three customers were also customers of the Company's Pipeline and Storage segment, accounting for an additional $15 million, or 0.7%, of the Company's consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022.
Rates and Regulation
The Company’s businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies. This includes federal and state agency regulations with respect to rate proceedings, project permitting and environmental requirements. 
The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC with respect to Supply Corporation, Empire and some transactions performed by other Company subsidiaries. The FERC, among other things, approves the rates that Supply Corporation and Empire may charge to their gas transportation and/or storage customers. Those approved rates also impact the returns that Supply Corporation and Empire may earn on the assets that are dedicated to those operations. The operations of Distribution Corporation are subject to the jurisdiction of the NYPSC, the PaPUC and, with respect to certain transactions, the FERC. The NYPSC and the PaPUC, among other things, approve the rates that Distribution Corporation may charge to its utility customers. Those approved rates also impact the returns that Distribution Corporation may earn on the assets that are dedicated to those operations. If Supply Corporation, Empire or Distribution Corporation are unable to obtain approval from these regulators for the rates they are requesting to charge customers, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, earnings may decrease. For additional discussion of the Pipeline and Storage and Utility segments’ rates, see Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Rate Matters” and Item 8 at Note A — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Regulatory Mechanisms) and Note F — Regulatory Matters. 
The discussion under Item 8 at Note F — Regulatory Matters includes a description of the regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with applicable accounting standards. To the extent that the criteria set forth in such accounting standards are not met by the operations of the Utility segment or the Pipeline and Storage segment, as the case may be, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and such accounting treatment would be discontinued.
The FERC also exercises jurisdiction over the construction and operation of interstate gas transmission and storage facilities and possesses significant penalty authority with respect to violations of the laws and regulations it administers. The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA issues regulations and conducts evaluations, among other things, that set safety standards for pipelines and underground storage facilities. PHMSA may delegate this authority to a state, as it has in New York and Pennsylvania, and that state may choose to institute more stringent safety regulations for the construction, operation and maintenance of intrastate facilities. In addition to this state safety authority program, the NYPSC imposes additional requirements on the construction of certain utility facilities. Increased regulation by these agencies, and other regulators, or requested changes to construction projects, could lead to operational delays or restrictions and increase compliance costs that the Company may not be able to recover fully through rates or otherwise offset. 
For additional discussion of the material effects of compliance with government environmental regulation, see Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters.”

The Gathering segment generated approximately 94% of its revenues in 2022 from services provided to the Exploration and Production segment.
Additional discussion of the Gathering segment appears below under the headings “Sources and Availability of Raw Materials” and “Competition: The Gathering Segment,” in Item 7, MD&A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The Utility Segment
The Utility segment contributed net income of $68.9 million in 2022. 
Additional discussion of the Utility segment appears below under the headings “Sources and Availability of Raw Materials,” “Competition: The Utility Segment” and “Seasonality,” in Item 7, MD&A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
All Other Category and Corporate Operations
The All Other category and Corporate operations incurred a net loss of $12.7 million in 2022. 
Additional discussion of the All Other category and Corporate operations appears below in Item 7, MD&A and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Exploration and Production segment seeks to discover and produce raw materials (natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids) as further described in this report in Item 7, MD&A and Item 8 at Note M — Business Segment Information and Note N — Supplementary Information for Oil and Gas Producing Activities.
The Pipeline and Storage segment transports and stores natural gas owned by its customers, whose gas primarily originates in the Appalachian region of the United States, as well as other gas supply regions in the United States and Canada. Additional discussion of proposed pipeline projects appears below under “Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment” and in Item 7, MD&A.
The Gathering segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas that is, in large part, produced by Seneca in the Appalachian region of the United States.
Natural gas is the principal raw material for the Utility segment. In 2022, the Utility segment purchased 76.0 Bcf of gas (including 74.2 Bcf for delivery to retail customers and 1.8 Bcf used in operations) pursuant to its purchase contracts with firm delivery requirements. Gas purchased from producers and suppliers in the United States under multi-month contracts accounted for 48% of these purchases. Purchases of gas in the spot market (contracts of one month or less) accounted for 52% of the Utility segment’s 2022 purchases. Purchases from DTE Energy Trading, Inc. (33%), Emera Energy Services, Inc. (12%), Chevron Natural Gas (8%), EQT Energy, LLC (7%), Vitol Inc. (6%), Tenaska Marketing Ventures (6%), and Shell Energy North America US (6%), accounted for nearly 78% of the Utility segment's 2022 gas purchases. No other producer or supplier provided the Utility segment with more than 5% of its gas requirements in 2022. The Utility segment does not directly purchase gas from affiliates.

Competition
Competition in the natural gas industry exists among providers of natural gas, as well as between natural gas and other sources of energy, such as fuel oil and electricity. Management believes that the reliability and affordability, along with the environmental advantages of natural gas have enhanced its competitive position relative to other fuels.
The Company competes on the basis of price, service and reliability, product performance and other factors. Sources and providers of energy, other than those described under this “Competition” heading, do not compete with the Company to any significant extent.
Competition: The Exploration and Production Segment
The Exploration and Production segment competes with other natural gas producers and marketers with respect to sales of natural gas. The Exploration and Production segment also competes, by competitive bidding and otherwise, with other natural gas producers with respect to exploration and development prospects and mineral leaseholds.
To compete in this environment, Seneca originates and acts primarily as operator on its prospects, seeks to minimize the risk of exploratory efforts through partnership-type arrangements, utilizes technology for both exploratory studies and drilling operations, and seeks prospect and partnership opportunities based on size, operating expertise and financial criteria.
Competition: The Pipeline and Storage Segment
Supply Corporation competes for market growth in the natural gas market with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and with other companies providing gas storage services. Supply Corporation has some unique characteristics which enhance its competitive position. Most of Supply Corporation’s facilities are in or near areas overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale production areas in Pennsylvania, and it has established interconnections with producers and other pipelines that provide access to these supplies and to premium off-system markets. Its facilities are also located adjacent to the Canadian border at the Niagara River providing access to markets in Canada and the northeastern and midwestern United States via the TC Energy pipeline system. Supply Corporation has developed and placed into service a number of pipeline expansion projects designed to transport natural gas to key markets in New York, Pennsylvania, the northeastern United States, Canada, and to long-haul pipelines with access to the U.S. Midwest and the Gulf Coast. For further discussion of Pipeline and Storage projects, refer to Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Investing Cash Flow.” 
Empire competes for natural gas market growth with other pipeline companies transporting gas in the northeast United States and upstate New York in particular. Empire is well situated to provide transportation of Appalachian shale gas as well as gas supplies available at Empire’s interconnect with TC Energy at Chippawa. Empire’s geographic location provides it the opportunity to compete for service to its on-system LDC markets, as well as for a share of the gas transportation markets into Canada (via Chippawa) and into the northeastern United States. The Empire Connector, along with other subsequent projects, has expanded Empire’s footprint and capability, allowing Empire to serve new markets in New York and elsewhere in the Northeast, and to attach to prolific Marcellus and Utica supplies principally from Tioga and Bradford Counties in Pennsylvania. Like Supply Corporation, Empire’s expanded system facilitates transportation of natural gas to key markets within New York State, the northeastern United States and Canada.
Competition: The Gathering Segment
The Gathering segment provides gathering services for Seneca and, to a lesser extent, other producers. It competes with other companies that gather and process natural gas in the Appalachian region.
Competition: The Utility Segment
With respect to gas commodity service, in New York and Pennsylvania, both of which have implemented “unbundling” policies that allow customers to choose their gas commodity supplier, Distribution Corporation 
-9-


has retained a substantial majority of small sales customers. In both New York and Pennsylvania, approximately 8% of Distribution Corporation’s small-volume residential and commercial customers purchase their supplies from unregulated marketers. In contrast, almost all large-volume load is served by unregulated retail marketers. However, retail competition for gas commodity service does not pose an acute competitive threat for Distribution Corporation, because in both jurisdictions, utility cost of service is recovered through rates and charges for gas delivery service, not gas commodity service. 
Competition for transportation service to large-volume customers continues with local producers or pipeline companies attempting to sell or transport gas directly to end-users located within the Utility segment’s service territories without use of the utility’s facilities (i.e., bypass). In addition, while competition with fuel oil suppliers exists, natural gas retains its competitive position despite recent commodity pricing.
The Utility segment competes in its most vulnerable markets (the large commercial and industrial markets) by offering unbundled, flexible, high quality services. The Utility segment continues to advance programs promoting the efficient use of natural gas.
Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation in jurisdictions that impact the Utility segment. In addition to the Inflation Reduction Act, New York, for example, adopted the Climate Leadership & Community Protection Act (CLCPA) in July 2019, which could ultimately result in increased competition from electric and geothermal forms of energy. However, given the extended time frames associated with the CLCPA's emission reduction mandates as discussed in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters” and subheading “Environmental Regulation,” any meaningful competition resulting from the CLCPA cannot be determined.
Seasonality
Variations in weather conditions can materially affect the volume of natural gas delivered by the Utility segment, as virtually all of its residential and commercial customers use natural gas for space heating. The effect that this has on Utility segment margins in New York is largely mitigated by a weather normalization clause (WNC), which covers the eight-month period from October through May. Weather that is warmer than normal results in an upward adjustment to customers’ current bills, while weather that is colder than normal results in a downward adjustment, so that in either case projected delivery revenues calculated at normal temperatures will be largely recovered.
Volumes transported and stored by Supply Corporation and by Empire may vary significantly depending on weather, without materially affecting the revenues of those companies. Supply Corporation’s and Empire’s allowed rates are based on a straight fixed-variable rate design which allows recovery of fixed costs in fixed monthly reservation charges. Variable charges based on volumes are designed to recover only the variable costs associated with actual transportation or storage of gas.
Capital Expenditures
A discussion of capital expenditures by business segment is included in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Investing Cash Flow.”
Environmental Matters
A discussion of material environmental matters involving the Company is included in Item 7, MD&A under the heading “Environmental Matters” and in Item 8, Note L — Commitments and Contingencies.
Miscellaneous
The Utility segment has numerous municipal franchises under which it uses public roads and certain other rights-of-way and public property for the location of facilities. When necessary, the Utility segment renews such franchises.
The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on the Company’s website, www.nationalfuelgas.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished 
-10-


to the SEC. The information available at the Company’s website is not part of this Form 10-K or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC.
Human Capital
The Company aims to attract the best employees, to retain those employees through offering competitive benefits, career development and training opportunities, while also prioritizing their safety and wellness, and to create a safe, inclusive and productive work environment for everyone. Human capital measures and objectives that the Company focuses on in managing its business include the safety of its employees, its voluntary attrition rate, the number of work stoppages, its employee benefits, employee development, and diversity and inclusion. Additional information regarding the Company’s human capital measures and objectives is contained in the Company’s recently published Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on the Company’s website, www.nationalfuelgas.com. The information on the Company’s website is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any of the Company’s other filings with the SEC.
Employees and Collective Bargaining Agreements
The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries had a total of 2,132 full-time employees at September 30, 2022.
As of September 30, 2022, 48% of the Company’s active workforce was covered under collective bargaining agreements. The Company has agreements in place with collective bargaining units in New York into February 2025, as well as with collective bargaining units in Pennsylvania into April 2026.
Safety
Safety is one of the Company’s guiding principles. In managing the business, the Company focuses on the safety of its employees and contractors and has implemented safety programs and management practices to promote a culture of safety. This includes required trainings for both field and office employees, as well as specific qualifications and certifications for field employees. The Company also ties executive compensation to safety related goals to emphasize the importance of and focus on safety at the Company.
Voluntary Attrition Rate
The Company measures the voluntary attrition rate of its employees in assessing the Company’s overall human capital. The Company's voluntary attrition rate (not including retirements and excluding the severance related to the sale of Seneca's assets in California) was 8%. Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company did not institute any furloughs or workforce reductions. 
No Work Stoppages
During the Company’s fiscal year, the Company did not incur any work stoppages (strikes or lockouts) and therefore experienced zero idle days for the fiscal year.
Employee Benefits
To attract employees and meet the needs of the Company’s workforce, the Company offers market-competitive benefits packages to employees of its subsidiaries. The Company’s benefits package options may vary depending on type of employee and date of hire. Additionally, the Company continuously looks for ways to improve employee work-life balance and well-being.
Employee Development
The Company provides its employees with tools and development resources to enhance their skills and careers at the Company, including: (i) encouraging employees to discuss their professional development and identify interests or possible cross-training areas during annual performance reviews with their supervisors; (ii) offering corporate and technical training programs based on position, regulatory environment, and employee needs; (iii) providing a tuition aid program for educational pursuits related to present work or possible future positions; (iv) providing talent review and succession planning; (v) providing opportunities for on-the-job growth, through stretch assignments or temporary projects outside of an employee’s typical responsibilities; and 
-11-


(vi) offering one-on-one meetings for supervisory employees at the Company’s subsidiaries to discuss career pathing and employee development.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
The Company recognizes that a diverse talent pool provides the opportunity to gain a diversity of perspectives, ideas and solutions to help the Company succeed. As such, the Company approaches diversity from the top-down, which is reflected in the makeup of our Board of Directors and senior leadership team: three out of eleven directors are diverse, and four of the Company’s eight designated executive officers are women. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines incorporate the “Rooney Rule.” As a result, when identifying independent director candidates for nomination to the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is committed to including in any initial candidate pool qualified racially, ethnically and/or gender diverse candidates. Beginning in fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee adopted specific diversity and inclusion performance goals as part of the Company's Annual at Risk Compensation Incentive Plan and Executive Annual Compensation Incentive Program to link executive compensation to the Company's focus on diversity. 
During fiscal 2022, the Company furthered numerous initiatives to increase the diversity of our workforce and create a more inclusive environment. The Company's Director of Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I Director”) continued to spearhead diversity and inclusion initiatives across the organization. Additional resources were added to the Diversity and Inclusion team with the creation of a Diversity and Inclusion Specialist ("D&I Specialist") role to assist and expand the Company’s proactive efforts of creating a more inclusive organization. These efforts include initiatives to focus on diversity when making hiring and promotional decisions. To attract diverse candidates, the Company works with community groups and organizations to help promote awareness of our job opportunities within diverse communities. The D&I Director maintains close partnerships with the employment teams, cultivates the Company’s relationships with community organizations, and focuses on initiatives to attract diverse candidates, vendors and suppliers. The executive team receives a monthly report about the composition of the Company’s salaried applicant pools to encourage the recruiting team to focus recruiting in diverse communities and identify resources needed to do so. The Company has also focused on encouraging diverse suppliers to receive the necessary certifications to participate in the industry and has added new diverse suppliers to its list of vendors in an effort to promote diversity.
The D&I Director and D&I Specialist also spearhead inclusion initiatives throughout the organization. To promote a more inclusive work environment, the Company has continued to provide training opportunities to employees relating to Unconscious Bias, Inclusivity, and Micro-aggressions. In addition, four new Employee Resource Groups, focused towards ethnically diverse, veteran, LGBTQ and female employees, were developed. These Employee Resource Groups provide an opportunity to engage and connect with underrepresented employees, and each group has an executive sponsor which helps facilitate communication directly to senior management. In addition, the Company has several policies that reinforce its commitment to diversity and inclusion within the workplace. The Company’s Employee Handbook Policy includes equal employment opportunity commitments and nondiscrimination and anti-harassment disclosures, which communicate the Company’s expectations with respect to maintaining a professional workplace free of harassment. The Company prohibits discrimination or harassment against any employee or applicant on the basis of sex, race/ethnicity, or the other protected categories listed within the Company’s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy. This policy is mailed to employees annually with an employee survey, and employees must acknowledge that they have received the policy. The Company reiterates its commitment to a harassment free workplace through this process, as well as through prevention training for employees. Annually, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer reinforces the Company’s commitment to harassment prevention and equal employment opportunity by signing corporate Equal Employment Opportunity and Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policy statements. These statements are then displayed at Company locations, included in employee handbooks, and discussed with new hires during their onboarding process.
