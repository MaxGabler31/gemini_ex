Reportable Segments
We operate on a worldwide basis within our Americas and EMEA reportable segments plus an Other category. Additional information about our reportable segments, including financial information about geographic areas, is contained in Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
Americas Segment
Our Americas segment serves customers in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. Our portfolio of integrated architecture, furniture and technology products is marketed to corporate, government, healthcare, education and retail customers through the Steelcase, Coalesse, Turnstone and AMQ brands.
We serve Americas customers mainly through approximately 400 Steelcase independent and company-owned dealer locations, and we also sell directly to end-use customers. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies and are distributed across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including healthcare, manufacturing, higher education, financial services, insurance, information technology and government. No industry or vertical market individually represented more than 12% of the Americas segment's revenue in 2018.
Each of our dealers maintains its own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with our dealers throughout the selling process. The largest independent Steelcase dealer in the Americas accounted for approximately 5% of the segment’s revenue in 2018, and the five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 17% of the segment’s revenue in 2018.
In 2018, the Americas segment recorded revenue of $2,193.8, or 71.8% of our consolidated revenue, and as of the end of the year had approximately 7,800 employees, of which approximately 5,100 related to manufacturing.
The Americas office furniture industry is highly competitive, with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products. The industry competes on a combination of insight, product performance, design, price and relationships with customers, architects and designers. Our most significant competitors in the U.S. are Haworth, Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., HNI Corporation and Knoll, Inc. Together with Steelcase, domestic revenue from these companies represents approximately one-half of the U.S. office furniture industry.
EMEA Segment
Our EMEA segment serves customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily under the Steelcase and Coalesse brands, with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems, storage and seating solutions. Our largest presence is in Western Europe, where we believe we are among the market leaders in Germany, France and Spain. In 2018, approximately 85% of EMEA revenue was from Western Europe. The remaining revenue was from other parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. No individual country in the EMEA segment represented more than 5% of our consolidated revenue in 2018.
We serve EMEA customers through approximately 350 independent and company-owned Steelcase dealer locations. No single independent Steelcase dealer in the EMEA segment accounted for more than 3% of the segment’s revenue in 2018. The five largest Steelcase independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately 9% of the segment’s revenue in 2018. In certain geographic markets, we sell directly to end-use customers. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational, regional or local companies spread across a broad range of industries and vertical markets, including financial services, higher education, healthcare, government and information technology.
In 2018, our EMEA segment recorded revenue of $524.2, or 17.2% of our consolidated revenue, and as of the end of the year had approximately 2,100 employees, of which approximately 1,000 related to manufacturing.
The EMEA office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets. In several cases, these competitors focus on specific product categories.

Other Category
The Other category includes Asia Pacific, Designtex and PolyVision.
Asia Pacific serves customers in India, the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong), Australia, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia primarily under the Steelcase brand with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems, seating and storage solutions. We primarily sell directly to end-use customers as well as through approximately 50 Steelcase independent dealer locations. Our end-use customers tend to be larger multinational or regional companies spread across a broad range of industries and are located in both mature and emerging markets. Our competition in Asia Pacific is fragmented and includes large global competitors as well as many regional and local manufacturers.
Designtex primarily sells textiles, wall coverings and surface imaging solutions specified by architects and designers directly to end-use customers through a direct sales force primarily in North America.
PolyVision manufactures ceramic steel surfaces for use in various applications globally, including static whiteboards and chalkboards sold through third party fabricators and distributors to the primary and secondary education markets and architectural panels and other special applications sold through general contractors for commercial and infrastructure projects.
In 2018, the Other category accounted for $337.5, or 11.0% of our consolidated revenue, and as of the end of the year had approximately 1,800 employees, of which approximately 900 related to manufacturing.
Corporate
Corporate costs include unallocated portions of shared service functions such as information technology, corporate facilities, finance, human resources, legal, research and customer aviation, plus deferred compensation expense and income or losses associated with company-owned life insurance ("COLI").
Marketing Partnerships
We have entered into marketing partnerships with a number of other companies, including Microsoft, Blu Dot, Michell Gold + Bob Williams, FLOS, Viccarbe, Sagegreenlife and Bolia, which are intended to allow us to offer additional products and services to our dealers and customers which are complementary to our products and services. These partnerships take several forms, including situations where (1) we and our partner agree to co-market our products and services to customers, (2) we agree to market the partner’s products to our dealers and customers or (3) we purchase and resell the partner’s products to our dealers and customers.  In situations where we have agreed to market our partners’ products, we typically receive a fee from the partner on sales by the partner to our dealers and customers, and in some situations we transport and deliver those products to our dealers and customers for a fee.  Most of these relationships are on a regional basis.  
Joint Ventures and Other Equity Investments
We enter into joint ventures and other equity investments from time to time to expand or maintain our geographic presence, support our distribution network or invest in new business ventures, complementary products or services. As of February 23, 2018, our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures and other equity investments totaled $48.4. Our share of the earnings from joint ventures and other equity investments is recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Customer and Dealer Concentrations
Our largest customer accounted for approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue in 2018, and our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue. However, these percentages do not include revenue from various U.S. federal government agencies. In 2018, our sales to U.S. federal government agencies represented approximately 3% of our consolidated revenue. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end-use customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
No single independent Steelcase dealer accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. The five largest independent Steelcase dealers collectively accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated

revenue in 2018. We do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business.
Working Capital
Our accounts receivable are from our dealers and direct-sale customers. Payment terms vary by country and region. The terms of our Americas segment, and certain markets within the EMEA segment, encourage prompt payment from dealers by offering an early settlement discount. Other international markets have, by market convention, longer payment terms. We are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items, including accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable, which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large.
Backlog
Our products are generally manufactured and shipped within two to six weeks following receipt of an order; however, in recent years our mix of project business has increased and customer-requested shipment dates have increasingly extended beyond historical averages. Nevertheless, we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer-term shipments.
Global Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Manufacturing and Logistics
We have manufacturing operations throughout North America (in the U.S. and Mexico), Europe (in France, Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic and Belgium) and Asia (in China, Malaysia and India). Our global manufacturing operations are centralized under a single organization to serve our customers’ needs across multiple brands and geographies.
Our manufacturing model is predominately make-to-order with lead times typically ranging from two to six weeks.  We manufacture our products using lean manufacturing principles, including continuous one-piece flow and platforming processes and products, which allow us to achieve efficiencies and cost savings and minimize the amount of inventory on hand. As a result, we largely purchase direct materials and components from a global network of integrated suppliers as needed to meet demand. We also purchase finished goods manufactured by third parties predominantly on a make-to-order basis.
We focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, and we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort. We focus on platforming our product offering and capturing raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe. These efforts enhance our leverage with supply sources, and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements with our partners throughout our global supply chain.
Our physical distribution system utilizes commercial transport, dedicated fleet and company-owned delivery services. We utilize a network of regional distribution centers in the Americas and EMEA to reduce freight costs and improve service to our dealers and customers.
Raw Materials
Our material costs represented approximately 60% of our cost of sales in 2018 and included raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world. Those raw materials include steel, petroleum-based products, aluminum, other metals, wood, particleboard and other materials and components. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining these raw materials.
The prices for certain commodities such as steel, petroleum-based products, aluminum, other metals, wood and particleboard have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand, and the costs of these commodities can be impacted by changes in import tariffs and trade barriers. Our global supply chain team continually evaluates current market conditions, the financial viability of our suppliers and available supply options on the basis of quality, reliability of supply and cost.

Research, Design and Development
Our extensive global research—a combination of user observations, feedback sessions and sophisticated analyses—has helped us develop social, spatial and informational insights into work effectiveness. We maintain collaborative relationships with external world-class innovators, including leading universities, think tanks and knowledge leaders, to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work.
Understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe. Our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs. These solutions vary from furniture, architecture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and across different vertical market applications such as healthcare and higher education. Organizationally, global design leadership directs strategy and project work, which is distributed to design studios around the world and sometimes involves external design services.
Our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria, including financial return metrics, and chooses which products will be developed and launched. Designers then work closely with engineers and suppliers to co-develop products and processes that incorporate innovative user features with efficient manufacturing practices. Products are tested for performance, quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations.
We invested $44.0, $35.8 and $33.0 in research, design and development activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, we sometimes pay royalties to external designers of our products as the products are sold, and these costs are not included in research and development expenses.
Intellectual Property
We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. We also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace. We do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such, except the “Steelcase,” “Coalesse,” “Designtex,” “PolyVision” and “Turnstone” trademarks.
We occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products, designs or process technology. We have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries.
Employees
As of February 23, 2018, we had approximately 11,700 employees, of which approximately 7,000 work in manufacturing. Additionally, we had approximately 1,600 temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing. Approximately 100 employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 2,900 employees are represented by unions or workers' councils that operate to promote the interests of workers. Management promotes positive relations with employees based on empowerment and teamwork.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment (“Environmental Laws”). We believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all Environmental Laws. We do not believe existing Environmental Laws have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Under certain Environmental Laws, we could be held liable, without regard to fault, for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations. We could also be held responsible for third-party property and personal injury claims or for violations of Environmental Laws relating to contamination. We are a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under Environmental Laws, including as a potentially responsible party in several Superfund site cleanups. Based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties, the total estimated cleanup costs and other financially viable potentially responsible parties, we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material, either individually or in the aggregate. We have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs.

However, certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves. These events include, but are not limited to: a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements; undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties; and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs.
