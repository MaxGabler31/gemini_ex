Item 1. BUSINESS
HISTORY OF OUR COMPANY
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company’s business plan is to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions. Our current operations are focused on our online store, GCC Superstore.
 
Our principal executive office is located at The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, and our telephone number is (727) 482-1505.
 
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS
 
The Company’s business segments are divided into four operating segments:
 
1. E-commerce- Through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, GCC Superstore, LLC, the Company has established an online store whose merchandise includes pipes, vaporizers, grinders, hemp related products, CBD (Cannabidiol) related products and additional products focusing on the cannabis industry. The online store, GCC Superstore, was opened in June 2017 and can be found at www.gccsuperstore.com. At present, the GCC Superstore carries in excess of 1000 products from 20 suppliers and over 50 brands. The online store operates under a “drop-ship” model which affords it the benefit of less capital expenditure on inventory. Please see NOTE K - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS for further information.


2. Advertising- With the development of the GCC Superstore, the Company will place directed advertising throughout the online store. Advertising will originate through Google AdSense or direct-advertising sales by the Company. The company will also use social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in an effort to attract customers with product specific advertisements or posts.
 
3. Licensing- The Company is actively seeking licensing opportunities in the cannabis sector, for intellectual property, products and dispensary means. At present, the Company does not have any active licensing agreements. On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Artemis Dispensing Technologies for the development and resell of an automated dispensing product. Under the collaboration and license agreement, Artemis was to be responsible for the development of a high end automated dispensing product. Upon launch and sales of the product, Artemis was to be responsible for the installation, training and customer support for the hardware and software. The Company was to be responsible for direct sales, addition of key distributors and sublicensing of specific territories within the U.S. The initial term of the Agreement expired December 31, 2016 and in the opinion of management the Agreement is no longer in effect. Please see NOTE C-ARTEMIS LICENSING AGREEMENT for further information.
 
4. Direct Investments- The Company may, at its election, directly invest in private entities within the cannabis sector either through stock purchase agreements, debentures, joint ventures or a hybrid of each. The Company’s planned investments will focus on those entities whose near-term goals are to maximum shareholder value through the filing of an initial public offering or a corporate event that takes the entity from private to public. Investments will be made through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary GCC Investment Holdings, LLC.

The GCC Superstore
 
GCC Superstore Store
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. operates the GCC Superstore, an online store built on the Shopify platform. Visitors are able to order pipes, vaporizers, CBD products and other hemp and cannabis related products by selecting the products they would like to order, entering their shipping and billing information and confirming the order. The GCC Superstore is part of the Company’s primary business plan. The Company intends on aggressively expanding its product line over the next two quarters. As a drop-ship business model, the Company is not required to acquire excessive inventory.
 
The GCC Superstore is accessible at the Company’s a website, www.GCCSuperstore.com. The Company is currently in the process of developing an app as a free mobile application which can be downloaded through the iOS APP Store or the Google Play Marketplace. The Company anticipates that the mobile app will be fully developed and ready for download during the second quarter of 2018. There is no guarantee that either marketplace will approve the downloading of the Company’s app due to the nature of our business.
 
Background GCC Superstore, LLC
 
On January 9, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to file Articles of Organization to form a new entity, GCC Superstore, LLC. The Articles of Organization were filed with the State of Florida on January 13, 2017 with a requested effective date of January 9, 2017. The GCC Superstore, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
In June 2017, we launched our online store, GCC Superstore, with limited merchandise such as pipes, vaporizers, CDB, hemp and cannabis related products.
 
As an online retail store operating under a drop-ship model, GCC Superstore is able to rapidly scale its products and services with minimal marginal costs - each additional brand, category or product that we add to our platform adds negligible server hosting costs. It also allows us to have a virtual presence and exposure to every regulated cannabis market without establishing a costly physical presence in each state. This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.
 
GCC Superstore, LLC Products
 
Currently, our products at our online store, GCC Superstore, consist of approximately 1000 SKU’s from 20 suppliers and in excess of 50 brands. Some of the more well-known brands we carry are Atmos, Green Flash Glass, Boundless, Cloud, Exxus, Santa Cruz, Grav, Cali Crusher just to name a few. Our business model consists of two revenue streams through the GCC Superstore. The first is through our direct customer sales and the second is through our business advertising portal throughout the GCC Superstore.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s revenue was negatively impacted due to the termination of its former merchant agreement through the Shopify platform. The Company’s former merchant vendor elected to terminate the agreement due to certain products that the GCC Superstore carried and sold. The Company has identified a new merchant vendor that will permit the GCC Superstore to carry certain products such as CBD and Kratom. Once fully implemented, sales transactions can be completed on the GCC Superstore.
 
Employees and Consultants
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. has 1 part-time employee, and two part-time independent contractors. The Company has utilized the services of two web development firms to build out the GCC Superstore. The Company’s current President, Wayne Anderson, also serves in the role of another publicly traded company, Sylios Corp. The Company anticipates that it will need to retain the services of additional management and key personnel in the near future to further its business plan.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive offices are now located at 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701. Our registered office in Florida is located at 244 2nd Ave N., Suite 9, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, and our registered agent is our former parent company, Sylios Corp.
Market Conditions
 
The cannabis industry continues to exceed other industries’ growth rates and retain the title of the “fastest-growing industry in the U.S.” as the Huffington Post reported in 2015.
 
Marijuana sales in North America reached $6.73 billion in 2016, reflecting 34% growth over 2015 ($5.04 billion), according to ArcView Market Research/BDS Analytics. The research firm projects sales to jump to $21.6 billion by 2021, representing a 26% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
 
While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces four major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there will be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. Third, the majority of states do not allow access to medical cannabis for its patients. This presents an obstacle to the medical cannabis industry and requires financial resources and dedicated advocacy to change regulations on the state level. Fourth, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.

Government Regulations
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this filing, 28 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA (see “-The Cole Memo”). In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations (see “-FinCEN”).
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, prohibits the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with medical cannabis laws from implementing such laws. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment is effective through April 28, 2017, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually. The Compassionate Access Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the “CARERS Act”) has been introduced in the U.S. Senate, which proposes to reclassify cannabis under the CSA to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. More recently, the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which proposes to exclude persons who produce, possess, distribute, dispense, administer or deliver marijuana in compliance with state laws from the regulatory controls and administrative, civil and criminal penalties of the CSA.
 
However, as of the date of this filing, neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 has been enacted, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has not yet been renewed beyond April 28, 2017, and the new administration under President Trump has not yet indicated whether it will change the previously stated policy of low-priority enforcement of federal laws related to cannabis set forth in the Cole Memo or the FinCEN Guidelines. The Trump administration could change this policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government. However, as of the date of this filing, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. As a result of our providing ancillary products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law.
 
Absent any future changes in cannabis-related policies under the Trump administration, we intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see “-The Cole Memo”) and the FinCEN Guidelines (see “-FinCEN”), where applicable; however, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidelines or any applicable federal laws or regulations.

Cole Memo
 
Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of the DOJ’s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.
 
The Cole Memo reiterates Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that the DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that the DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
● | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
● | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
● | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
The Cole Memo is meant only as a guide for United States Attorneys and does not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. We believe we have implemented procedures and policies to ensure we are operating in compliance with the “Cole Memo”. However, we cannot provide assurance that our actions are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations. Per The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. and that of its wholly owned subsidiary, GCC Superstore, LLC, Terms and Conditions:
 

● | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is legal; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Users must be of legal age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); 
● | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws; 
● | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. or its GCC Superstore; 
● | Posting of any other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills, is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
● | Posting of any violence or threat of violence is prohibited and will result in account termination; 
● | Posting of any drugged-driving content is prohibited and will result in account termination; and 
● | Posting of any copyright-protected content is prohibited and will result in account termination.

We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. When an account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the GCC Superstore until further review. The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the Customer’s account.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our website which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo. However, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Rohrabacher Farr Amendment
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision known as the “Rohrabacher Farr Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015 and remains in effect currently.
 
The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Rohrabacher Farr Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws - and has continued to sporadically commence enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being legal under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Rohrabacher Farr Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
Potential Changes to Federal Laws and Enforcement Priorities
 
Although the Department of Justice has stated in the Cole Memo that it is not an efficient use of limited resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis, there is no guarantee that the Department of Justice’s position will not change regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Further, the United States has a new administration in 2017, which could introduce a less favorable cannabis enforcement policy. There can be no assurances that any future administration would not change the current enforcement policy and decide to strongly enforce the federal laws.
 
In light of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Gonzales v. Raich, under the commerce clause of the constitution, Congress may pass laws to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states have approved its use for medicinal purposes, which leads to the conclusion that the Controlled Substances Act may preempt state laws relating to any cannabis-related activity. Any such change in the federal enforcement program of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to our business. While we do not directly harvest, distribute, or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.

THE GREATER CANNABIS COMPANY, INC.
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 For the period ended December 31, 2017
 
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Nature of Operations
 
The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc. was formed in March 2014 as a limited liability company under the name, The Greater Cannabis Company, LLC. The Company remained a wholly owned subsidiary of Sylios Corp until March 2017. The Company’s business plan is to concentrate on cannabis related investment and development opportunities through its online retail store, direct equity investments, joint ventures, licensing agreements or acquisitions.
 
The Company’s business model is divided into four operating segments through the Company’s three wholly owned subsidiaries; Bud Bank, Inc., GCC Superstore, LLC and GCC Investment Holdings, LLC:
 
1. E-commerce- Through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, GCC Superstore, LLC, the Company has established an online store whose merchandise includes pipes, vaporizers, grinders, hemp related products, CBD (Cannabidiol) related products and additional products focusing on the cannabis industry. The online store, GCC Superstore, was opened in June 2017 and can be found at www.gccsuperstore.com. At present, the GCC Superstore carries in excess of 1000 products from 20 suppliers and over 50 brands. The online store operates under a “drop-ship” model which affords it the benefit of less capital expenditure on inventory. Please see NOTE K - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS for further information.


2. Advertising- With the development of the GCC Superstore, the Company will place directed advertising throughout the online store. Advertising will originate through Google AdSense or direct-advertising sales by the Company. The company will also use social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in an effort to attract customers with product specific advertisements or posts.
 
3. Licensing- The Company is actively seeking licensing opportunities in the cannabis sector, for intellectual property, products and dispensary means. At present, the Company does not have any active licensing agreements. On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Artemis Dispensing Technologies for the development and resell of an automated dispensing product. Under the collaboration and license agreement, Artemis was to be responsible for the development of a high end automated dispensing product. Upon launch and sales of the product, Artemis was to be responsible for the installation, training and customer support for the hardware and software. The Company was to be responsible for direct sales, addition of key distributors and sublicensing of specific territories within the U.S. The initial term of the Agreement expired December 31, 2016 and in the opinion of management the Agreement is no longer in effect. Please see NOTE C- ARTEMIS LICENSING AGREEMENT for further information.
 
4. Direct Investments- The Company may, at its election, directly invest in private entities within the cannabis sector either through stock purchase agreements, debentures, joint ventures or a hybrid of each through its wholly owned subsidiary GCC Investment Holdings, LLC. The Company’s planned investments will focus on those entities whose near-term goals are to maximum shareholder value through the filing of an initial public offering or a corporate event that takes the entity from private to public. Investments will be made through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary GCC Investment Holdings, LLC.
 
On July 31, 2014, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Artemis Dispensing Technologies (“Artemis”) for the development and resell of an automated dispensing product. Under the collaboration and license agreement, Artemis was to be responsible for the development of a high end automated dispensing product. Upon launch and sales of the product, Artemis was to be responsible for the installation, training and customer support for the hardware and software. The Company was to be responsible for direct sales, addition of key distributors and sublicensing of specific territories within the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company was to pay to Artemis a licensing fee in the total amount of $500,000.00 broken into tranches and based on development parameters. Artemis was to receive a percentage of transaction fees generated on a monthly basis per unit. The Company was to receive revenue generated directly from sales either though its website or sales staff, a royalty from sales generated through third party vendors/distributors or a percentage of any sub-licenses sold. In addition, the Company was to have the first right of refusal to purchase a license for the use of the same technology in other countries. The initial term of the Agreement expired December 31, 2016 and in the opinion of management the Agreement is no longer in effect. Please see NOTE C- ARTEMIS LICENSING AGREEMENT for additional information.

THE GREATER CANNABIS COMPANY, INC.
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 For the period ended December 31, 2017
 
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Greater Cannabis Company, Inc., and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Bud Bank, Inc., GCC Superstore, LLC and GCC Investment Holdings, LLC. On March 10, 2017, the Company was spun-off from its former parent company, Sylios Corp, in a stock dividend. Please see NOTE A- BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Spin-off) for further information). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Presentation 
 
The accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial statements and in the opinion of management contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2016, and the results of its operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. These statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the information contained herein. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for future interim periods or for the full year ending December 31, 2017.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash are considered to be cash equivalents. For the period ended December 31, 2017, the Company had no cash equivalents.
Marketable Equity Securities
 
Marketable equity securities are stated at lower of cost or market value with unrealized gains and losses included in operations. The Company has classified its marketable equity securities as trading securities.
Income Taxes
 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740 - Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method measures deferred income taxes by applying enacted statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts on the financial statements. The resulting deferred tax assets or liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws as they occur. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
 
We expect to recognize the financial statement benefit of an uncertain tax position only after considering the probability that a tax authority would sustain the position in an examination. For tax positions meeting a “more-likely-than-not” threshold, the amount to be recognized in the financial statements will be the benefit expected to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority. For tax positions not meeting the threshold, no financial statement benefit is recognized. As of December 31, 2017, we had no uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as general and administrative expenses. We currently have no federal or state tax examinations nor have we had any federal or state examinations since our inception. To date, we have not incurred any interest or tax penalties.

Recently Enacted Accounting Standards
 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. As amended by the FASB in July 2015, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our future financial statements.
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to provide guidance on recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements, specifically differentiating between different types of leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous GAAP. There continues to be a differentiation between finance leases and operating leases. However, the principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should be recognized in the balance sheet. The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged from that applied under previous GAAP. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. An entity that elects to apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous GAAP unless the lease is modified, except that lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all operating leases at each reporting date based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments that were tracked and disclosed under previous GAAP. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its financial statements.
 
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations, to clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 (discussed above). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its financial statements.
 
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, to clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: 1) identifying performance obligations, and 2) the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of ASU 2014-09 (discussed above). The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its financial statements.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 For the period ended December 31, 2017
 
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consists primarily of trade accounts receivable from a variety of local, national and international oil and natural gas companies. Such credit risk is considered by management to be limited due to the financial resources of those oil and natural gas companies.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
We adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC Topic 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing US GAAP that requires the use of fair value measurements that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.
 
ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC Topic 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:
 

Level 1: | Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2: | Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
Level 3: | Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions. 

 
The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. We had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods.
 
Derivative Liabilities
 
We evaluate stock options, stock warrants or other contracts to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for under the relevant sections of ASC Topic 815-40, Derivative Instruments and Hedging: Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity.
 
The result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity. Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

Long-lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment. We test for impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairment evaluations involve management’s estimates on asset useful lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management which could have a material effect on our reporting results and financial positions. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.
Website Development Costs
 
Website development costs are expensed as incurred. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, website development expense was $4,305 and $0, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, website development expense was $390 and $0, respectively.
Deferred Financing Costs
 
Deferred financing costs represent costs incurred in the connection with obtaining debt financing. These costs are amortized ratably and charged to financing expenses over the term of the related debt.
 
Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring Goods or Services
 
Issuances of our common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a “performance commitment” which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete.
 
Although situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time, the equity award granted to the party performing the service is fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a result, in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist if the instruments are fully vested on the date of agreement, we determine such date to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to expense over the contract period. When it is appropriate for us to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current fair values.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We account for share-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”. Under this guidance, stock compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the estimated service period (generally the vesting period) on the straight-line attribute method. Share-based awards to non-employees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 505-50 “Equity”, wherein such awards are expensed over the period in which the related services are rendered.

Related Parties
 
A party is considered to be related to us if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. Related parties also include our principal owners, our management, members of the immediate families of our principal owners and our management and other parties with which we may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties, or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, is also a related party.
Revenue Recognition
 
Revenue from product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the price is fixed or determinable, (3) collectability is reasonably assured, and (4) delivery has occurred.
Advertising Costs
 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the periods presented, we had no advertising costs.
 
Loss per Share
 
We compute net loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260. The ASC specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for loss per share for entities with publicly held common stock.
 
Basic loss per share amounts is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock options, warrants and convertible securities) outstanding. Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net loss per share are excluded from the calculation.
 
NOTE B - GOING CONCERN
 
Under ASC 205-40, we have the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. As required by this standard, our evaluation shall initially not take into consideration the potential mitigating effects of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.
 
In performing the first step of this assessment, we concluded that the following conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to meet our financial obligations as they become due. We have a history of net losses: for the period ended December 31, 2017, we had a cumulative net loss of $902,355. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we provided $4,670 cash from operating activities. As of December 31, 2017, we had $993 in cash available to fund operations. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until such time as our operating segments generate sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements (which debt service approximates $180,000 through November 20, 2018).

NOTE B - GOING CONCERN (continued)
 
In performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships, establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities, including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM).
 
There is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing shareholders. We have therefore concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through November 20, 2018.
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
NOTE C - ARTEMIS LICENSING AGREEMENT
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company was to pay Artemis a licensing fee of $500,000 payable as follows: (1) $100,000 upon execution of the Agreement (which was paid to Artemis in August 2014), (2) $100,000 in 60 days, (3) $100,000 upon Artemis’ delivery of a functioning prototype, and (4) $200,000 after delivery of the prototype. Due to a lack of funds, the Company failed to pay the $100,000 due within 60 days of the July 31, 2014 Agreement date. Artemis failed to deliver any prototype of the dispensing product to the Company. The initial term of the Agreement expired December 31, 2016 and in the opinion of management the Agreement is no longer in effect.
 
On December 31, 2016 (expiration date of the initial term of the Agreement), the Company reduced the carrying value of the Artemis Licensing Agreement capitalized costs from $100,000 to $0 and recognized an expense provision for nonrecoverability of Artemis License Agreement costs of $100,000.

The Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Note”) and the warrants contain obligations to reduce the conversion price of the Note and the exercise price of the Warrants in the event that the Company sells, grants or issues any non-excluded shares, options, warrants or any convertible instrument at a price below the conversion price of the Note and the exercise price of the Warrants (“ratchet-down” provisions). The Notes also contain a variable conversion feature based on the future trading price of the Company’s common stock. Therefore, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the Warrants is indeterminate. Accordingly, we have recorded the fair value of the embedded conversion and exercise features as a derivative liability at the respective issuance dates (total of $222,585 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017) and charged a total of $62,500 to debt discounts and a total of $147,447 to other expense.
