Item 1. Business 
Overview
Front Yard Residential (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Front Yard” or the “Company”) is an industry leader in providing quality, affordable rental homes to America’s families in a variety of suburban communities that have easy accessibility to metropolitan areas. Our tenants enjoy the space and comfort that is unique to single-family housing, at reasonable prices. Our mission is to provide our tenants with houses they are proud to call home.
We are a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”), and we conduct substantially all of our activities through our wholly owned subsidiary, Front Yard Residential, L.P., and its subsidiaries (the “Operating Partnership”). We commenced operations in December 2012. We operate in a single segment focused on the acquisition and ownership of residential rental properties.
We are managed by Altisource Asset Management Corporation (“AAMC” or our “Manager”). AAMC provides us with dedicated personnel to administer our business and perform certain of our corporate governance functions. AAMC also provides portfolio management services in connection with our acquisition and management of single-family rental (“SFR”) properties and the management of our remaining residential mortgage loans and real estate owned (“REO”) properties. We have been operating under the current asset management agreement (the “AMA”) with AAMC since April 1, 2015.
On August 8, 2018, we acquired HavenBrook Partners, LLC (“HavenBrook” or our “internal property manager”), a full-service property management company and a Delaware limited liability company, as well as the 3,236 homes managed by HavenBrook (the “RHA Acquired Properties”). The acquisition of HavenBrook provides us with an internal property manager and an efficient, scalable property management platform that is designed to provide tenants with excellent service. As we continue to grow, this platform will to allow us to benefit from economies of scale that will enhance long-term stockholder value. We refer to this transaction as the “HB Acquisition.” Prior to the HB Acquisition, we relied exclusively on two external property management vendors, Main Street Renewal, LLC (“MSR”) and Altisource S.à r.l. (“ASPS”), to provide, among other things, leasing and lease management, operations, maintenance, repair and property management services in respect of certain of our SFR properties.
Upon the acquisition of HavenBrook, we commenced the internalization of our property management function, and we expect that substantially all of our single-family rental assets will be managed by HavenBrook by March 31, 2019. On August 8, 2018, we amended our property management service agreement with ASPS to, among other things, move all homes managed by ASPS onto our internal property management platform. The transition of homes away from ASPS was completed in November 2018, and, as of December 31, 2018, ASPS no longer serves as our property manager. On December 7, 2018, we also amended our property management service agreements with MSR (the “MSR Termination Agreements”) to provide for the transition of the SFR properties managed by MSR to our internal property management platform. As of February 21, 2019, we managed 12,868 properties on our internal property management platform.
Since we commenced operations in 2012, we have financed our business through a combination of equity offerings, term loans, repurchase agreements, warehouse lines, seller financing arrangements and securitizations.
Our Business Strategy
We are committed to being one of the top SFR REITs serving American families and their communities with a view to providing consistent and robust returns on equity and long-term growth for our investors. Our portfolio of SFR properties has grown substantially in recent years. The HB Acquisition and subsequent internalization of our property management function has provided us with additional opportunities to deliver an excellent tenant experience and manage our rental homes efficiently and in line with our key operating targets.
We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the SFR market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan to capitalize on the sustained growth in SFR demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market to acquire rental properties, which, in our view, not only provide safe, comfortable homes for our residents, but also offer attractive yield opportunities.
We expect to hold SFR property assets over the long term with a focus on developing our brand. We also believe that, given the limited institutional penetration to date into the SFR marketplace, our ability to acquire and effectively manage assets with

attractive yields in strategic markets provides us with a significant opportunity to establish ourselves as a leading SFR equity REIT.
From an operational standpoint, we have established an extensive renovation and property management infrastructure that provides us with geographic reach and a scalable property management structure that will allow us to grow in a cost-efficient manner.
Acquisition Strategy
Through our judicious use of cash, strong financing relationships and the sale of non-core assets, we have capitalized on opportunities to buy large portfolios and smaller pools of stabilized rental homes and individual residential properties at attractive yields. We continue to have access to funding and may execute upon acquisition opportunities as they become available.
We have been successful in our pursuit of this strategy to date, having increased our SFR portfolio to approximately 15,000 homes as of December 31, 2018 from approximately 3,000 at December 31, 2015. We expect to continue to opportunistically source, bid on and acquire SFR properties that meet our targeted metrics over the course of 2019.
Internalization of Scalable Property Management Platform
The HB Acquisition provides us with an efficient, scalable internal property management platform that provides tenants with excellent service and allows us to benefit from economies of scale. With HavenBrook, we have direct, internally managed control of leasing, renovation and turn management, vendor management, market analysis and other property management support functions, which will enhance our ability to control costs and generate long-term returns to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, we had 140 employees who serviced 7,400 homes in 23 MSAs across 16 states, and we work directly with over 300 vendors providing services to our homes with capacity to process over 500 turns per month. When the remaining SFR properties serviced by MSR are transitioned to our internal platform, we will directly service approximately 15,000 homes.
The transition to internal property management has also provided us with the opportunity to develop our brand and enhance the tenant experience. Our property manager has allowed us to develop a unified approach to renovation management, repair and maintenance, vendor contracting and material supply chain management in an effort to create a consistent look and feel for our SFR properties. Over time, we expect to develop a nationally recognized brand that is known for consistent quality at affordable prices.
This internal property management platform is driven by proprietary technology solutions that support tenant experience and enhance operational efficiency and performance. In addition to in-house technicians, efficient back-office support evaluates and solicits the appropriate external vendors to perform required work, assigns the work to the vendor with the best possible combination of cost and delivery capabilities, provides uniform property management and inspection criteria and utilizes technology to review and assess properties. We believe this technology-driven property management infrastructure will result in increased long-term value for our stockholders.
Real Estate Portfolio Overview
Acquisitions
We seek to acquire SFR properties with attractive return profiles. Our SFR portfolio was acquired through direct purchases of SFR and REO properties as well as through the resolution of non-performing mortgage loans we had previously acquired. Our significant acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following:

• | On August 8, 2018, we completed the purchase of 3,236 SFR properties and an internal property manager in the HB Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of $485.0 million.


• | On March 30, 2017, we entered into an agreement to acquire up to 3,500 SFR properties (the “HOME Flow Transaction”) from entities sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (“Amherst”), pursuant to which we acquired 3,465 SFR properties in three separate closings during 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $528.7 million.


• | On September 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 4,262 SFR properties (the “HOME SFR Transaction”) from two investment funds sponsored by Amherst for an aggregate purchase price of $652.3 million.


• | On March 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 590 SFR properties located in five states from a third party seller for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $64.8 million.

• | In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we acquired 70, 27 and 714 rental properties, respectively, on an individual basis.

Dispositions
We expect to continue to liquidate (i) certain rental properties that are non-strategic, underperforming or are in inefficient markets and (ii) the remaining REO properties that were acquired through mortgage loan resolution activities that do not meet our rental criteria in order to generate cash for reinvestment in other acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, pay down debt, dividend distributions or such other purposes as we may determine.
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we sold 448, 1,710 and 2,668 REO properties, respectively, that did not meet our rental investment criteria. We have utilized a significant portion of the net proceeds from these sales to acquire additional SFR properties for our rental portfolio.
On February 8, 2019, we completed the sale of 444 properties that did not meet our investment criteria for an aggregate sales price of $102.9 million to a third party purchaser. In connection with this sale, we expect to recognize a net realized gain of $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2019.

If an REO property does not meet our rental investment criteria, the property is listed for sale, in some instances after renovations are made to optimize the sale proceeds.
As of December 31, 2017, we had 12,574 properties, consisting of 12,241 properties held for use and 333 properties held for sale. Of the 12,241 properties held for use, 10,850 had been leased, 591 were listed and ready for rent, 340 were in unit turn status, 194 were in various stages of renovation and 69 were being prepared for future disposal.

(1) | The carrying value of an asset held for use is based on historical cost plus renovation costs, net of any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.


(2) | The carrying value of certain properties acquired on November 29, 2017 are included based upon the initial purchase price, certain of which are subject to potential purchase price adjustment provisions as set forth in the purchase and sale agreement. For additional information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Potential purchase price adjustments under the HOME Flow Transaction.

As of December 31, 2018, our highest concentrations of SFR properties were in four states, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, which accounted for 9,911 properties (68.1% of our SFR portfolio) with an aggregate carrying value of $1.3 billion (67.0% of the carrying value of our SFR portfolio), with the remainder dispersed among 30 other states.
Our Strengths
We are committed to a business strategy that will enable us to efficiently manage and continue to grow our portfolio of affordable rental homes and become one of the largest nationwide SFR REITs. Our goal is to enhance long-term stockholder value through the execution of our business plan with a focus on our competitive strengths. Our strong competitive position is based on the following factors:

• | Acquisition Strategy Enables us to Continue Building a Portfolio that Targets Attractive Yields to Stockholders. Through AAMC’s personnel and technical expertise, we have developed a disciplined market and asset selection approach and a valuation model that uses proprietary and market data to evaluate and project the performance of SFR assets. This valuation model has been built with multiple broad economic and geographic inputs as well as numerous property-level inputs to determine which properties will produce attractive yields and how much to pay for these properties to best achieve optimal results. These internally developed tools help us to evaluate the most attractive SFR portfolios for sale. We also leverage our property inspection, management and rental infrastructure and related data flows to identify and acquire attractive assets in the geographical locations into which we desire to grow. We intend to continue to build our internal property management infrastructure, which will allow us to focus on strategic geographical areas, develop regional experience to continually refine our acquisition strategy and achieve rental portfolio growth with properties marked by strong stabilized occupancy rates and optimal economic returns. We also believe that our focus on affordable housing provides us with a potential advantage, as we believe this is an underserved market segment that provides us with attractive yield and growth opportunities.

(table of contents)


• | Extensive Internal Property Management Infrastructure. With our internal property manager and the support of our growing nationwide vendor networks, we believe that we are well positioned to operate and manage SFR properties across the United States at an attractive cost structure. The HB Acquisition has provided us with an excellent, experienced property management team with a successful track-record of internal property management operations and enables us to capitalize on additional opportunities to enhance our tenants’ experience and improve our operating efficiency for our entire portfolio. We believe that our new internal property management infrastructure provides us with a cost-efficient, scalable platform that will be a key factor in our success as we continue to grow.


• | Depth of Management Experience. We believe the experience and technical expertise of our management team is one of our key strengths. Our team has a broad and deep knowledge of the real estate market with decades of experience in real estate, mortgage trading, housing, financial services and asset management. Their experience in the real estate industry brings a wealth of understanding of the markets in which we operate and can help us build our portfolio in a manner that brings attractive potential returns to stockholders. Management and its supporting teams have expertise and extensive contacts that enable us to source SFR assets through access to auctions and sellers of SFR assets and obtain financing to optimize available leverage. Due to our management team's expertise, we have been able to strategically sell non-core assets to sustain a strong dividend while also using the liquidity generated from these sales to increase the size of our SFR portfolio. We believe that AAMC’s asset evaluation process and the experience and judgment of its executive management team in identifying, assessing, valuing and acquiring new SFR assets will help us to appropriately value the portfolios at the time of purchase and operate them profitably as we continue to grow.

Our Investment Process
Our Manager continues to provide personnel and portfolio managers with substantial experience in the real estate market. Using extensive market connections and a disciplined market and asset selection approach incorporating advanced quantitative models, AAMC's capital markets group has demonstrated expertise in sourcing, analyzing and negotiating the purchase of both large and small portfolios of rented single-family properties. Through close collaboration by AAMC with our internal property management team, we are able to source and acquire properties that fit our investment strategy and integrate well with our property management infrastructure. This expertise and coordination has enabled us to strategically grow our SFR portfolio to approximately 15,000 homes, the majority of which were stabilized rentals at the time of acquisition.
Our Financing Strategy
We intend to continue to finance our real estate investments with debt and equity, the proportions and character of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and on market conditions. To the extent available at the relevant time, our financing sources may include bank credit facilities, term financing, warehouse lines of credit, securitization financing, seller financing arrangements, structured financing arrangements and repurchase agreements, among others. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, depending upon market conditions. For additional information on our financing arrangements, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Optimization of Financing in 2018” and “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Repurchase and Loan Agreements.”
Investment Committee and Investment Policy
Substantially all of our investment activities are conducted by AAMC on our behalf pursuant to the AMA. Our principal objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long-term through dividends and capital appreciation.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a broad investment policy designed to facilitate the management of our capital and assets and the maintenance of an investment portfolio profile that meets our objectives. Our Board has appointed an Investment Committee consisting of our Chairman of the Board, two independent Board members, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. The Investment Committee's role is to act in accordance with the investment policy and guidelines approved by our Board of Directors for the investment of our capital. As part of an overall investment portfolio strategy, the investment policy provides that we can purchase or sell real estate assets, non-performing or sub-performing residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities. We are also authorized to offer leases on acquired SFR properties. The investment policy may be modified by our Board of Directors without the approval of our stockholders.
5

(table of contents)

The objective of the investment policy is to oversee our efforts to achieve a return on assets consistent with our business objectives and to maintain adequate liquidity to meet financial covenants and regular cash requirements.
The Investment Committee is authorized to approve the financing of our investment positions through bank credit facilities, seller financing arrangements, warehouse lines of credit, securitization financing, term financing, structured financing arrangements and repurchase agreements, among others, provided such agreements are negotiated with counterparties approved by the Investment Committee. We are also permitted to hedge our interest rate exposure on our financing activities through the use of interest rate swaps or caps, forwards, futures and options, subject to prior approval from the Investment Committee.
Investment Committee Approval of Counterparties
The Investment Committee is authorized to consider and approve:

• | the financial soundness of institutions with which we plan to transact business and make recommendations with respect thereto;


• | our risk exposure limits with respect to the dollar amounts of total exposure with a given institution; and


• | investment accounts and trading accounts to be opened with banks, broker-dealers and financial institutions.

Investment Committee Guidelines
The activities of our Investment Committee are subject to the following guidelines:

• | No investment will be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | No investment will be made that would cause us to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”); and


• | Until appropriate investments can be identified, we may invest available cash in interest-bearing and short-term investments that are consistent with (a) our intention to qualify as a REIT and (b) our exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Broad Investment Policy Risks
Our investment policy is very broad and provides our Investment Committee and AAMC with extensive latitude to determine the types of assets that are appropriate investments for us and to make individual investment decisions. In the future, AAMC may make investments with lower rates of return than those anticipated under current market conditions and/or may make investments with greater risks to achieve those anticipated returns. Our Board of Directors will periodically review our investment policy and our investment portfolio but will not typically review or approve each proposed investment by AAMC unless, for example, it falls outside our previously approved investment policy or constitutes a related party transaction.
In addition, in conducting its periodic reviews, our Board of Directors will rely primarily on information provided to it by AAMC, and the Board has delegated the oversight of certain investment decisions to the Investment Committee, which includes our Chairman of the Board of Directors. AAMC may use complex strategies, and transactions entered into by AAMC may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind. Further, we may change our investment policy and targeted asset classes at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different in type from, and possibly riskier than, our current investments or the investments currently contemplated. Changes in our investment strategy, investment policy and targeted asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, counterparty risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could materially and adversely affect us.
Our Manager and the Asset Management Agreement
We are externally managed by AAMC, an asset management company that provides portfolio management and corporate governance services. Under the AMA, AAMC is responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering certain of our day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in our investment policy in cooperation with our Board of Directors; (3) sourcing, analyzing and executing asset acquisitions, including the related financing activities; (4) overseeing the renovation, leasing and property management of our SFR properties performed by our internal and external property managers; (5) analyzing and executing sales of REO properties and residential mortgage loans; (6) overseeing the servicing of our remaining residential mortgage loans; (7) performing asset management duties and (8) performing corporate governance and other management functions, including financial, accounting and tax management services.
6

(table of contents)

AAMC provides us with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential properties and residential mortgage loans. AAMC’s management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables it to manage our business and organizational structure efficiently. AAMC has agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of our Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against us in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets, (b) the carrying on of an SFR business or (c) any other activity in which we engage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AAMC may engage in any other business or render similar or different services to any businesses engaged in lending or insurance activities or any other activity other than those described above. Further, at any time following our determination and announcement that we will no longer engage in any of the above-described competitive activities, AAMC would be entitled to provide advisory or other services to businesses or entities in such competitive activities without our prior consent.
On March 31, 2015, we entered into the current AMA with AAMC. The AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for the following management fee structure that replaces the fee structure:

• | Base Management Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly base management fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) our average invested capital (as defined in the AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25 while we have fewer than 2,500 SFR properties actually rented (“Rental Properties”). The base management fee percentage increases to 1.75% of average invested capital while we have between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of average invested capital while we have 4,500 or more Rental Properties;


• | Incentive Management Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly incentive management fee equal to 20% of the amount by which our return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as our net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all of our real estate assets owned) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). The incentive management fee increases to 22.5% while we have between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while we have 4,500 or more Rental Properties. We have the flexibility to pay up to 25% of any incentive management fee payment to AAMC in shares of our common stock; and


• | Conversion Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly conversion fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by us for the first time during the quarter.

Because we have more than 4,500 Rental Properties, AAMC is entitled to receive a base management fee of 2.0% of our invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which we exceed our then-required return on invested capital threshold.
Under the AMA, we reimburse AAMC for the compensation and benefits of the General Counsel dedicated to us and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by AAMC on our behalf.
Under the AMA, AAMC continues to be the exclusive asset manager for us for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to our achieving an average annual return on invested capital during the initial term of at least 7.0%. Neither party is entitled to terminate the AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination (a) by us and/or AAMC “for cause” for certain events such as a material breach of the AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) by us for certain other reasons such as our failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the AMA or (c) by us in connection with certain change of control events.
If the AMA were terminated by AAMC, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth could be materially adversely affected.
Manager’s Management of the Operating Partnership
General
Substantially all of our assets are and will be held by, and substantially all of our operations are and will be conducted through, the Operating Partnership, either directly or through its subsidiaries or Delaware statutory trusts for its benefit. Front Yard Residential GP, LLC is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership (the “General Partner”). We own 100% of the membership interests in the General Partner. We also own 100% of the limited partnership interests of the Operating 
7

(table of contents)

Partnership. We do not intend to list any Operating Partnership interests on any exchange or any national market system. The provisions of the limited partnership agreement are described below.
The General Partner is managed by AAMC through our asset management agreement with AAMC. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the limited partnership agreement and subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of operating partnership interests, all management powers over the business and affairs of the Operating Partnership are exclusively vested in AAMC through its management of us and the General Partner, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors. No limited partner, in its capacity as a limited partner, has any right to participate in or exercise control or management power over the Operating Partnership’s business and affairs other than through our Board of Directors’ oversight of AAMC’s executive officers who manage our business and that of the General Partner. With limited exceptions, the General Partner, through its management by AAMC, may execute, deliver and perform agreements and transactions on behalf of the Operating Partnership without the approval or consent of any limited partner.
Terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement
Capital Contributions, Profits and Losses and Distributions 
Neither the General Partner nor the limited partner is required to make any additional capital contribution to the Operating Partnership, although we intend to contribute funds generally from equity offerings, repurchase facilities, securitization financings or other financing arrangements into the Operating Partnership in order to (a) make additional acquisitions of SFR properties, (b) pay property management fees, mortgage loan servicing fees and other expenses related to the management of our assets, (c) conduct the renovation, leasing and property management services for SFR properties and (d) provide funds for general corporate purposes.
The profits and losses of the Operating Partnership shall be allocated in proportion to the capital contributions of the partners of the Operating Partnership.
At the time or times determined by the General Partner, the General Partner may cause the Operating Partnership to distribute any cash held by it that is not reasonably necessary for the operation of the Operating Partnership. If the General Partner determines that cash will be distributed, the cash available for distribution will be distributed to us, as the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership and sole contributor of all the funds in the Operating Partnership’s capital account. 
Restrictions on Transfer of Partnership Interests; Withdrawals
Any partner of the Operating Partnership may transfer all or any part of its interest in the Operating Partnership only with the consent of the General Partner. Because we are the only limited partner and control the General Partner, we do not expect to transfer our limited partnership interests for the foreseeable future.
No partner may withdraw from the Operating Partnership except pursuant to an amendment to the limited partnership agreement signed by all of the partners. The withdrawal of the limited partner, and admission of a new or substitute limited partner, as applicable, will be effective as of the date of any such amendment. Upon the withdrawal of any partner, the withdrawing partner shall, to the extent permitted by Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (“DRULPA”) be entitled to payment of the balance of its capital account and shall have no further right, interest or obligation of any kind whatsoever as a partner in the Operating Partnership. We do not intend to withdraw as a partner of the Operating Partnership for the foreseeable future.
Amendments; Admission of Additional Partners
Without our approval as the limited partner, the General Partner may amend, and may amend and restate, the limited partnership agreement. The General Partner may admit additional limited partners to the Operating Partnership. The admission of additional limited partners to the Operating Partnership may be accomplished by the amendment, or the amendment and restatement, of the limited partnership agreement without our consent, and, if required by DRULPA, the filing of an appropriate amendment of the Operating Partnership’s certificate of formation.

Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities
We intend to raise additional funds through equity offerings, debt financings (including bank credit facilities, seller financing arrangements, warehouse lines of credit, securitization financing, term financing, structured financing arrangements and repurchase agreements), the retention of cash flow (subject to REIT distribution requirements) or a combination of these methods. In the event that our Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate, at any time, subject to compliance with New York Stock Exchange listing requirements.
In addition, we have borrowed and intend to continue to borrow money to finance or refinance the acquisition of SFR properties and for general corporate purposes. Our investment policy, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to use leverage and the appropriate level of leverage will be based on AAMC’s assessment of a variety of factors, including our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, financing covenants, the cash flow generation capability of assets, the availability of credit on favorable terms, our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the unlevered yields on our assets, maintenance of our REIT qualification, applicable law and other factors as AAMC and/or our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our decision to use leverage will be at AAMC’s discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders. We are not restricted by our governing documents in the amount of leverage that we may use. 
As of the date of this report, we do not intend to invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We do not intend that our investments in securities will require us to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and we would intend to divest such securities before any such registration would be required. We do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers.
Our Board of Directors may change any of these policies without prior notice to, or the consent of, our stockholders.
REIT Qualification
We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013, and we currently expect to maintain this status for the foreseeable future. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our common stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our manner of operation enables us to meet these requirements. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the REIT taxable income we distribute to our stockholders.
Even though we elected to be taxed as a REIT, we are subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. A portion of our business is expected to be conducted through, and a portion of our income is expected to be earned in, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a “TRS”). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that the REIT cannot hold, may choose not to hold to maintain REIT compliance and/or cannot engage in directly. Additionally, a TRS may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. To maintain our REIT election, at the end of each quarter, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS. If our TRS generates net income, our TRS can declare dividends to us, which will be included in our taxable income and necessitate a distribution to our stockholders. Conversely, if we retain earnings at the TRS level, no distribution is required, and we can increase stockholders’ equity of the consolidated entity.
Exemption from Investment Company Act
We rely on the exception from the Investment Company Act set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company “any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses… (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” The SEC Staff generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to be available, at least 55% of an entity’s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as “qualifying interests,” and at least another 25% of the entity’s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with no more than 20% of the entity’s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). Any significant acquisition by us of non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets could cause us to meet the definitions of an “investment company.” If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to

register as an investment company if we are unable to dispose of the disqualifying assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Structure – We could be materially and adversely affected if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.”
Employees
With our acquisition of HavenBrook, we now have direct employees for the first time. As of December 31, 2018, we had 140 full-time employees. None of our personnel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
In addition, certain services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of AAMC and our service providers. Our Manager's employees undertake asset management functions on our behalf that include acquisitions, capital markets access, risk management, accounting, internal audit, corporate management and legal services. Each of our executive officers is an employee, officer or both of AAMC, and they are paid by AAMC. As of December 31, 2018, AAMC had 104 full-time employees, all dedicated to the operation of our business.
AAMC also employs a dedicated General Counsel for our company. Although he is not employed by us, his primary duties are to act as our General Counsel, and he reports to our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. We also direct and approve his compensation and reimburse AAMC for all costs associated with his employment.
Competition
We face competition from various sources for the acquisition of SFR properties. Our competition includes other REITs, hedge funds, developers, private equity funds and partnerships. To effectively compete, we rely upon our management team and their substantial industry expertise. We believe our relationship with AAMC and the terms of the AMA provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess the investment risks and determine appropriate pricing. We expect our current focus on directly acquiring SFR properties in our preferred market segments will continue to allow us to compete effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Our competitive position is also reliant on the management team and experienced personnel at our newly acquired internal property manager. Our internal property management platform has had a successful track record managing the properties it managed before the HB Acquisition, and we believe this platform has been built for scale and will enable us to capitalize on additional opportunities to enhance our tenants’ experience and improve our operating efficiency for our entire portfolio as it grows. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive pricing and other risks that we face. Our competitors may have greater resources and access to capital and higher risk tolerances than we have, may be able to pay higher prices for assets or may be willing to accept lower returns on investment. As the inventory of available SFR properties and related assets will fluctuate, the competition for assets and financing may increase.
We also face significant competition in the SFR market from other real estate companies, including REITs, investment companies, partnerships and developers. To effectively manage rental yield and occupancy levels, we will rely upon the ability of AAMC's management team and our internal property manager to supervise the renovation, yield management and property management services on our acquired properties. We also believe that our focus on affordable housing provides us with a potential advantage, as we are focused on providing a single-family option to residents who might not be able to afford or qualify for a mortgage, which we believe will result in lower tenant turnover. Despite these factors, some of our competitors' SFR properties may be of better quality, be in more desirable locations or have leasing terms more favorable than we offer. In addition, our ability to compete and meet our return objectives depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and liquidity of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, taxes and governmental regulations. Given the significant competition, complexity of the market, changing financial and economic conditions and evolving single-family tenant demographics and demands, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or managing SFR properties that satisfy our return objectives.

Environmental Matters
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could incur liabilities to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at our properties. Environmental laws can impose liability on an owner or operator of real property for the investigation and remediation of contamination at or migrating from such real property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property's value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination could adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or renovate the real estate or borrow using the real estate as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Approval
Outside of routine business filings, we do not believe it is necessary to obtain any government approval to operate our business.
Governmental Regulations
General
Certain of our properties are subject to the rules of the various Home Owners Associations (“HOAs”) where such properties are located. HOAs are private entities that regulate the activities of owners and occupants of, and levy assessments on, properties in a residential subdivision. HOA rules and regulations typically consist of various restrictions or guidelines regarding use and maintenance of the property. In addition, our properties are subject to various covenants and local laws and regulatory requirements, including permitting, licensing and zoning requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with such covenants, local laws and regulatory requirements and HOA rules and regulations, and we also require that our tenants agree to comply with such covenants, laws, ordinances and rules in their leases with Front Yard.
Fair Housing Act
The Fair Housing Act (“FHA”) and its state law counterparts and the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) and various state agencies, prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents or legal custodians, pregnant women and people securing custody of children under the age of 18), handicap or, in some states, financial capability. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the FHA and other regulations.
Broker Licensure
We affiliate with various brokers to serve in each state in which we operate, and we utilize both a centralized leasing team and third-party leasing agents who work with us to lease our homes. Brokerages are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the licensure of real estate brokers and affiliate brokers and set forth standards for, and prohibitions on, the conduct of real estate brokers. Such standards and prohibitions include, among others, those relating to fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, and advertising and consumer disclosures, as well as compliance with federal, state and local laws and programs for providing housing to low-income families. Under applicable state law, we generally have a duty to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of our affiliate brokerages.
