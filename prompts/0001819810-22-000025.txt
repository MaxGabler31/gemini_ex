Item 1. Business
Redwire is a leader in mission critical space solutions and high reliability components for the next generation space economy, with valuable intellectual property for solar power generation, in-space 3D printing and manufacturing, avionics, critical components, sensors, digital engineering and space-based biotechnology. We combine decades of flight heritage with the agile and innovative culture. Our “Heritage plus Innovation” strategy enables us to combine proven performance with new, innovative capabilities to provide our customers with the building blocks for the present and future of space infrastructure.
Our mission is to accelerate humanity’s expansion into space by delivering reliable, economical and sustainable infrastructure for future generations. We offer a broad array of foundational products and services, many of which have been enabling space missions since the 1960s and have been flight-proven on over 160 satellite missions, including high-priority missions and constellations such as the GPS constellation, the International Space Station (ISS) and Mars Perseverance. We are a leading provider of innovative technologies with the potential to help transform the economics of space and create new markets for its exploration, commercialization and security. One example of this is our patented suite of in-space manufacturing and robotic assembly technologies (referred to herein as on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing, or “OSAM”), which is revolutionizing the approximately $23 billion satellite manufacturing market in the same way that reusable launch vehicles revolutionized the approximately $10 billion launch market, per Research and Markets and Allied Market Research, respectively. Other examples of our proprietary technologies include deployable structures, roll out solar array (ROSA) systems, human-rated camera systems and advanced payload adapters. Of particular note, our ROSA arrays are being installed on the ISS to efficiently augment its power generation capabilities as the ISS enters its next decade of operations. ROSA systems are experiencing significant market adoption, being utilized not only on the ISS but also launching on NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test mission. Other ROSA systems are being developed or delivered for the OVZON-3 telecommunications satellite, the Power and Propulsion Element for the NASA Lunar Gateway, and other programs. Many Redwire products and services are experiencing similar adoption.
We are a pure-play space infrastructure company with mission solutions for civil, commercial and national security space customers. We have grown organically as well as through several acquisitions from a fragmented landscape of space-focused technology companies. Our proven track record of successful growth through mergers and acquisitions is a major differentiator in our market. 
We believe the space economy is at an inflection point. The reduction of launch costs by approximately 95% over the last decade has eliminated the single largest economic barrier to entry for the expanded utilization of space, and the increasing cadence of launches provides more flexible, reliable access. This lower cost access has resulted in both the expansion and modernization of traditional national security and civil uses of space and has enticed new commercial entrants to invest substantial capital to develop new space-based business models. Our goal is to provide a full suite of infrastructure solutions, including mission-critical components, services and systems that will contribute to a dramatic expansion of the space-based economy. We believe that our products and services are

the foundational building blocks essential to the growth of the space civil, commercial and national security ecosystem now and into the future.
History
Redwire was formed to fill a void in the middle market for a pure play, public space infrastructure company with scale. We are achieving this goal by combining proven space technology providers with next generation space disruptors into a single, integrated platform. The Company, in its current form, was founded in 2020 by private equity firm AE Industrial Partners Fund II, LP (“AEI”), but the heritage of the various businesses that were brought together to form Redwire stretch back decades.
AEI formed a series of acquisition vehicles on February 10, 2020, which included Cosmos Parent, LLC, Cosmos Intermediate, LLC (“Cosmos” or the “Successor”), Cosmos Finance, LLC and Cosmos Acquisition, LLC, with Cosmos Parent, LLC being the top holding company. Upon the formation of these acquisition vehicles, Cosmos effected a number of acquisitions through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosmos Acquisition, LLC. Following the acquisitions, the Successor is a wholly owned subsidiary of AE Red Holdings, LLC formerly known as Redwire, LLC (“Holdings”).
The Company has grown organically while also continuing to integrate several acquisitions from a fragmented landscape of space-focused technology companies with innovative capabilities and deep flight heritage. Strategic acquisitions that augment our technology and product offerings are a key part of our growth strategy. We have completed eight acquisitions since March 2020, which collectively have provided us with a wide variety of complementary technologies and solutions to serve our target markets and customers.

On September 2, 2021, the previously announced merger (the “Merger”) with Genesis Park Acquisition Corp. (“GPAC”) was consummated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) dated March 25, 2021 by and among GPAC, Shepard Merger Sub Corporation (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of GPAC, Cosmos Intermediate, LLC and AE Red Holdings, LLC. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties completed a business combination transaction by which, (i) GPAC domesticated as a Delaware corporation in accordance with Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands (the “Domestication”), (ii) Merger Sub merged with and into Cosmos, with Cosmos being the surviving entity in the merger (the “First Merger”), and (iii) immediately following the First Merger, Cosmos merged with and into GPAC, with GPAC being the surviving entity in the merger (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers” or the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to the Domestication and the Transactions, collectively, as the “Merger”.
Upon the closing of the Merger, GPAC was renamed to Redwire Corporation. The Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in which GPAC is treated as the acquired company. A reverse recapitalization does not result in a new basis of accounting, and the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company in many respects. The Company was deemed the accounting predecessor and the combined entity is the successor SEC registrant, Redwire.
From time to time, the Company will acquire or dispose of businesses and realign contracts, programs or businesses among and within our organization. These realignments are typically designed to leverage existing capabilities more fully and to enhance efficient development and delivery of products and services. As of December 31, 2021, the Company operated in one operating segment and one reportable segment: space infrastructure. Refer to Note B of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this conclusion.
Business Strategy
With decades of flight heritage combined with the agile and innovative culture of a commercial space platform, we are uniquely positioned to assist our customers in solving the complex challenges of future space missions. Redwire is providing core technologies that form the foundational building blocks for the future of space infrastructure. Our technology innovation is centered on the following key strategic focus areas: 
On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly & Manufacturing
We anticipate that one of the most dramatic disruptions in the space industry will come from on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing (“OSAM”) of satellites and other spacecraft. The ability to manufacture in space significantly expands a satellite’s capabilities and reduces costs relative to the conventional method of manufacturing and assembling prior to launch. Space infrastructure such as satellite assets manufactured on Earth are designed to survive the acoustic vibrations and acceleration forces that accompany launch and are inherently limited by these design requirements. Space infrastructure manufactured in space may be optimized for the operational environment in orbit and are never exposed to launch conditions. Design optimization for in-space operation allows for improved performance, such as increased power generation via larger solar arrays or higher gain via large-scale antennas than those that can be economically deployed using conventional manufacturing methods.
By mitigating spacecraft volume limitations imposed by launch vehicles, manufacturing in space can also help to significantly reduce the costs of launch. Launch costs depend in part on the mass and volume of the spacecraft. The manufacturing and assembly of large spacecraft structures in orbit reduces spacecraft volume at launch, resulting in decreased launch costs and increased flexibility in launch provider selection, including utilization of smaller launch providers and rideshare programs.
Current OSAM applications include government-funded programs to enable increased small satellite power generation via large deployable solar arrays attached to booms that are 3D printed on-orbit. Commercial adoption of this technology could be a significant catalyst for growth in the overall space economy, enabling users to put more capability on orbit than state of the art approaches. We believe that OSAM represents a technological sea change that has the potential to upend traditional space operations. With sustainable in-space solutions, we believe OSAM will enable the next generation of growth in the space industry. Redwire’s additive manufacturing intellectual property that is critical to our OSAM solution has been proven in operation on the ISS since 2014 and is protected by our numerous patents.

Additionally, Redwire is developing a robotic arm for space applications. This scalable robotic arm system is expected to meet growing demand for space-capable robotic solutions in mission profiles ranging from lunar surface activities to on-orbit satellite servicing and beyond.
Advanced Sensors & Components
Our technology has been at the forefront of space exploration for decades, providing satellite components that are integral to the mission success of hundreds of low Earth orbit (“LEO”), geosynchronous (“GEO”) and interplanetary spacecraft. These are foundational components that are critical to almost every spacecraft deployment. We are combining our new and innovative space technologies with our proven spaceflight heritage to meet the complexity and demands of today’s growing and evolving space industry. Our sensor and component capabilities include the design and manufacture of mission-critical, high reliability technologies serving a wide variety of functions on the spacecraft. Our offerings include:
Solar Arrays: We offer a variety of solar array solutions for spacecraft spanning the entire spectrum of satellite size, power needs, and orbital location. We possess proprietary technologies, technical knowhow, and the facilities to design, build, and deliver competitive power generation solutions tailored to customer need. Of particular note, our patented and award-winning ROSA (Roll-Out Solar Array) technology features an innovative “roll-out” design which uses composite booms to serve as both the primary structural elements and the deployment actuator, and a modular photovoltaic blanket assembly that can be configured into a variety of solar array architectures. When configured for launch, ROSA stows into a compact cylindrical volume yielding efficient space utilization. The unique ROSA stowed configuration allows extremely large solar arrays to be stowed compactly within launch vehicles.
Composite Booms: We develop cost-effective, furlable composite boom products that deploy antennas and instruments from small satellites. We develop very long lightweight composite booms for applications including solar sails, dipole antennas and deployable tethers. The efficient packaging scheme of our Triangular Rollable and Collapsible (“TRAC”) Boom enables our customers to deploy extremely large systems from very small volumes.
RF Antennas: We are a supplier of high strain composite (“HSC”) antennas that have much simpler mechanical designs than larger, conventional satellite antennas. HSC structural elements can provide deployment actuation, damping, deployed stiffness and integrated electrical / RF functionality in one multifunctional part, enabling a variety of antenna architectures and structural designs.
Payload Adapters: We are a supplier of integrated structural systems that support multiple satellites of different sizes across multiple launch vehicle platforms. Our payload interface solutions are tailored to launch vehicle/payload requirements to achieve optimal performance, and efficient allocation of mass to support on-orbit function rather than launch vehicle interfaces.
Space-Qualified Camera Systems: We supply customers with low size, weight and power, flight-proven cameras for a variety of use cases. Our camera solutions are used for vehicle docking and near- and far-field cameras are used for space situational awareness and satellite navigation.
Star Trackers and Sun Sensors: Our star tracker solution provides superior guidance, navigation and control as it takes an image of the stars, measures its apparent position in the reference frame of the spacecraft and identifies the stars so its position can be compared with its known absolute position from a star catalog.
Over 1,000 of our sun sensors have been deployed on hundreds of spacecraft since the 1960s and we remain a leader in attitude control, solar array pointing, gyro updating and fail-safe recovery solutions.
Space Domain Awareness & Resiliency
The U.S. national security community is increasingly viewing space as a warfighting domain, as evidenced by significant space-based military infrastructure investment such as the National Defense Space Architecture (“NDSA”) and the creation of the U.S. Space Force. Advances in potentially adversarial capabilities in space have highlighted the need to improve both the physical and cyber resiliency of U.S. and allied space assets, as well as monitoring of all assets, friendly and potentially hostile, on orbit. In our Space Domain Awareness and Resiliency (“SDA&R”) strategic focus area, our core competencies and products support the national security community’s space resiliency and situational awareness missions.
Our key offerings in this area include sensor systems for on-orbit monitoring, advanced modeling & simulation, cyber resiliency, asset hardening, robotics, and full satellite solutions leveraging our OSAM capabilities. Our SDA&R portfolio contains a variety of optical instruments that perform situational awareness functions and can be adapted to act as space situational awareness cameras as a primary or secondary payload.

Digitally-Engineered Spacecraft
Digitally-engineered spacecraft are systems that are designed, developed and manufactured on a digital foundation. Model-based engineering and high fidelity digital engineering tools reduce assembly hours by utilizing an end-to-end virtual environment that is capable of producing a near perfect virtual replica of a physical space system, before a physical instance is created. This capability significantly reduces the cost and schedule required to design, develop and deploy spacecraft while also reducing the risk of deployment and the cost of operations and maintenance. Additionally, “digital twins” of individual components, spacecraft and constellations are used to improve cyber resiliency, health and monitoring, operations and maintenance of deployed space assets. 
We believe that the DoD and U.S. Space Force have embraced digital engineering as a foundational technology for the rapid, cost-effective development of their future space architectures. Digital engineering enables the modeling and simulation of future space architectures to provide high fidelity trade analysis, operational concepts and testing. Cyber resiliency is an increasing challenge for deployed space assets. This capability is critical to ensuring future civil, commercial and national security space assets are protected from cyber-based attacks.
Redwire has a proprietary enterprise software suite that enables advanced digital engineering and generation of high fidelity, interactive modeling and simulations of individual components, entire spacecraft and full constellations in a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) business model.
Low-Earth Orbit Commercialization
Our LEO commercialization strategic focus area is developing next-generation capabilities with a goal of developing efficient, commercial services for the ISS and other current and future human spaceflight programs. This focus area includes in-space additive manufacturing, space-based biotechnology applications, space plant and animal science, in-space advanced material manufacturing and support of human exploration, habitation and commercial activities in space.
We created the first permanent commercial manufacturing platform to operate in LEO, the Additive Manufacturing Facility (“AMF”). AMF was developed based on a desire for on-demand local manufacturing that is expected to become a mainstay for mission planning to address critical needs in space. This technology increases the reliability of long-duration missions and makes human spaceflight missions safer by providing crews with additional flexibility in responding to situations that may threaten a mission. The ability for tools to be manufactured on-site, on-demand, allows mission planners to reduce the amount of specialized equipment that must be included during launch, providing maximum flexibility and contingency while reducing costs. Beginning with a small ratchet created on the International Space Station, we have now manufactured 200+ parts in-space over the past six years and are the only company currently providing commercial 3D printing on the ISS.
Additionally, our in-space manufacturing capabilities and space biotechnology solutions provide the building blocks for a robust commercial space economy building products and solutions for use on Earth. Production of advanced industrial materials and biological materials in microgravity offer performance advantages over comparable products manufactured on Earth. The microgravity environment enables certain space-based products to be created with properties superior to their terrestrial analogue. By identifying advanced manufacturing processes, product development and biotechnology research and development which can leverage the microgravity environment to manufacture high performance materials and groundbreaking biomedical solutions that meet specific industrial and commercial use cases, we believe our approach to space commercialization advances the creation of a space-Earth value chain to spur economic development. We have demonstrated the ability to 3D print biological materials, to manufacture advanced ceramics, fiber optics, crystals and other industrial materials in microgravity.
Products and Solutions
Antennas
Our antenna systems enable space-to-space and space-to-Earth communications. Some form of communications antenna is required for nearly all satellites that are put into orbit. We offer a wide variety of antennas to meet a range of satellite mission requirements. Our Link-16 antenna can be used to facilitate the exchange of tactical imagery from space in near-real time between military aircraft, ships and ground forces. Our antennas also enable the exchange of encrypted messages, imagery data and multiple channels of digital voice communication. We believe this will enable reliable and efficient space-based tactical communications in environments in which it has historically been difficult to conduct communications-intensive operations.
Space-Qualified Sensors
We have a deep heritage in manufacturing space-qualified sensors. Every satellite that goes into orbit requires at least one star tracker, sun sensor and avionics package and we have developed advanced capabilities in these critical subsectors of the space supply chain. We also provide narrow and wide-field-of-view camera systems, in addition to camera systems that are rated for human space flight, to our customers across civil, national security and commercial space.
Page 7


Structures & Deployables
We provide a variety of deployable space structure offerings to help meet our customers’ mission requirements. We believe that our instrument booms are instrumental to the DoD’s goal of achieving space domain awareness. Our composite instrument booms can allow small satellites (“Smallsats”) to deploy high-power solar arrays, large antennas for high data rate communications and large drag augmentation devices for rapid end-of-life deorbiting. We have provided our ROSA technology to NASA to upgrade the International Space Station’s solar arrays since 2021. We have also developed rigid solar panels that we expect PlanetIQ to use for its HD GPS-RO weather satellite constellation. We also develop cost- effective composite booms that deploy antennas and instruments from small satellites, enabling a new generation of satellite constellations to provide science measurements and communications from space.
Space-enabled Manufacturing Payloads
Space-enabled manufacturing is a form of in-space manufacturing that leverages microgravity to produce materials with superior performance and broader applications when compared to comparable terrestrial materials. We have a suite of space-enabled manufacturing payloads configured for installation and operation aboard the ISS for demonstrating a variety of advanced manufacturing techniques and facilities with broad applications. We offer payloads capable of additive manufacturing, optical fiber manufacturing, ceramic turbine blisk manufacturing, industrial crystal manufacturing, hybrid metal / polymer manufacturing and more. These techniques may one day have the potential to transform the LEO commercial environment by providing solutions in space for space and in space for Earth.
Space-enabled Biotechnology Payloads
Redwire develops advanced space biotechnology payloads for the purpose of pharmaceutical and medical research and development and human space flight operations and sustainment. For example, the 3D BioFabrication Facility (BFF) and the ADvanced Space Experiment Processor (ADSEP), together comprise the first-ever system capable of manufacturing human tissue in the microgravity condition of space. Utilizing adult human cells (such as pluripotent or stem cells), the system can create viable tissue in space through technology that enables it to precisely place and build ultra-fine layers of bioink – layers that may be several times smaller than the width of a human hair – involving the smallest print tips in existence. Additionally, we have developed critical biotechnology payloads for the research of musculoskeletal disease, osteoarthritis, regenerative medicine, and space plant/food production. 
Cloud-enabled Digital Engineering Enterprise Software Platform
Redwire sells a proprietary enterprise software suite that enables advanced digital engineering and generation of high fidelity, interactive modeling and simulations of individual components, entire spacecraft and full constellations in a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. This software suite supports spacecraft and constellation developers in the design, development, deployment, management, maintenance and cyber protection of their space assets.
Engineering, Support Services, Testing and Operation Solutions
We are a one-stop-shop for mechanism design and manufacturing, power supply design and analysis, project planning and management, control processes, structural and thermal analysis, and system engineering solutions for space-based products and applications. We provide our engineering services at any stage of the design process for our customers, whether it be final testing or initial project schematics. This service offering allows us to introduce customers to our capabilities and demonstrate our ability to help optimize and enable the success of their missions. 
Backlog
We view growth in backlog as a key measure of our business growth. As of December 31, 2021, our total backlog was $271.6 million, which includes contracted and uncontracted backlog of $139.7 million and $131.9 million, respectively. Contracted backlog represents the estimated dollar value of firm funded executed contracts for which work has not been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract). Uncontracted backlog represents the anticipated contract value, or portion thereof, of goods and services to be delivered under existing contracts which have not been appropriated or otherwise authorized. For further information, refer to “Backlog” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”).
Seasonality
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenue between accounting periods, including the timing of contract awards and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Customers and Strategic Partnerships / Relationships
Our product and solution offerings are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of public and private entities operating in space. We have formalized contracts and strategic partnerships with numerous customers, and we plan to continue pursuing additional agreements and partnerships.
Page 8


Civil Space Community Relationships
Civilian space agencies currently make up the largest portion of our current revenue base. Projects for these customers are typically meant to gather data for the public’s use, advance research objectives, further the exploration and utilization of space, and/or develop new scientific and commercial applications and uses of the space domain. Contracts are primarily fielded by governmental entities that are not funded by defense budgets. Many of these contracts will have a research and demonstration phase which may later convert to full-scale production contracts or commercial opportunities.
NASA
NASA is one of our largest and most long-standing customers. We participate in numerous large, high-profile contracts, our largest by revenue currently being the Archinaut One program, also known as OSAM-2. Our Archinaut One program includes the design, manufacture, test, integration and operation of the first satellite to construct a portion of its own structure on-orbit. The Archinaut One satellite combines our additive manufacturing and robotic assembly capabilities for the construction of large, complex structures in space. We have provided services and products supporting a number of other NASA missions, including sun sensors and star trackers for exploration missions like Perseverance, thermal control solutions for technology demonstrators, camera systems for upcoming human spaceflight missions, and development of various additive manufacturing methods on the ISS.
Luxembourg Space Agency and European Space Agency
We are working with the Luxembourg Space Agency and the European Space Agency to develop a robotic arm for space applications. This scalable robotic arm system is expected to meet growing demand for space-capable robotic solutions in mission profiles ranging from lunar surface activities to on-orbit satellite servicing and beyond.
National Security Community Relationships
We supply a wide variety of technologies and solutions supporting the U.S. and allied countries’ national security objectives in space. As space becomes an increasingly contested domain and near peer threats continue to emerge, the DoD has articulated a need for significant investment in both improving the resiliency of existing space assets and the deployment of new, next-generation capabilities.
Commercial Community Relationships
Through our numerous strategic partnerships with large and high-profile commercial customers, we believe that our technologies are enabling the commercialization of LEO and potentially beyond. We view the commercial market opportunity as one with significant growth possibilities as launch costs continue to decrease, making industrial and other commercial pursuits increasingly viable and prolific.
Customer Concentration
The majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from government contracts. Refer to Note S of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on sales by major customers and location. 
Space Economy Overview
Prior to the 1990’s, access to the global space industry was largely limited to federal governments and a few select telecommunications providers, providing little incentive to lower launch costs or innovate. Over the past three decades, the advent of lower-cost launch technology has driven a paradigm shift and democratized access to space. This has created a vibrant commercial landscape that is driving innovation across major terrestrial industries on Earth. The entrepreneurial energy dedicated to space is disrupting industries including telecommunications, internet infrastructure, weather, aviation, agriculture, advanced materials science, insurance and Earth observation. The military and scientific communities have continued to pursue and fund technological advancement, bolstering a myriad of technologies that have both national security and commercial applications.
We believe that the space industry is at the dawn of a new economic era driven by significant investment. In addition to government contracting, private capital entering the space market has accelerated its growth. Over the last 10 years, there has been approximately $253 billion of equity investment across 1,694 space companies per Space Capital (2021 Q4 Analysis). This has led to a wave of new companies reimagining parts of the traditional space industry.
Today’s space market is primarily driven by satellite technologies and applications but is quickly expanding to include tangential capabilities such as space tourism, in-space manufacturing, LEO commercialization, deep space exploration and space-based resource extraction. The global space economy generated approximately $420 billion of total revenue in 2019 and is expected to grow to an 
Page 9


estimated $2 trillion by 2040, per the Space Report (2020 Q2 Analysis). The rapid deployment of satellite constellations coinciding with an increasingly competitive landscape in the launch industry is creating unprecedented access to space.
Government agencies have realized the value of the private commercial space industry and have become increasingly supportive and reliant on private companies to catalyze innovation and advance national space objectives. In the U.S., this has been evidenced by notable policy initiatives and commercial contractors’ growing share of federally funded space activity.
Launch Costs and Small Satellite Proliferation
The emergence of large reusable rockets, such as the SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Blue Origin’s upcoming New Glenn rocket, has brought launch costs down by as much as approximately 95% over the past decade according to a July 2018 report by NASA. Additionally, small launch providers have been actively pursuing the market for delivering smaller satellites into LEO. The competition among launch providers is creating a unique opportunity for new space entrants to grow quickly and take advantage of the fact that the per-kilogram cost of launching satellites to LEO is as low as approximately $2,700/kg. Improving launch economics have driven an increase in assets sent to orbit, with both commercial providers and governments participating.
The satellite market has gone through a paradigm shift over the past 10 years, with larger numbers of Smallsats, defined as any satellite under 600 kg, replacing large, exquisite satellites that have traditionally been placed into geosynchronous Earth orbit, or GEO. Smallsat adoption has increased as satellite technology has miniaturized. In LEO, more capability can be offered without the need for redundancy and radiation tolerance that is expected for the harsher GEO environment. The annual number of Smallsats launched has increased almost eightfold since 2012. In 2021, 94% of all launches included a smallsat, up from 24% in 2012, per Bryce Space and Technology. We anticipate continued growth in the satellite constellation market given the relatively short lifespan, need for larger constellations to provide global coverage and continued technological advancements.
In the U.S., the Space Development Agency is planning to launch thousands of small satellites in support of the National Defense Space Architecture. The advent of the Space Force and interest in Smallsats from the intelligence community has established the DoD as a significant stakeholder in the space economy as space becomes a contested domain. Missile defense capabilities and hardened, low-latency military communications networks are critical for the U.S. to counter aggression from near-peer threats. Additionally, hundreds of commercial providers of internet broadband, imagery and other value-added services have applied to launch over 50,000 small satellites in the next decade as they seek to secure market share in the new space economy. This compares to just 6,000 satellites in orbit as of April 2020.
LEO Commercialization & On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing
A major growth opportunity for the global space economy is the increased commercialization of LEO. Increased accessibility to space has given rise to a growing number of start-up technology companies that aim to serve diverse end-markets including energy, telecommunications, tourism and Internet-of-things connectivity. There are increasingly attractive economics for manufacturing advanced materials in space for industrial use on Earth, including ZBLAN optical fiber and advanced ceramic materials. Ceramic parts manufactured in microgravity have a myriad of applications on Earth, including components for turbines and nuclear plants. Other fast currents in LEO include space tourism and sustainable human space habitats. The International Space Station has served as a breeding ground for the commercialization of space and many well-funded operators have announced a vision to enable millions of humans visiting and living in space.
We anticipate that the most dramatic disruption in the space industry will come from capabilities surrounding on-orbit servicing, assembly and manufacturing of spacecraft. With sustainable in-space solutions, we believe OSAM will be instrumental in enabling the next generation of growth in the space industry.
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances and generally encounter intense competition to win contracts from many other firms, including lower and mid-tier federal contractors with specialized capabilities, large defense contractors and the federal government. Some of our competitors in each of our markets are larger than we are and can maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. In each of our markets, we concentrate on the opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors in these markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities, including reliable, resilient and innovative space infrastructure technologies; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost-effectiveness. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.
We frequently “partner” or are involved in subcontracting and teaming relationships with companies that are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. We compete domestically and internationally against (i) non-traditional aerospace and defense contractors, principally Blue Canyon Technologies, Inc. (a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies), York Space Systems and Tyvak 
Page 10


Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc., Space Micro Inc., Amergient Technologies, Sodern, and (ii) occasionally large aerospace and defense companies, principally, Northrop Grumman Corporation, L3Harris, Moog, Ball Aerospace, and Maxar Technologies. Our defense prime contractor customers could decide to pursue one or more of our product development areas as a core competency and insource that technology development and production rather than purchase that capability from us as a supplier. This competition could result in fewer customer orders and a loss of market share.
In addition, some of our foreign competitors currently benefit from, and others may benefit in the future from, protective measures by their home countries where governments are providing financial support, including significant investments in the development of new technologies. Government support of this nature greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with aerospace technology development activities for these competitors. This market environment may result in increased pressures on our pricing and other competitive factors.
Resources
Research and Development
Our research and product development programs are intended to advance the future of space infrastructure. We have both internally and externally funded research and development projects. Our business strategy is dependent on technological advancements that support our existing and future products and solutions. Our focus for research and development aligns with our strategic focus areas outlined above with particular emphasis on areas of significant growth and long-term opportunity. Looking forward, we expect to continue our investment in fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability.
We conduct research and development principally in the United States and Luxembourg. Research and development expenses were $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Intellectual Property
We own a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as many U.S. trademarks, domain names and copyrights. We actively pursue internal development of intellectual property. In addition to our patent portfolio, we own other intellectual property such as unpatented trade secrets, know-how, data and software. Additionally, we rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business operations, including certain proprietary rights licensed to and from third parties. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss, expiration or termination would have a material effect on our business.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We are generally engaged in light manufacturing activities and have limited exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. When we manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as a base of third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials; occasionally, we have experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing process.
Regulatory
Federal Communications Commission
The regulations, policies and guidance issued by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) apply to the operation of our spacecraft. When we communicate with our spacecraft using any part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we are operating a space station to which FCC regulations apply. Operators of regulated space stations are required to hold and maintain compliance with proper licenses throughout the duration of any given mission. We are currently preparing an FCC license application in connection with the Archinaut One program.
The FCC recently enacted a new set of licensing guidelines for small satellites and related systems that may apply to future spacecraft. As a result, we may face a transition to the small satellite licensing guidelines. Additionally, the FCC is currently considering additional rules which could change the operational, technical and financial requirements for commercial space operators subject to U.S. jurisdiction. If these, proposed rules become final, they could change system design and financial costs in order to comply with or secure new Redwire spectrum licensure.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Redwire spacecraft will operate with space-qualified photographic equipment installed. While primarily intended to function as mission assurance tools, these cameras may be capable of capturing incidental Earth imagery while in orbit. As such, these cameras may be subject to the licensing requirements and regulations of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association’s (“NOAA") Commercial Report Sensing Regulatory Affairs (“CRSRA”) office. We are currently assessing the applicability of NOAA’s licensing requirements and exclusions in connection with the Archinaut One program.
The Federal Aviation Administration
As a participant in launch activities, we are indirectly subject to the license requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (“AST”). The FAA regulates the airspace of the United States, through which launch vehicles must fly during launch to orbit. The AST office predominantly processes launch license requests submitted by launch vehicle operators, which include information on the constituent payloads flying on any given mission. As a result, reviews of our payloads by AST will occur during, for example, the processing of a launch vehicle provider launch license.
International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Controls
Our orbital infrastructure business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.
Human Capital
We are committed to technical excellence and mission success which is reinforced by our core values:
•Integrity: We stand for honesty, fairness, and commitment in all that we do, and an uncompromising adherence to ethical behavior.
•Innovation: We are change agents. We find new ways to solve our customers’ most challenging problems. Our thought leadership will create new opportunities for better ways to accomplish our goals.
•Impact: We will have a positive impact on our industry, community, nation and humanity. We focus on solving important problems that will shape future outcomes in a positive way.
•Inclusion: We believe in the value of diverse perspectives. Individuals from all backgrounds, experiences and skill sets are needed to make Redwire successful. We value each other.
•Excellence: We are focused professionals who are committed to delivering results.
We strive to be the employer of choice in the space community. As of December 31, 2021, we had 606 employees, all of whom are based in the United States and Luxembourg. 
We have established and experienced human resources team that is leading this effort. Most of our employees fall into one or more of the following categories: (a) graduates from well-regarded engineering universities with a desire to make a long-term impact, (b) experienced engineers from other aerospace companies who are excited about the ongoing innovation and industry transformations that we believe we are driving, and (c) founders and employees from companies we have acquired. Many of these employees are highly accomplished in their fields and earned advanced degrees in concentrations such as aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, physics, chemistry, robotics and astronomy.
Recruitment
Based on existing programs, we are planning to increase the size of our workforce by approximately one third to support already contracted work. We have established an experienced talent acquisition team and anticipate that we will be able to achieve this goal based on our past record. Our recruitment efforts have been successful over the past year leading to approximately 34% of our current employees having been hired in the previous twelve months.
As we continue to grow, we are increasing our recruiting capacity by expanding our talent acquisition team of professionals and enhancing internal incentives for recruitment. In addition, we are continuing to develop our compensation and benefits programs to compete for talent in a tight labor market. One particular recruitment advantage the Company has is the ability to offer equity participation through the Redwire Corporation 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan. This program encourages the “founder mentality” we hope all of our employees maintain.

Diversity and Inclusion
Redwire is committed to recruiting, retaining and promoting a diverse workforce. We support several organizations supporting diversity in the aerospace field, such as: the Brooke Owens Fellowship, the Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship, and the ZED Factor Fellowship program. At Redwire, Inclusion is a core value. We are implementing programs that celebrate the diversity of our workforce and highlight the contributions of under-represented communities. Through our leadership communications, community sponsorships and policy development, we are committed to a culture that promotes diversity and inclusion throughout the company and our industry.
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to offer competitive salaries and benefits. Management monitors the changing labor conditions at a national and local level and adjusts compensation packages in order to attract and retain high performing individuals. The Company offers short- and long-term incentive programs, a defined contribution plan, healthcare benefits, flexible paid time off as well as employee assistance programs. The Company’s incentives programs are intended to motivate and reward strong performance.
Support for Our Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic
The Company has been actively engaged in promoting the health and welfare of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. A COVID-19 task force was created and met regularly to implement COVID-19 health protocols in compliance with federal, state and local recommendations. During the height of the pandemic, employees were permitted to work remotely when possible. Management also implemented changes to physical office layouts and work schedules as well as encouraged masking, vaccination and social distancing to ensure our employees remained protected from illness. Management continues to monitor cases of exposure and contagion on a weekly basis to respond quickly to COVID-19 incidents as they occur.
