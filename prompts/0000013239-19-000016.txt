ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
Overview
Hexion Inc. (“Hexion” or the “Company”), a New Jersey corporation with predecessors dating from 1899, is one of the world’s largest producers of thermosetting resins, or thermosets, and a leading producer of adhesive and structural resins and coatings. Thermosets are a critical ingredient in most paints, coatings, glues and other adhesives produced for consumer or industrial uses. The type of thermoset used, and how it is formulated, applied and cured, determines its key attributes, such as durability, gloss, heat resistance, adhesion or strength of the final product. Thermosetting resins include materials such as phenolic resins, epoxy resins, polyester resins, acrylic resins and urethane resins.
Our direct parent is Hexion LLC, a holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of Hexion Holdings LLC (“Hexion Holdings”), the ultimate parent entity of Hexion. Hexion Holdings is controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (together with Apollo Global Management, LLC and its subsidiaries, “Apollo”). 
 Our business is organized based on the products we offer and the markets we serve. At December 31, 2018, we had three reportable segments: Epoxy, Phenolic and Coating Resins; Forest Products Resins; and Corporate and Other.
Bankruptcy Filing
On April 1, 2019, the Company, Hexion Holdings LLC, Hexion LLC and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code” or “Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings are being jointly administered under the caption In re Hexion Holdings LLC, No. 19-10684 (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). The Debtors will continue to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Petitions constitute an event of default that accelerated our obligations under our senior secured asset-based revolving loan facility (the “ABL Facility”) and 6.625% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 10.00% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 10.375% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 13.75% Senior Secured Notes, 9.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 9.2% debentures and 7.875% debentures (collectively, the “Notes”). 

 3

In connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”) with equityholders that beneficially own more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding equity (the “Consenting Sponsors”) and creditors holding more than two-thirds of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each tranche of our Notes (the “Consenting Creditors” and, together with the Consenting Sponsors, the “Consenting Parties”). The Support Agreement incorporates economic terms regarding a restructuring of the Debtors agreed to by the parties reflected in a term sheet attached as Exhibit A to the Support Agreement. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Consenting Parties and the Debtors made certain customary commitments to each other, including the Consenting Parties committing to support and vote for restructuring transactions to be effectuated through a plan of reorganization that incorporates the economic terms included in the Support Agreement (the “Plan”) to be proposed by the Debtors. 
Also in connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, Hexion LLC, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into an agreement with certain lenders providing for a $350 senior secured asset-based revolving term loan facility (the “DIP ABL Facility”), and Hexion LLC, the Company and Hexion International Holdings B.V., a wholly owned Dutch subsidiary of the Company (the “Dutch Borrower”), entered into an agreement providing for a $350 senior secured term loan (the “DIP Term Loan Facility” and, together with the DIP ABL Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The Company received interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court to access $600 of the $700 permitted under the Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the DIP Term Loan Facility were used by the Dutch Borrower to make an intercompany loan to the Company, which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries used to repay amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility to and for general corporate purposes. Availability under the DIP ABL Facility will be used to support outstanding letters of credit and ongoing working capital requirements. 
Going Concern
We have concluded our financial condition and our projected operating results, the defaults under our debt agreements, and the risks and uncertainties surrounding our Chapter 11 proceedings raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
We have $1.9 billion of First Priority Senior Secured Notes maturing in April 2020. If 91 days prior to the scheduled maturity of these notes, more than $50 aggregate principal amount is outstanding, the ABL Facility would have accelerated and become immediately due and payable. Additionally, we have $0.6 billion of Second Priority Notes maturing in November 2020. Based on our current liquidity position, the acceleration of the ABL Facility and our Chapter 11 Cases, our current projections of operating results, cash flows and liquidity over the next twelve months are not expected to be sufficient to fund our most significant cash obligations necessary to continue as a going concern. 
Products and Markets
We have a broad range of thermoset resin technologies, with high quality research, applications development and technical service capabilities. We provide a broad array of thermosets and associated technologies, and have significant market positions in each of the key markets that we serve.
Our products are used in thousands of applications and are sold into diverse markets, such as forest products, architectural and industrial paints, packaging, consumer products, composites and automotive coatings. Major industry sectors that we serve include industrial/marine, construction, consumer/durable goods, automotive, wind energy, aviation, electronics, architectural, civil engineering, repair/remodeling and oil and gas field support. The diversity of our products limits our dependence on any one market or end-use. We have a history of product innovation and success in introducing new products to new markets, as evidenced by more than 750 granted patents, the majority of which relate to the development of new products and manufacturing processes, and we are constantly looking at ways to introduce new products in our currently established markets.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 47 active production sites around the world. Through our worldwide network of strategically located production facilities, we serve more than 3,100 customers in approximately 85 countries. Our position in certain additives, complementary materials and services further enables us to leverage our core thermoset technologies and provide our customers with a broad range of product solutions. As a result of our focus on innovation and a high level of technical service, we have cultivated long-standing customer relationships. Our global customers include leading companies in their respective industries, such as 3M, Akzo Nobel, BASF, Bayer, Dow, Louisiana Pacific, Monsanto, Owens Corning, PPG Industries, Valspar and Weyerhaeuser.
Industry & Competitors
We are a large participant in the specialty chemicals industry. Thermosetting resins are generally considered specialty chemical products because they are sold primarily on the basis of performance, technical support, product innovation and customer service. However, as a result of the impact of the ongoing global economic uncertainty and overcapacity in certain markets, certain of our competitors have focused more on price to retain business and market share, which we have selectively followed in certain markets to maintain market share and remain a market leader.
We compete with many companies in most of our product lines, including large global chemical companies and small specialty chemical companies. No single company competes with us across all of our segments and existing product lines. The principal competitive factors in our industry include technical service, breadth of product offerings, product innovation, product quality and price. Some of our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and may be able to better withstand adverse changes in industry conditions, including pricing, and the economy as a whole. Further, our competitors may have more resources to support continued expansion than we do. Some of our competitors also have a greater range of products and may be more vertically integrated than we are within specific product lines or geographies.
 4

We believe that the principal factors that contribute to success in the specialty chemicals market, and our ability to maintain our position in the markets we serve, are (i) consistent delivery of high-quality products; (ii) favorable process economics; (iii) the ability to provide value to customers through both product attributes and strong technical service and (iv) an international footprint and presence in growing and developing markets.

Corporate and Other Segment
Our Corporate and Other segment primarily includes corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the other segments, such as shared service and administrative functions, foreign exchange gains and losses and legacy company costs.
For additional information about our segments, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marketing, Customers and Seasonality
Our products are sold to industrial users worldwide through a combination of a direct sales force that services our larger customers and third-party distributors that more cost-effectively serve our smaller customers. Our customer service and support network is made up of key regional customer service centers. We have global account teams that serve the major needs of our global customers for technical service and supply and commercial term requirements. Where operating and regulatory factors vary from country to country, these functions are managed locally.
In 2018, our largest customer accounted for approximately 2% of our net sales, and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 15% of our net sales. Neither our overall business nor any of our reporting segments depends on any single customer or a particular group of customers; therefore, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on either of our two reporting segments or the Company as a whole. Our primary customers are manufacturers, and the demand for our products is seasonal in certain of our businesses, with the highest demand in the summer months and lowest in the winter months. Therefore, the dollar amount of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2018 is not significant. Demand for our products can also be cyclical, as general economic health and industrial and commercial production levels are key drivers for our business. 
International Operations
Our non-U.S. operations accounted for 56%, 58% and 60% of our sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While our international operations may be subject to a number of additional risks, such as exposure to foreign currency exchange risk, we do not believe that our foreign operations, on the whole, carry significantly greater risk than our operations in the United States. Information about sales by geographic region for the past three years and long-lived assets by geographic region for the past two years can be found in Note 15 in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. More information about our methods and actions to manage exchange risk and interest rate risk can be found in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Raw Materials
In 2018, we purchased approximately $2.4 billion of raw materials, representing approximately 75% of our cost of sales. The three largest raw materials that we use are phenol, methanol and urea, which collectively represented approximately 50% of our total raw material expenditures in 2018. The majority of raw materials that we use to manufacture our products are available from more than one source, and are readily available in the open market. We have long-term purchase agreements for certain raw materials that ensure the availability of adequate supply. These agreements generally have periodic price adjustment mechanisms and do not have minimum annual purchase requirements. Smaller quantity materials that are single sourced generally have long-term supply contracts to maximize supply reliability. Prices for our main feedstocks are generally driven by underlying petrochemical benchmark prices and energy costs, which are subject to price fluctuations. Although we seek to offset increases in raw material prices with increases in our product prices, we may not always be able to do so, and there are periods when price increases lag behind raw material price increases.

 Research and Development
Our research and development activities are geared towards developing and enhancing products, processes and application technologies so that we can maintain our position as the world’s largest producer of thermosetting resins. We focus on:

• | developing new or improved applications based on our existing product lines and identified market trends;


• | developing new resin products and applications for customers to improve their competitive advantage and profitability;


• | providing premier technical service for customers of specialty products;


• | providing technical support for manufacturing locations and assisting in optimizing our manufacturing processes;


• | ensuring that our products are manufactured consistent with our global environmental, health and safety policies and objectives;


• | developing lower cost manufacturing processes globally; and


• | expanding our production capacity.

We have over 360 scientists and technicians worldwide. Our research and development facilities include a broad range of synthesis, testing and formulating equipment and small-scale versions of customer manufacturing processes for applications development and demonstration.
More recently, we have focused research and development resources on the incorporation of green chemistry principles into technology innovations to remain competitive and to address our customers’ demands for more environmentally preferred solutions. Our efforts have focused on developing resin technologies that reduce emissions, maximize efficiency and increase the use of bio-based raw materials. Some examples of meaningful results of our investment in the development of green products include:


• | EPIKOTE™ / EPIKURE™ epoxy systems for wind energy applications, which provide superior mechanical and process properties, reducing air emissions when hours of energy are created;


• | EPIKOTE™ and Bakelite® resin systems for automotive applications, which produce lightweight automotive composite components and other automotive parts that allow customers to build cars with better mileage, reducing air emissions without sacrificing performance;


• | EcoBind™ Resin Technology, an ultra low-emitting binder resin used to produce engineered wood products,


• | Epi-Rez™ Epoxy Waterborne Resins, which provide for lower volatile organic compounds, reducing air emissions; and 


• | VeoVa™ vinyl ester, a Versatics acid and derivatives product, which is an isocyanate-free resin. 

 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our research and development and technical services expense was $53, $58 and $59, respectively ($3 in 2016 related to divested businesses). We take a customer-driven approach to discovering new applications and processes and providing customer service through our technical staff. Through regular direct contact with our key customers, our research and development associates can become aware of evolving customer needs in advance, and can anticipate their requirements to more effectively plan customer programs. We also focus on continuous improvement of plant yields and production capacity and reduction of fixed costs.
Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2018, we own, license or have rights to over 750 granted patents and over 1,100 registered trademarks, as well as various patent and trademark applications and technology licenses around the world, which we currently use or hold for use in our operations. A majority of our patents relate to developing new products and processes for manufacturing and will expire between 2019 and 2036. We renew our trademarks on a regular basis. While we view our patents and trademarks to be valuable, because of the broad scope of our products and services, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or the continuation of our business.
Industry Regulatory Matters
Domestic and international laws regulate the production and marketing of chemical substances. Almost every country has its own legal procedures for registration and import. Of these, the laws and regulations in the European Union, the United States (Toxic Substances Control Act) and China are the most significant to our business. Additionally, other laws and regulations may also limit our expansion into other countries. Chemicals that are not included on one or more of these, or any other country’s chemical inventory lists, can usually be registered and imported, but may first require additional testing or submission of additional administrative information.
The European Commission enacted a regulatory system in 2006, known as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances (“REACH”), which requires manufacturers, importers and consumers of certain chemicals to register these chemicals and evaluate their potential impact on human health and the environment. As REACH matures, significant market restrictions could be imposed on the current and future uses of chemical products that we use as raw materials or that we sell as finished products in the European Union. Other countries may also enact similar regulations. 
 9

Environmental Regulations
Our policy is to operate our plants in a manner that protects the environment, health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We have implemented company-wide environmental, health and safety policies managed by our Environmental, Health and Safety (“EH&S”) department and overseen by the EH&S Committee of Hexion Holdings’ Board of Managers. Our EH&S department provides support and oversight to our operations worldwide to ensure compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. This responsibility is executed via training, communication of EH&S policies, formulation of relevant policies and standards, EH&S audits and incident response planning and implementation. Our EH&S policies include systems and procedures that govern environmental emissions, waste generation, process safety management, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, worker health and safety requirements, site security, emergency planning and response and product stewardship.
Our operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and we are subject to extensive environmental regulation at the federal, state and international levels. We are also exposed to the risk of claims for environmental remediation or restoration. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs. In addition, statutes such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state and foreign laws impose strict, joint and several liability for investigating and remediating the consequences of spills and other releases of hazardous materials, substances and wastes at current and former facilities, as well as third-party disposal sites. Other laws permit individuals to seek recovery of damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances and conditions at our facilities or to hazardous substances otherwise owned, sold or controlled by us. Therefore, notwithstanding our commitment to environmental management and environmental health and safety, we may incur liabilities in the future, and these liabilities may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Although our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with international, federal and state laws and environmental regulations, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, our former operations, including our ink, wallcoverings, film, phosphate mining and processing, thermoplastics and food and dairy operations, may give rise to claims relating to our period of ownership.
We expect to incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under environmental, health and safety laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair pollution control equipment. In 2018, we incurred related capital expenditures of $19. We estimate that capital expenditures in 2019 for environmental controls at our facilities will be between $25 and $30. This estimate is based on current regulations and other requirements, but it is possible that a material amount of capital expenditures, in addition to those we currently anticipate, could be necessary if these regulations or other requirements or other facts change.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 4,000 employees. Approximately 40% of our employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements, including most of our European employees. We believe that we have good relations with our union and non-union employees.
Our Board of Directors and sole shareholder expect honest and ethical conduct from every employee. We strive to adhere to the highest ethical standards in the conduct of our business and to comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to the business. Each employee has a responsibility to maintain and advance the ethical values of the Company. In support of this, our employees receive training to emphasize the importance of compliance with our Code of Conduct.
