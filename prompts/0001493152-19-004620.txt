We have focused our business activities on three primary business solutions: (i) Industrial Truck Management Solutions (“PowerFleet for Industrial”), (ii) Logistics Visibility (LV) Solutions (“PowerFleet for Logistics”) (formerly “Transportation Asset Management”), and (iii) Connected Vehicle Solutions (“PowerFleet for Automotive”). Our solutions for industrial truck management allow our customers to reduce operating risks and improve operating efficiency including monitoring for unsafe activity, identifying facility equipment and goods damage, lowering operational costs and capital expenditures and ensuring compliance with certain safety regulations by accurately and reliably measuring and controlling fleet activity. This solution also enhances security at industrial facilities and areas of critical infrastructure, such as airports, by controlling access to, and restricting the use of, vehicles and equipment. Our solutions for logistics visibility allow our customers to increase revenue per asset deployed, optimize fleet size, and improve the monitoring and control of sensitive cargo. Our solutions for connected vehicles include unique Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) projects similar to projects we have delivered to Avis Budget Group Inc. (“Avis”). These engineering programs help our customers transform their operations. For Avis, our rental fleet management platform assists in generating higher revenue by more accurately tracking vehicle data, such as fuel consumption and odometer readings, and improving customer service by expediting the rental and return processes. In addition, our wireless solution for “car sharing” enables rental car companies to establish a network of vehicles positioned strategically around cities or on corporate campuses, control vehicles remotely with secure lock and unlock capability, manage member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and charge members for vehicle use by the hour.
 
To provide an even deeper layer of insights into asset operations, we have developed a cloud-based software application called I.D. Systems Analytics (“Analytics”), which is designed to provide a single, integrated view of asset activity across multiple locations, that provides enterprise-wide benchmarks and peer-industry comparisons for key performance indicators (“KPIs”) relating to the performance of managed assets. Analytics enables values for the KPIs to be calculated and used to identify cost benefit measurements which translate the KPI values into monetized metrics. On top of our Analytics and software-as-a-service platforms, we launched “Lucy” a deep learning, voice integrated virtual assistant. We expect that our growing database of operational data from monitored assets and operational workflows coupled with Lucy’s contextual learnings will allow us to create industry benchmarks that can be used to tell our customers how they are performing compared to their peers. We look for Analytics, as well as the data contained therein, to make a growing contribution to revenue, further differentiate and add value to our solutions, and help keep us at the forefront of the wireless asset management markets we serve.
 
We sell our solutions to both executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. We also utilize channel partners such as independent dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may opt for us to white label our product. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer’s organization. We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments. Post-implementation, we consult with our customers to further extend and customize the benefits to the enterprise by delivering enhanced analytics capabilities.
 
We market and sell our solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, heavy industry, retail and wholesale distribution, transportation, aviation, aerospace and defense, homeland security and vehicle rental. Based on revenues for 2018, our top customers were Avis and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

Our Solutions
 
We design and implement wireless IoT and M2M asset management solutions that deliver both site-level and enterprise-level return on investment for our customers. Our solutions can be targeted to either campus-based assets or “over-the-road” assets.
Industrial Truck Management Solutions (“PowerFleet for Industrial”)
 
Our asset management solutions for campus-type and wide area-based assets incorporate wireless devices that provide on-board control, location tracking and data processing for enterprise assets, to provide real-time visibility of, and two-way communications with, such assets. These systems provide technological advantages that differentiate them from systems used for inventory, warehouse management and logistics tracking. For example, while inventory tracking systems rely on constant, continuous wireless connectivity to perform core functions, our systems require only periodic wireless communications and, our on-asset devices are designed to perform their core functions autonomously. Our enterprise-class software Analytics and Lucy can run in the cloud or behind our customer’s firewall.
 
Our campus-based asset management system consists of four principal elements:
 

● | miniature wireless programmable computers attached to assets; these wireless devices may communicate via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, via the company’s proprietary IRF protocol, or via cellular link; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | optional, IRF-based, fixed-position communication infrastructure consisting of network devices with two-way wireless communication capabilities and, optional IRF-based location-emitting beacons for enhanced indoor location calculation; 
● | application-specific middleware servers, which are typically hosted in our data center, but may also be hosted on the customers’ local area network (LAN) or enterprise wide area network (WAN); and 
● | proprietary end-user software, which is a user-friendly web application that provides visibility and control of the system database, and which is hosted at the same data center as the middleware. As stated above, our enterprise software is flexible enough to run thousands of customers, sites or assets in either a customer hosted or in the cloud configuration. 

 
Each of these system elements can process and store information independently to create a unique, patented system of “distributed intelligence,” which mitigates the risk that a single point of failure could compromise system integrity or data and asset security. Our on-asset hardware stores and processes information locally so that it can autonomously and automatically control the asset and monitor asset activity regardless of the status or availability of other system components. Our on-asset hardware performs its functions even when outside the wireless range of any other system component or if the middleware is unavailable.
 
Our optional IRF infrastructure devices also independently process data and execute programmable application logic, in addition to linking monitored mobile asset data automatically to our system’s middleware. The link to the system’s middleware may leverage secure cellular communication, thereby permitting remotely-hosted server software without access to local IT infrastructure.
 
Our cellular “Hotspot” option allows our products to be outfitted on assets that go beyond campus boundaries such as aviation and construction equipment.
 
Our middleware applications populate the system’s database and is designed to mitigate the effects of any computer outages that could affect real-time availability of the database.
 
Finally, our client software interfaces only with the database, not directly with our communication infrastructure or on-asset hardware, which restricts access to, and limits corruption of, system information and minimizes network bandwidth usage.

In addition, our solutions are compatible with a wide range of electronic driver identification technologies and provide indoor and outdoor vehicle/operator visibility through a combination of global positioning system (GPS) and RFID technologies, and geo-fencing to restrict vehicles from operating in prohibited areas or issue alerts upon unauthorized entry to such areas. Our solutions also support optional sensing elements to provide additional vehicle utilization data, including load detection data, battery data and activity meter data.
 
To analyze and benchmark vehicle utilization and operator productivity, our solutions automatically record a wide range of activity and enable detailed performance comparisons to help management make informed decisions about vehicle and manpower allocations. This can lead to operating cost savings through fleet and personnel reductions as well as increases in productivity. Our solutions also provide real-time and historical visibility of vehicle movements and other advanced asset management options.
 
To help reduce fleet maintenance costs, our solutions can automate and enforce preventative maintenance scheduling by:
 

● | wirelessly uploading usage data from each vehicle; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | defining various intervals and criteria for performing preventative maintenance; 
● | automatically prioritizing maintenance events based on weighted, user-defined variables; 
● | reporting in advance on vehicles with impending preventative maintenance events coming due; 
● | automatically sending reminders to individual vehicles or operators via the system’s text messaging module; and 
● | enabling remote lock-out of vehicles overdue for maintenance. 

 
Our solutions also enable maintenance personnel to locate and retrieve vehicles due for service via the system’s optional graphical viewer software and can provide automatic data feeds to our customers’ existing enterprise maintenance software systems.
 
A specialized application of our solution in the industrial fleet management and security market is vehicle security, particularly at airports, seaports and other areas of critical infrastructure. The airport market-specific version of our system is called AvRamp®, referencing the aviation industry and the ramp area at airports in which aircraft servicing equipment operates. To date, the most significant commercial deployment of the AvRamp system has been on fleets of aircraft ground support equipment at Newark Liberty International Airport for United Airlines and Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport for AMR Corporation (American Airlines and American Eagle Airlines).

Connected Vehicle Solutions (“PowerFleet for Automotive”)
 
In our connected vehicle solutions, we engage customers on unique IoT, M2M challenges that enable them to have considerable competitive advantage or to improve revenue or decrease their costs of operations.
 
For traditional rental fleet management, our system is designed both to enhance the consumer’s rental experience and benefit the rental company by providing information that can be used to increase revenues, reduce costs and improve customer service. Our rental fleet management system automatically uploads vehicle identification number, mileage and fuel data as a vehicle enters and exits the rental lot, which can significantly expedite the rental and return processes for travelers and provide the rental company with more timely inventory status, more accurate billing data that can generate higher fuel-related revenue, and an opportunity to utilize customer service personnel for more productive activities, such as inspecting vehicles for damage and helping customers with luggage.
 
Our solution for “car sharing” permits a rental car company to remotely control, track and monitor their rental vehicles wherever they are parked. Whether for traditional ‘pod-based’ rental or for the emerging rent-anywhere model, the system also (i) manages member reservations by smart phone or Internet, and (ii) charges members for vehicle use by the hour. The entire process - from remotely controlling the car door locks to tracking car mileage and fuel consumption to billing for the transaction - is automatically conducted by an integration of wireless vehicle management technology and the rental company’s fleet management software.
 
Analytics, Image Deep Learning and Lucy
 
Our analytics platforms for both industrial trucks and logistics assets provide our customers with a holistic view of their asset activity across an enterprise supply chain. Our image deep learning system allow us to process images from FreightCAM and other sources and identify key aspects of operations and geospatial information such as location, work being accomplished, type of cargo, how cargo is loaded and if there are any visible issues such as damage. Lucy, our deep learning voice integrated virtual analyst can help make the data and alerts actionable and can assist our customers by giving them a tireless virtual assistant.


These cloud-based software applications provide a single, integrated view of industrial asset activity across multiple locations, generating enterprise-wide benchmarks, peer-industry comparisons, and deeper insights into asset operations. Our analytics platforms can enable management to make more informed, effective decisions, raise asset performance standards, increase productivity, reduce costs, and enhance safety.
 
Specifically, our analytics platforms allow users to:
 

● | Quantify best-practice enterprise benchmarks for industrial asset utilization and safety;

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing objective is to achieve broad market penetration, with an emphasis both on expanding business opportunities with existing customers and on securing new customers.
 
We market our systems directly to commercial and government organizations and through indirect sales channels, such as original equipment manufacturers and industrial equipment dealers. In addition, we are actively pursuing strategic relationships with key companies in our target markets - including complementary hardware and software vendors and service providers - to further penetrate these markets by embedding our products in the assets our systems monitor and integrating our solutions with other systems.
 
We sell our systems to executive, division and site-level management within the enterprise. Typically, our initial system deployment serves as a basis for potential expansion across the customer’s organization.
 
We work closely with customers to help maximize the utilization and benefits of our system and demonstrate the value of enterprise-wide deployments.
 
Customers
 
We market and sell our wireless solutions to a wide range of customers in the commercial and government sectors. Our customers operate in diverse markets, such as automotive manufacturing, retail, shipping, freight transportation, heavy industry, wholesale distribution, aerospace and defense, homeland security, and vehicle rental.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated revenues of $53.1 million with Avis and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 18% and 10% of our revenues, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $41.0 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 16% of our revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated revenues of $36.8 million with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounting for 18% of our revenues.
 
The Company enters into master agreements with its customers in the normal course of its business. These agreements define the terms of any sales of products and/or services by the Company to the applicable customer, including, but not limited to, terms regarding payment, support services, termination and assignment rights. These agreements generally obligate the Company only when products or services are actually sold to the customer thereunder.
 
We strive to establish long-term relationships with our customers in order to maximize opportunities for new application development and increased sales.

Competition
 
The market for our solutions is rapidly evolving, highly competitive and fragmented. Our target markets are also subject to quickly changing product technologies, shifting customer needs, regulatory requirements and frequent introductions of new products and services. A significant number of companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for wireless products that currently compete or will compete directly with our solutions. We compete with organizations varying in size, including many small, start-up companies as well as large, well-capitalized organizations. While some of our competitors focus exclusively on providing wireless asset management solutions, many are involved in wireless technology as an extension of a broader business. Many of our larger competitors are able to dedicate extensive financial resources to the research and development and deployment of wireless solutions. As government and commercial entities expand the use of wireless technologies, we expect that competition will continue to increase within our target markets.
 
We attempt to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by focusing on three primary business solutions: (i) industrial truck management solutions, (ii) logistics visibility solutions, and (iii) connected vehicle solutions. This focus has enabled us to direct product development efforts specifically suited for our target markets. Our on-asset devices are designed to operate independently of other system components, allowing for continuous asset control and data gathering even when the asset is out of wireless communication range. We believe that our proprietary technology as well as our experience in designing and developing products for our target markets distinguishes us within these markets.
 
In each of our markets, we encounter different competitors due to the dynamics of each market. In the industrial truck asset management market, we are not aware of any competitors that can provide the precise capabilities of our systems due to our intellectual property and proprietary solutions; however, competitors do provide similar solutions that seek to address the same customer needs that our products address. Those companies include both emerging companies with limited operating histories, such as Gem One Corp., TotalTrax Inc., and SpeedShield Technologies and companies with longer operating histories, greater name recognition and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than ours, such as Crown Equipment Corp.
 
In the logistics visibility solutions market, we compete against several established competitors, including Omnitracs, LLC, SkyBitz, Inc., Orbcomm Inc. and Spireon, Inc. We attempt to differentiate our solutions in this market by offering a choice of communication mode (satellite or cellular), patented battery management technology, sensor options, and installation configurations (tractors, trucks, refrigerated trailers, dry van trailers, domestic containers, flatbed trailers, covered hopper and tanker railcars, and chassis).
 
In the connected vehicles solutions market, our solutions for traditional airport-based rental fleet management compete primarily against OEM connected vehicle offerings, after-market connected vehicle technology providers, and existing handheld devices which are used widely by vehicle rental companies. Currently, the principal OEMs we compete against are OnStar Corporation a subsidiary of General Motors, Ford Sync, and Toyota Connected; the primary after-market connected vehicle technology provider we compete against is Continental AG; and principal handheld device providers we compete against include Motorola and Intermec which was acquired by Honeywell International Inc. Our solutions for remote, decentralized rental fleet management compete primarily with companies in the traditional car sharing market such as Hertz, Enterprise, and car2go and peer-to-peer car sharing services such as Turo. Large system integrators and several of the national cellular wireless providers have started to offer solutions, which package third party hardware, firmware and software, that compete with our solutions. In the markets for both types of rental fleet solutions, our competitive position is differentiated by our patented product offering - a fully automated, readily installed, secure, and cost-effective car rental system.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development team has expertise in areas such as software and firmware development, database design and data analytics, wireless communications, mechanical and electrical engineering, and both product and project management. In addition, we utilize external contractors to supplement our team in the areas of software and firmware development, digital design, test development and product-level testing.


Generally, our research and development efforts are focused on: simplifying the implementation, support and utilization of our systems; reducing the cost of our systems; increasing the reliability of our products; expanding the functionality of our systems to meet customer and market requirements; applying new advances in technology to enhance existing products; and building further competitive advantages through our intellectual property portfolio.
 
In 2018, we also focused our research and development investments in several key areas:
 

● | improving the reliability and performance of our legacy product line of over-the-road asset management solutions, including products tailored towards dry van trailers, intermodal containers and chassis; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | initiated new product functionality for Avis in preparation for the expansion of our program, to include key new features that enable expanded car rental capabilities; 
● | the optimization of our impact algorithm for industrial trucks, whereby the solution is fully self-calibrating and self-installing, and capable of distinguishing critical from non-critical impact events for safety and accountability purposes; 
● | Improving the performance and expanding features for our software for both industrial truck asset management and over-the-road asset management, designed to improve the customer experience and reduce support requirements; and 
● | improving business intelligence and data analytics tools to quantify and simplify customer benefit achievement, within a single deployed facility, across an enterprise, and compared to peers within the same industry.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents
 
We attempt to protect our technology and products through a variety of intellectual property protections, including the pursuit of patent protection in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Because of the differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights, the extent of protection provided by U.S. patents or proprietary rights owned by us may differ from that of their foreign counterparts. Where strategically appropriate, we will attempt to pursue suspected violators of our patents and, whenever possible, monetize our intellectual property.
 
I.D. Systems has built a portfolio of patents and patent applications relating to various aspects of its technology and products. As of March 21, 2019, the I.D. Systems patent portfolio includes 24 U.S. patents, 4 pending U.S. patent applications, 1 pending foreign patent application, and 1 foreign patent. With the timely payment of all maintenance fees, the U.S. patents have expiration dates falling between 2019 and 2038. I.D. Systems also has foreign patents and pending applications relating to its wireless asset management system, connected car product, and new features added to our vehicle management system. No single patent or patent family is considered material to the I.D. Systems business.
 
I.D. Systems’ subsidiary, Asset Intelligence LLC (“AI”), also utilizes patents to protect aspects of its intellectual property assets. The AI patent portfolio focuses on methods, systems, and devices for managing mobile assets and reducing power consumption in mobile assets. As of March 18, 2019, the AI patent portfolio includes 24 U.S. patents. With timely payments of all maintenance fees, the granted U.S. patents have expiration dates falling between 2021 and 2034. No single patent or family of patents is considered material to the AI business.
 
Trademarks
 
We have, or have applied for, trademark protection for I.D. SYSTEMS® and Design, the I.D. SYSTEMS Logo®, VEHICLE ASSET COMMUNICATOR®, AVRAMP® and Design, POWERFLEET®, POWERFLEET VISION®, POWERFLEET IQ®, VERIWISE IQ®, ASSET INTELLIGENCE®, didBOX®, FREIGHTCAM®, and KEYTROLLER®.
 
We attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development and sales efforts. However, it is difficult to proceed with certainty in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential at the time of the application filing, with regard to similar technologies. If we were to discover that our products violate third-party proprietary rights, we may not be able to:
 

● | obtain licenses to continue offering such products without substantial reengineering; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reengineer our products successfully to avoid infringement; 
● | obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; or 
● | litigate an alleged infringement successfully or settle without substantial expense and damage awards. 

 
Any claims against us relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if without merit, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources or in injunctions preventing us from distributing certain products. Such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult. In general, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual safeguards may not be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. Our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Manufacturing
 
We outsource our hardware manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers. This strategy enables us to focus on our core competencies - designing hardware and software systems and delivering solutions to customers - and avoid investing in capital-intensive electronics manufacturing infrastructure. Outsourcing also provides us with the ability to ramp up deliveries to meet increases in demand without increasing fixed expenses.
 
Our manufacturers are responsible for obtaining the necessary components and supplies to manufacture our products. While components and supplies are generally available from a variety of sources, manufacturers generally depend on a limited number of suppliers. In the past, unexpected demand for communication products has caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts and allocation of such parts by suppliers that had an adverse impact on the ability of manufacturers to deliver products as well as on the cost of producing such products.
 
Due to the general availability of manufacturers for our products, we do not believe that the loss of any of our manufacturers would have a long-term material adverse effect on our business, although there could be a short-term adverse effect on our business.
 
We generally attempt to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand for products, as well as to meet anticipated sales levels. If our product mix changes in unanticipated ways, or if sales for particular products do not materialize as anticipated, we may have excess inventory or inventory that becomes obsolete. In such cases, our operating results could be negatively affected.
 
Government Regulations
 
The use of radio emissions is subject to regulation in the United States by various federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Various state agencies also have promulgated regulations which concern the use of lasers and radio/electromagnetic emissions standards.
 
Regulatory changes in the United States and other countries in which we may operate in the future could require modifications to some of our products in order for us to continue manufacturing and marketing our products in those areas.
 
Our products intentionally transmit radio signals, including narrow band and spread spectrum signals, as part of their normal operation. We have obtained certification from the FCC for our products that require certification. Users of these products in the United States do not require any license from the FCC to use or operate our products. To market and sell our integrated wireless solutions in the European Union, we also utilize unlicensed radio spectra, and have obtained the required European Norm (EN) certifications.
 
In addition, some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state and local laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state and local laws governing chemical substances in electronic products.
 
The adoption of unfavorable regulations, or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical or otherwise adversely affect our ability to produce or market our products.
 
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2019, we had 138 full-time employees, including 8 employees based in Germany and the United Kingdom. Of our 138 total employees, 31 were engaged in customer service, 30 in product development (which includes engineering), 5 in new product management, 20 in operations, 31 in sales and marketing, 5 in information technology and 16 in executive, administration and finance. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
