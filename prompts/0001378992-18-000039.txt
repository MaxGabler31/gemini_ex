General
 
Berry Global Group, Inc. ("Berry," "we," or the "Company") is a leading global supplier of a broad range of innovative non-woven, flexible, and rigid products used every day within consumer and industrial end markets.  In fiscal 2018, no single customer represented more than 4% of net sales and our top ten customers represented 20% of net sales.  We believe our manufacturing processes and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce expenses positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.

These products range in size from four ounces to five gallons and are offered in various styles with accompanying lids, bails and handles.  Containers and lids are available decorated with in-mold-labeling, indirect flexographic print, digital printing, direct print, and other decoration technologies.

The majority of our tubes are sold in the personal care market, but we also sell our tubes in the pharmaceutical and household chemical markets.
Marketing, Sales, and Competition
 
We reach our large and diversified customer base through a direct sales force of dedicated professionals and the strategic use of distributors.  Our sales, production and support staff meet with customers to understand their needs and improve our product offerings and services.  Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.  In addition, because we serve common customers across segments, we have the ability to efficiently utilize our sales and marketing resources to minimize costs.
 
The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive.  Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price.  This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms.  Competitors include but are not limited to Silgan, Aptar, Reynolds, Intertape, 3M, Tredegar, Bemis, Avgol, and Fitesa.
 
Raw Materials
 
Our primary raw material is plastic resin.  In addition, we use other materials such as butyl rubber, adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes.  These raw materials are available from multiple sources and in general we purchase from a variety of global suppliers.  However, in certain regions we may source specific raw materials from a limited number of suppliers or on a sole-source basis.  While temporary shortages of raw materials can occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions.
Employees
 
As of the end of fiscal year 2018, we employed approximately 24,000 employees with 18% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees expire annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal 2019.  Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how.  While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.

Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
 
Our past and present operations and ownership of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict with any certainty that we will not incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations, contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material.
 
We may from time to time be required to conduct remediation of releases of regulated materials at our owned or operated facilities. None of our pending remediation projects are expected to result in material costs. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. We are not aware that any such notices are currently pending which are expected to result in material costs.
 
The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages, including certain packages we manufacture pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  Certain of our products are also regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act.  We believe that we use FDA approved resins and pigments in our products that directly contact food and drug products, and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements.
 
The plastics industry, including us, is subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and limits on the use of plastic products. Certain jurisdictions require products packaged in plastic containers to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us.  There can be no assurance that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
