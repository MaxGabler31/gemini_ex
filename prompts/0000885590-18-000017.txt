Item 1.    Business
Biovail Corporation (“Biovail”) was formed under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on February 18, 2000, as a result of the amalgamation of TXM Corporation and Biovail Corporation International. Biovail was continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the “CBCA”) effective June 29, 2005. In connection with the acquisition of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (“Valeant”) in September 2010, Biovail was renamed “Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.” 
Effective August 9, 2013, we continued from the federal jurisdiction of Canada to the Province of British Columbia, meaning that we became a company registered under the laws of the Province of British Columbia as if we had been incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. As a result of this continuance, our legal domicile became the Province of British Columbia, the Canada Business Corporations Act ceased to apply to us and we became subject to the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. 
Introduction
We are a global company whose mission is to improve people’s lives with our health care products. We develop, manufacture and market a range of branded, generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment, and aesthetics devices) and over-the-counter (“OTC”) products, primarily in the therapeutic areas of eye-health, gastroenterology and dermatology. We are delivering on our commitments as we build an innovative company dedicated to advancing global health.
The Company's portfolio of products falls into three reportable segments: (i) Bausch + Lomb/International, (ii) Branded Rx and (iii) U.S. Diversified Products. 

• | The Bausch + Lomb/International segment consists of: (i) sales in the U.S. of pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products, primarily comprised of Bausch + Lomb products, with a focus on the Vision Care, Surgical, Consumer and Ophthalmology Rx products and (ii) sales in Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East of branded pharmaceutical products, branded generic pharmaceutical products, OTC products, medical device products, and Bausch + Lomb products.


• | The Branded Rx segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) Salix products (gastrointestinal (“GI”) products), (ii) Ortho Dermatologics (dermatological products) and (iii) oncology (or Dendreon), dentistry and women’s health products (or Sprout). As a result of the divestiture of the Company's equity interest in Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Dendreon”) on June 28, 2017 and Sprout Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Sprout”) on December 20, 2017, the Company has exited the oncology and women's health business, respectively.


• | The U.S. Diversified Products segment consists of sales in the U.S. of: (i) pharmaceutical products, OTC products and medical device products in the areas of neurology and certain other therapeutic classes, including aesthetics which includes the Solta business and the Obagi business (the Obagi Sale was completed on November 9, 2017) and (ii) authorized generic (“AG”) products.

See Note 23, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these reportable segments.
Business Strategy 
We have found and continue to believe that there is significant opportunity in the: (i) eye-health, (ii) GI and (iii) dermatology businesses. We believe that our existing portfolio, commercial footprint and pipeline of product development projects position us to successfully compete in these markets and provide us with the greatest opportunity to build value for our shareholders. We identify these businesses as “core”, meaning that we believe we are best positioned to grow and develop them. We include our global Bausch + Lomb business in our Bausch + Lomb/International segment and our GI and dermatology businesses in our Branded Rx segment. By narrowing our focus, we have the opportunity to reduce complexity in our operations and maximize the value of our core businesses. In order to focus our efforts, we performed a review of our portfolio of assets within these core businesses to identify those products where we believe we have, and can maintain, a competitive advantage and we continue to define and shape our operations and business strategies around these assets.
As we are committed to our core businesses, we began analyzing what to do with those business units and assets that fall outside our definition of “core”. Although these businesses and assets may be solid, the focus of their product pipelines and geographic footprint were not fully aligned with the focus of our core businesses, and they were, therefore, at a disadvantage when 
1

competing against our core activities for resources and capital within the Company. In order to focus on our objectives, we divested certain of these businesses and assets, primarily in 2017, which in each case, were not aligned with our core business objectives. This step allowed us to better focus our internal resources on our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology businesses and provided us with significant sources of capital.
As a result of the improvement in our core businesses and the divestitures of businesses not aligned with our core business objectives, as well as reduced sales of products in other segments facing loss of exclusivity, we are seeing a greater portion of our revenues driven by our core businesses. In 2017 and 2016, our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology revenues collectively represented approximately 66% and 62% of our total revenues, respectively. We expect this percentage to increase in 2018, as our recent and expected product launches are focused on these core businesses, and we expect the year-over-year comparison to widen as a result of 2017 divestitures. We believe that the increase in this percentage in 2017 demonstrates our convictions in our core businesses.
We believe that we have a well-established product portfolio that is diversified within our core businesses and provides a sustainable revenue stream to fund our operations. Our long-term success is dependent upon our ability to continually refresh our pipeline, to provide innovative product launches that meet new and changing demands and replace other products that have lost momentum. We have a robust pipeline that not only provides for the next generation of our existing products, but is also poised to bring new product solutions to market. 
We believe our increased focus on innovative new products will allow us to maximize our profitability and bolster future growth. We develop these innovative new products through our output-focused research and development (“R&D”) model, which we believe allows us to advance certain development programs to drive future commercial growth, while creating efficiencies in our R&D efforts. This is achieved primarily by: 

• | focusing on innovation through our internal R&D, selected acquisitions and in-licensing;


• | focusing on critical skills and capabilities needed to bring new technologies to the market;


• | pursuing life-cycle management programs for currently marketed products to increase such products’ value during their commercial lives; and


• | acquiring dossiers and registrations for branded generic products in emerging markets, which require limited manufacturing start-up and development activities.

Other Revenues 
We generate alliance revenue and service revenue from the licensing of products and from contract services mainly in the areas of dermatology and topical medication. Contract service revenue is derived primarily from contract manufacturing for third parties. 
Research and Development
Our R&D organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials. Currently, we have approximately 100 R&D projects in the pipeline and we launched and/or relaunched over 120 products globally during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 1,000 dedicated R&D and quality assurance employees in 23 R&D facilities were involved in our R&D efforts. 
Our R&D expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015, were $361 million, $421 million and $334 million, respectively. In 2016, we increased our R&D expenditures as we transitioned away from the Company's previous strategy of growth by acquisition and moved toward our current strategy of organic growth supported by investment in R&D. 
Although R&D expense in 2017 was lower when compared to 2016 by $60 million, R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 4% in 2017 and 2016. The decrease in dollars spent in 2017 is attributable to year over year phasing, as we completed the R&D investment in SiliqTM and other recently launched products requiring investment in 2016, removed projects related to businesses divested in 2017 and rebalanced our portfolio to better align with our long-term plans and focus on our Bausch + Lomb, GI and dermatology businesses. 
Our investment in R&D reflects our commitment to drive organic growth through internal development of new products, a pillar of our new strategy. In 2018, we anticipate R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to exceed 4%, which demonstrates our consistent commitment to our organic growth supported by investment in R&D strategy. In the U.S. alone, we have 71 projects focused on our core businesses in our pipeline and anticipate submitting over 60% of those projects for FDA approval in 2018 and 2019.

Trademarks, Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality policies and procedures and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Trademarks
We believe that trademark protection is an important part of establishing product and brand recognition. We own or license a number of registered trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S., Canada and in various other countries throughout the world. U.S. federal registrations for trademarks remain in force for 10 years and may be renewed every 10 years after issuance, provided the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademark registrations in Canada remain in force for 15 years and may be renewed every 15 years after issuance, provided that, as in the case of U.S. federal trademark registrations, the mark is still being used in commerce. Other countries generally have similar but varying terms and renewal policies with respect to trademarks registered in those countries.
Data and Patent Exclusivity
For certain of our products, we rely on a combination of regulatory and patent rights to protect the value of our investment in the development of these products.
A patent is the grant of a property right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among other things, selling the subject invention in, or importing such invention into, the jurisdiction that granted the patent. In the U.S., Canada and the European Union (“EU”), generally patents expire 20 years from the date of application. We have obtained, acquired or in-licensed a number of patents and patent applications covering key aspects of certain of our principal products. In the aggregate, our patents are of material importance to our business taken as a whole. However, we do not consider any single patent material to our business as a whole. 
In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides non-patent regulatory exclusivity for five years from the date of the first FDA approval of a new drug compound in a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The FDA, with one exception, is prohibited during those five years from accepting for filing a generic, or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”), that references the NDA. In reference to the foregoing exception, if a patent is indexed in the FDA Orange Book for the new drug compound, a generic may file an ANDA four years from the NDA approval date if it also files a Paragraph IV Certification with the FDA challenging the patent. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA. However, the NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to independently demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A similar data exclusivity scheme exists in the EU, whereby only the pioneer drug company can use data obtained at the pioneer’s expense for up to eight years from the date of the first approval of a drug by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and no generic drug can be marketed for ten years from the approval of the innovator product. Under both the U.S. and the EU data exclusivity programs, products without patent protection can be marketed by others so long as they repeat the clinical trials necessary to show safety and efficacy. Canada employs a similar data exclusivity regulatory regime for innovative drugs.
In the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act ("BPCIA") allows companies to seek FDA approval to manufacture and sell biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products. Due to the size and complexity of biological products, as compared to small molecule drugs, a biosimilar must be “highly similar” to the reference product with “no clinically meaningful differences” in safety, purity and potency between the two. The BPCIA provides reference product sponsors with 12 years (potential for 6 additional months of pediatric exclusivity) of market exclusivity, but unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act which covers small molecules, it does not require reference product sponsors to list patents in an Orange Book equivalent and does not include an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval upon the timely filing of a lawsuit. The BPCIA, however, does provide pre-litigation procedures for the parties to follow, including identification of relevant patents and each party’s basis for infringement and invalidity.  A biosimilar patent application cannot be filed until four years after the reference product is first licensed and a biosimilar cannot be launched, at the earliest (assumes no patent litigation or an adverse decision on all patents), until the expiration of the twelve years of data exclusivity from the approval of the reference product.  
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or a disease whose incidence rates number more than 200,000 where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. The sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years.
6

Proprietary Know-How
We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of our principal products. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Government Regulations 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, in Canada, in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. As such, our products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions or criminal prosecution.
Prior to human use, FDA approval (drugs (in the form of an NDA or ANDA for generic equivalents), biologics (in the form of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”)) and some medical devices) or marketing clearance (other devices) must be obtained in the U.S., approval by Health Canada must be obtained in Canada, EMA approval (drugs) or a CE Marking (devices) must be obtained for countries that are part of the EU and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to manufacturing or marketing new pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Generally, preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must first be conducted and the results submitted to the applicable regulatory agency (such as the FDA) for approval. 
 Regulation by other federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and state and local authorities in the U.S., and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries, is also required. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the FDA and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of medical devices, prescription drugs, OTC drugs and cosmetics. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products. The FDA requires a Boxed Warning (sometimes referred to as a “Black Box” Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events and similar warnings are also required to be displayed on the product in certain other jurisdictions.
Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are required to comply with manufacturing regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and quality system management requirements, enforced by the FDA and Health Canada, in the U.S. and Canada respectively, and similar regulations enforced by regulatory agencies in other countries and we face annual audits of our facilities and plants and those of our contract manufacturers by the FDA and such other regulatory agencies. In addition, we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in many countries in which we operate.
We are also subject to extensive U.S. federal and state health care marketing and fraud and abuse regulations, such as the federal False Claims Act, federal and provincial marketing regulation in Canada and similar regulations in foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The federal False Claims Act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit (or cause the submission of) false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal or state health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some state anti-kickback laws also prohibit such conduct where commercial insurance, rather than federal or state, programs are involved. Due to recent legislative changes, violations of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. In addition, in the U.S. and Canada, companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for “off-label” uses - that is, uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA or Health Canada, respectively - and “off-label promotion” in the U.S. has also formed the predicate for False Claims Act liability resulting in significant financial settlements. These and other laws and regulations, rules and policies may significantly impact the manner in which we are permitted to market our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
7

We may also be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, "HIPAA"). HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions (e.g., health care claims information and plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment, coordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. These standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. Complying with these laws involves costs to our business, and failure to comply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Successful commercialization of our products may depend, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Third party payors may include government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the U.S., the E.U. and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, which has resulted in lower average realized prices. In the U.S., these pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In particular, sales of our products may be subject to discounts from list price and rebate obligations, as well as formulary coverage decisions impacting or limiting the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided. Various U.S. health care and other laws regulate our interactions with government agencies, private insurance companies and other third party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for our products. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. In countries outside the U.S., the success of our products may depend, at least in part, on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because, in many countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with certain governmental authorities for newly developed products can delay commercialization. In Canada and many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, tenders and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase.
See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with these regulations and related matters.
Environmental and Other Regulation 
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in both the U.S. and countries outside the U.S. (including Canada), including those governing the discharges of substances into the air, water and land, the handling treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater and solid waste, the cleanup of contaminated properties and other environmental matters. Certain of our development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous substances. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure, however, that environmental liabilities relating to us or facilities owned, leased or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such liabilities, if they were to develop, would require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what environmental legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.

We currently promote our pharmaceutical products to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers through our own sales force and sell through wholesalers. In some markets, we additionally sell directly to physicians, hospitals and large drug store chains and we sell through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our marketing program for pharmaceuticals, we use direct to customer advertising, direct mailings, advertise in trade and medical periodicals, exhibit products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia.
Competition
Competitive Landscape for Products and Products in Development
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. Our competitors include specialty and other large pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, biotechnology companies, OTC companies and generic manufacturers, in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and in other countries in which we market our products. The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC and cosmeceutical sectors. With respect to the GI market, generic entrants continue to capture significant share for treatment of many GI conditions. In the area of irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS") and opioid induced constipation ("OIC"), competitors have recently launched new competing products, which should increase the size of these markets and intensify competition. The market for Bausch + Lomb products is very competitive, both across product categories and geographies. In addition to larger diversified pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we face competition in the eye-health market from mid-size and smaller, regional and entrepreneurial companies with fewer products in niche areas or regions. 
Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology, GI, eye-health and other therapeutic areas. Academic and other research and development institutions may also develop products or technologies that compete with our products, which technologies and products may be acquired or licensed by our competitors. These competitors may have greater financial, R&D or marketing resources than we do. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors.
We sell a broad range of products, and competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which the products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Generic Competition and Loss of Exclusivity
We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products when patents covering certain of our currently marketed products expire or are successfully challenged or when the regulatory exclusivity for our products expires or is otherwise lost. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.
For details regarding products that are facing generic competition, products that are potentially facing generic competition, the corresponding potential revenue impact and infringement proceedings we initiated against potential generic competition, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Our Transformation” of this Form 10-K. See Note 21, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding certain infringement proceedings. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on our competition risks.
Manufacturing 
We currently operate approximately 40 manufacturing plants worldwide. All of our manufacturing facilities that require certification from the FDA, Health Canada or foreign agencies have obtained such approval.
We also subcontract the manufacturing of certain of our products, including products manufactured under the rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies. Products representing approximately 40% of our product sales for 2017 are produced by third party manufacturers under manufacturing arrangements.

In some cases, the principal raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredient, used by us (or our third party manufacturers) for our various products are purchased in the open market or are otherwise available from several sources. However, some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials used in our products and some of the finished products themselves are currently only available from a single source; or others may in the future become available from only one source. For example, with respect to some of our largest or most significant products, the supply of the finished product for each of our Siliq™, Vyzulta™, SofLens®, Wellbutrin XL®, Occuvite®, PreserVision®, Renu®, Isuprel®, Xenazine®, Uceris® tablet, Relistor® Oral and PureVision® products are only available from a single source and the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredient for each of our Siliq™, Isuprel®, Xenazine®, Relistor® Oral and Uceris® tablet products are also only available from a single source. Any disruption in the supply of any such single-sourced active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw material or finished product or an increase in the cost of such materials or products could adversely impact our ability to manufacture or sell such products, the ability of our third party manufacturers to supply us with such products, or our profitability. We attempt to manage the risks associated with reliance on single sources of active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw materials or finished products by carrying additional inventories or, where possible, developing second sources of supply. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our manufacturing arrangements.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 20,700 employees. These employees included approximately 10,700 in production, 7,500 in sales and marketing, 1,500 in general and administrative positions and 1,000 in R&D. Collective bargaining exists for some employees in a number of countries in which we do business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
Product Liability Insurance
Since March 31, 2014, we have self-insured substantially all of our product liability risk for claims arising after that date. In the future, we will continue to re-evaluate our decision to self-insure and may purchase additional product liability insurance to cover product liability risk. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Seasonality of Business
Historically, revenues from our business tend to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Sales in the first quarter tend to be lower as patient co-pays and deductibles reset at the beginning of each year.  Sales in the fourth quarter tend to be higher based on consumer and customer purchasing patterns associated with health care reimbursement programs. However, there are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.
Geographic Areas
A significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations or otherwise earned outside the U.S. and Canada. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including possible nationalization or expropriation. Changes in the relative values of currencies may materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
See Note 23, "SEGMENT INFORMATION" to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area.
In 2017, a significant portion of our revenue and income was earned in Ireland and Luxembourg, which have low tax rates. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K relating to tax rates.
