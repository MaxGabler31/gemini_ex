ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”, “Elite”, “Elite Pharmaceuticals”, the “registrant”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated on October 1, 1997 under the laws of the State of Delaware, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Elite Laboratories, Inc. (“Elite Labs”), was incorporated on August 23, 1990 under the laws of the State of Delaware. On January 5, 2012, Elite Pharmaceuticals was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.
 
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company principally engaged in the development and manufacture of oral, controlled-release products and the manufacture of generic pharmaceuticals. Our strategy includes developing generic versions of controlled-release drug products with high barriers to entry.
 
We occupy manufacturing, warehouse, laboratory and office space at 165 Ludlow Avenue and 135 Ludlow Avenue in Northvale, NJ (the “Northvale Facility”). The Northvale Facility operates under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) and is a United States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) registered facility for research, development, and manufacturing. Our website address is www.elitepharma.com.
 
Strategy
 
We focus our efforts on the following areas: (i) manufacturing of a line of generic pharmaceutical products with approved Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”); (ii) development of additional generic pharmaceutical products; (iii) development of the other products in our pipeline including products co-developed with partners; (iv) commercial exploitation of our products either by sales under our own label, license and the collection of royalties, or through the manufacture of our formulations; and (v) development of new products for sale under our own label, and the expansion of our licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies, including co-development projects, joint ventures and other collaborations.
 
We continue to evaluate opportunities for the development of various types of drug products, including branded drug products which require New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) under Section 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Drug Price Competition Act”) as well as generic drug products which require ANDAs.
 
We believe that our business strategy enables us to reduce its risk by having a diverse product portfolio that includes both branded and generic products in various therapeutic categories and to build collaborations and establish licensing agreements with companies with greater resources thereby allowing us to share costs of development and improve cash-flow.

Products Under FDA Review
 
SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone
 
SequestOx™ is our abuse-deterrent candidate for the management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate. SequestOx™ is an immediate-release Oxycodone Hydrochloride containing sequestered Naltrexone which incorporates 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg doses of oxycodone into capsules.
 
In January 2016, the Company submitted a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application for SequestOx™, after receiving a waiver of the $2.3 million filing fee from the FDA. In March 2016, the Company received notification of the FDA’s acceptance of this filing and that such filing has been granted priority review by the FDA with a target action under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) of July 14, 2016.

On July 15, 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, regarding the NDA. The CRL stated that the review cycle for the SequestOx™ NDA is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form.
 
On July 7, 2017, the Company reported topline results from a pivotal bioequivalence fed study for or SequestOx™. The mean Tmax (the amount of time that a drug is present at the maximum concentration in serum) of SequestOx™ was 4.6 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. and the mean Tmax of the comparator, Roxicodone®, was 3.4 hr. with a range of 0.5 hr. to 12 hr. A key objective for the study was to determine if the reformulated SequestOx™ had a similar Tmax to the comparator when taken with a high fat meal. Based on these results, the Company paused clinical trials for this formulation of SequestOx™. On January 30, 2018, the Company reported positive topline results from a pilot study conducted for a modified SequestOx™ wherein, based on the results of this pilot study, the modified SequestOx™ formulation is expected to achieve bioequivalence with a Tmax range equivalent to the reference product when conducted in a pivotal trial under fed conditions. The Company has provided the pilot data to the FDA, requesting clarification as to the requirements for resubmission of the NDA. The FDA has provided guidance for repeated bio-equivalence studies in order to bridge the new formulation to the original SequestOx™ studies and also extended our filing fee waiver until July 2023. Due to the prohibitive cost of such repeated bio-equivalence studies and the uncertain commercial viability given the regulatory and competitive landscape, the Company has paused development of this product.
 
There can be no assurances of the Company conducting future clinical trials, or if such trials are conducted, there can be no assurances of the success of any future clinical trials, or if such trials are successful, there can be no assurances that an intended future resubmission of the NDA product filing, if made, will be accepted by or receive marketing approval from the FDA. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues or profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure this marketing authorization.
 
Oxycodone Hydrochloride extended release (generic version of OxyContin®)
 
On September 20, 2017, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for generic version of OxyContin® (extended release Oxycodone Hydrochloride). OxyContin® is approved for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. IMS reported approximately $2.3 billion in revenue for OxyContin® and its equivalents in 2016. The FDA requested additional information relating to this filing, compliance with which would require significant resources. Development of this product has been reinitiated with a target filing in Q1 2023 .
 
There can be no assurances that any of these products will receive marketing authorization and achieve commercialization. In addition, even if marketing authorization is received, there can be no assurances that there will be future revenues or profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.
 
Approved Products Not Yet Commercialized
 
Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate
 
The Company received approval on September 10, 2019 from the FDA of an ANDA for a generic version of Tylenol® with Codeine (acetaminophen and codeine phosphate) 300mg/7.5mg, 300mg/15mg, 300mg/30mg and 300mg/60mg tablets. Acetaminophen with codeine is a combination medication indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Acetaminophen with codeine products have annual U.S. sales of approximately $45 million according to IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS Health Data). The Company is not pursuing licensing deals for any opioids at this time until the market changes. The Company will wait for the market to stabilize before pursuing these opportunities.
 
There can be no assurances in relation to any of the above approved products not yet commercialized, that there will be future revenues of profits, or that any such future revenues or profits would be in amounts that provide adequate return on the significant investments made to secure these marketing authorizations.
 
Generic version of an antibiotic product
 
On January 3, 2019, the Company filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of an antibiotic product. According to QVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS Health) data, the branded product for this antibiotic and its equivalents had total annual U.S. sales of approximately $85 million for the twelve months ending September 30, 2019. The product is jointly owned by Elite and Praxgen Pharmaceuticals LLC, formerly SunGen Pharma LLC, (“Praxgen”). The product was approved in April 2022.
 
Discontinued and Transferred Products
 
As part of standard operating practices, the Company, from time to time, as relevant, conducts evaluations of all ANDAs owned, consisting, without limitation, of ANDAs acquired or approved prior to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”) and ANDAs acquired or approved during the Fiscal 2022. Such evaluations include, without limitation, costs and benefits relating to each ANDA owned, with such costs including those fees required under the FDA’s Generic Drug User Fee Amendment (“GDUFA”) which is significantly influenced by the number of ANDAs owned, and other costs and benefits taking into consideration various specific market factors for each ANDA. Those ANDAs with a cost/benefit profile not consistent with management criteria for continuation are identified for disposition and effort is made to determine the optimal course of action to achieve disposition of the ANDA.

Products Under Development
 
Elite’s research and development activities include developing its proprietary abuse deterrent technology and the development of a range of abuse deterrent opioid products that utilize this technology or other approaches to abuse deterrence.
 
Elite’s proprietary abuse-deterrent technology utilizes the pharmacological approach to abuse deterrence and consists of a multi-particulate capsule which contains an opioid agonist in addition to naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. When this product is taken as intended, the naltrexone is designed to pass through the body unreleased while the opioid agonist releases over time providing therapeutic pain relief for which it is prescribed. If the multi-particulate beads are crushed or dissolved, the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, is designed to release. The absorption of the naltrexone is intended to block the euphoria by preferentially binding to same receptors in the brain as the opioid agonist and thereby reducing the incentive for abuse or misuse by recreational drug abusers.

We filed an NDA for the first product to utilize our abuse deterrent technology, Immediate Release Oxycodone 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 30mg with sequestered Naltrexone (collectively and individually referred to as “SequestOx™”), on January 14, 2016. Please see “Filed products under FDA review; SequestOx™ - Immediate Release Oxycodone with sequestered Naltrexone” above and please note that continued development of this product is currently paused.
 
The Company is currently not selling and is evaluating the market place when deciding to proceed with the above listed filed applications.
 
Please note that, while the FDA is required to review applications within certain timeframes, during the review process, the FDA frequently requests that additional information be submitted. The effect of such requests and subsequent submissions can significantly extend the time for the FDA review process. Until a product is actually approved, there can be no assurances that the information requested and submitted will be considered adequate by the FDA to justify approval. The packaging and labeling of our approved products are also subject to FDA regulation. Based on the foregoing, it is impossible to anticipate the amount of time that will be needed to obtain FDA approval and to commercialize a product, if approved. In addition, there can be no assurances of the Company filing the required application(s) with the FDA or of the FDA approving such application(s) if filed. The Company’s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products incorporating its abuse deterrent technology is subject to a high level of risk as detailed in “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Abuse-Deterrent and Sustained Release Opioids
 
The abuse-deterrent opioid products utilize our patented abuse-deterrent technology that is based on a pharmacological approach. These products are combinations of a narcotic agonist formulation intended for use in patients with pain, and an antagonist, formulated to deter abuse of the drug. Both, agonist, and antagonist, have been on the market for a number of years and sold separately in various dose strengths.
 
The Company is currently not selling opioids and is evaluating the market place when deciding to proceed with the above listed filed applications.

Patents
 
Since our incorporation, we have secured the following patents, of which two have been assigned for a fee to another pharmaceutical company. Our patents are:
 

PATENT | EXPIRATION DATE 
------------------------------+--------------------
U.S. patent 8,182,836 | March 2024 
U.S. patent 8,425,933 | March 2025 
U.S. patent 8,703,186 | March 2025 
Canadian patent 2,521,655 | April 2023 
Canadian patent 2,541,371 | April 2024 
U.S. patent 9,056,054 | June 2030 
U.S. patent 10,213,388 | June 2030 

 
We intend to apply for patents for other products in the future; however, there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications or other applications which we may file will be granted. We have also filed corresponding foreign applications for key patents.
 
Prior to the enactment in the United States of new laws adopting certain changes mandated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”), the exclusive rights afforded by a U.S. Patent were for a period of 17 years measured from the date of grant. Under GATT, the term of any U.S. Patent granted on an application filed subsequent to June 8, 1995 terminates 20 years from the date on which the patent application was filed in the United States or the first priority date, whichever occurs first. Future patents granted on an application filed before June 8, 1995, will have a term that terminates 20 years from such date, or 17 years from the date of grant, whichever date is later.
 
Under the Drug Price Competition Act, a U.S. product patent or use patent may be extended for up to five years under certain circumstances to compensate the patent holder for the time required for FDA regulatory review of the product. Such benefits under the Drug Price Competition Act are available only to the first approved use of the active ingredient in the drug product and may be applied only to one patent per drug product. There can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of this law.
 
Also, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents, and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance, therefore, that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention, or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country. Furthermore, even if our patents are determined to be valid, enforceable, and broad in scope, there can be no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around such patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology.

Other Business Factors and Details
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds, on which our success depends, are intensely regulated by governmental regulatory agencies, in particular the FDA and DEA. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, injunction actions and criminal prosecution based on products or manufacturing practices that violate statutory requirements. In addition, administrative remedies can involve voluntary withdrawal of products, as well as the refusal of the FDA to approve ANDAs and NDAs. The FDA also has the authority to withdraw approval of drugs in accordance with statutory due process procedures.
 
Before a drug may be marketed, it must be approved by the FDA either through an NDA or an ANDA, each of which is discussed below.
 
NDAs and NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) of the Drug Price Competition Act
 
The FDA approval procedure for an NDA is generally a two-step process. During the initial product development stage, an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for each product is filed with the FDA. The IND contains results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and pharmacodynamics characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND is required by the FDA prior to the commencement of initial clinical testing. If the FDA does not comment on or question the IND within such 30-day period, initial clinical studies may begin. If, however, the FDA has comments or questions, they must be answered to the satisfaction of the FDA before initial clinical testing may begin. In some instances, this process could result in substantial delay and expense. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 
Phase One: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing;
 
Phase Two: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning;
 
Phase Three: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development nonclinical and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. It could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may offer conditional approval subject to, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.


Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities in any foreign country must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in that country. We intend to conduct all marketing in territories other than the United States through other pharmaceutical companies based in those countries. The approval procedure varies from country to country, can involve additional testing, and the time required may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general each country has its own procedures and requirements, many of which are time consuming and expensive. Thus, there can be substantial delays in obtaining required approvals from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed. After such approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before the products become commercially available.
 
NDAs under Section 505(b)(2)
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a NCE, listed in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book,” for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory/ approval.


ANDAs
 
To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they cannot include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer must rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

In order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in the Orange Book. Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 
When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, it is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product.
 
If the follow-on applicant does not challenge the innovator’s listed patents, FDA will not approve the ANDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the follow-on applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
In May 1992, Congress enacted the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, which allows the FDA to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit certain illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process. In some situations, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act requires the FDA to not accept or review ANDAs for a period of time from a company or an individual that has committed certain violations. It also provides for temporary denial of approval of applications during the investigation of certain violations that could lead to debarment and also, in more limited circumstances, provides for the suspension of the marketing of approved drugs by the affected company. Lastly, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act allows for civil penalties and withdrawal of previously approved applications. Neither we nor any of our employees have ever been subject to debarment. We do not believe that we receive any services from any debarred person.
 
Controlled Substances
 
The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation, exportation, disposal and other requirements under the oversight of the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III-V substances.
 
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. Certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, however, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
 
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances.
 
For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies. The DEA quota system was amended in 2018 to require sponsors to strengthen controls over diversion of controlled substances, controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. In November 2017, the DEA reduced the amount of almost every Schedule II opiate and opioid medication that may be manufactured in the U.S. in calendar year 2018 by 20%. For 2019, the DEA proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including oxycodone, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas. The DEA proposed further decreasing manufacturing quotas in 2020 for five of the six opioids (fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone), by an average of 28%. In October 2019, the DEA proposed additional regulations to amend the manner in which the agency grants quotas to manufacturers. The proposed regulations will establish use-specific quotas, including commercial sales, product development, transfer, replacement and packaging. To decrease the risk of diversion and increase accountability, inventory allowances will be reduced, and procurement quota certifications will be required. In April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DEA adjusted the established 2020 aggregate production quotas and assessment of annual needs for select Schedule II substances. The DEA took this action to ensure that the country has an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances during the public health emergency.

Federal laws have been enacted to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and illicit opioid use. In 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (“CARA”), was enacted to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. CARA expands the availability of naloxone for law enforcement and other first responders, forms an interagency task force to develop best practices for pain management with opioid medications and provides resources to improve state monitoring of opioids. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (“SUPPORT Act”), which was signed into law in November 2018, includes a number of measures directed towards regulation and improvement of treatment for substance use-disorder and increased coverage by CMS of medically-assisted treatment options. In addition, the SUPPORT Act requires HHS to report to Congress on existing barriers to access to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations by Medicare Part C and D beneficiaries
 
The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on business, operations and financial conditions. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Our activities are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil False Claims Act, and laws and regulations pertaining to limitations on and reporting of healthcare provider payments (physician sunshine laws). These laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced by various federal, state and local authorities including CMS, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These laws include:

● | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through “qui tam,” or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government; 
● | U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal liability and amends provisions on the reporting, investigation, enforcement, and penalizing of civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
● | state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and 
● | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers are required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided, as well as ownership and investment interests held, during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. 

 
Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, may subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions including penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and/or adverse publicity.
 
Moreover, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical products, including state investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the marketing of opioid products.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Enforcement actions may be brought by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchanges Commission (“SEC”), and recent enacted legislation has expanded the SEC’s power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under the FCPA from five years to ten years.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific details, information on cost-effectiveness, and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and related services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that third-party payors, including government payors, will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.


Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air polluting emissions, waste water discharges, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities, including the past practices of corporations as to which we are the legal successor or in possession. We do not expect that compliance with such environmental laws will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in environmental laws or regulations, administrative actions or enforcement actions, or remediation obligations arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Competition
 
We have competition with respect to our principal areas of operation. We develop and manufacture generic products, products using controlled-release drug technology, products utilizing abuse deterrent technologies, and we develop and market (either on our own or by license to other companies) generic and proprietary controlled-release and abuse deterrent pharmaceutical products. In both areas, our competition consists of those companies which develop controlled release, abuse deterrent drugs and alternative drug delivery systems. We do not represent a significant presence in the pharmaceutical industry.

An increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have become interested in the development and commercialization of products incorporating advanced or novel drug delivery systems. Some of the major pharmaceutical companies have invested and are continuing to invest significant resources in the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies and some have invested funds in such specialized drug delivery companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources as well as more experience than we do in commercializing pharmaceutical products. Certain companies have a track record of success in developing controlled-release drugs. Significant among these are, without limitation, Pfizer, Sandoz (a Novartis company), Mylan Laboratories, Inc., Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., Amneal Laboratories, Inc., Mallinckrodt, and Aurobindo. Each of these companies has developed expertise in certain types of drug delivery systems, although such expertise does not carry over to developing a controlled-release version of all drugs. Such companies may develop new drug formulations and products or may improve existing drug formulations and products more efficiently than we can. In addition, almost all of our competitors have vastly greater resources than we do. While our product development capabilities and, if obtained, patent protection may help us to maintain our market position in the field of advanced drug delivery, there can be no assurance that others will not be able to develop such capabilities or alternative technologies outside the scope of our patents, if any, or that even if patent protection is obtained, such patents will not be successfully challenged in the future.
 
In addition to competitors that are developing products based on drug delivery technologies, there are also companies that have announced that they are developing opioid abuse-deterrent products that might compete directly or indirectly with Elite’s products. These include, but are not limited to Pfizer Inc., Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Purdue Pharma LP.
 
We also face competition in the generic pharmaceutical market. The principal competitive factors in the generic pharmaceutical market include: (i) introduction of other generic drug manufacturers’ products in direct competition with our products under development, (ii) introduction of authorized generic products in direct competition with any of our products under development, particularly if such products are approved and sold during exclusivity periods, (iii) consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers and acquisitions and the formation of buying groups, (iv) ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or exclusivity periods, diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits, (v) the willingness of generic drug customers, including wholesale and retail customers, to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers, (vi) pricing pressures and product deletions by competitors, (vii) a company’s reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of quality products, (viii) a company’s level of service (including maintaining sufficient inventory levels for timely deliveries), (ix) product appearance and labelling and (x) a company’s breadth of product offerings.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Manufacturing
 
A significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources. Foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad, including:

● | Greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The relative instability of some foreign governments and economies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interim price volatility based on labor unrest, materials or equipment shortages, export duties, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights.

While we currently obtain the raw materials that we need from over 20 suppliers, some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers. The FDA requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products. If raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier, FDA approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved.

We have acquired pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment for manufacturing our products. We have registered our facilities with the FDA and the DEA.
 
Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We are dependent on a small number of customers, suppliers and other third parties for core business aspects.”
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
Each year we have had one or a few customers that have accounted for a large percentage of our limited revenues, therefore the termination or restructuring of a contract with a customer may result in the loss of material amount or substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new customers, but despite these efforts we may not, at the time that any of our current contracts expire, have other contracts in place generating similar or material revenue. We have agreements with Lannett Company, Prasco, LLC, Epic Pharma, LLC, and TAGI Pharma, LLC for the licensing, sales and distribution of products that we manufacture. We receive revenues to manufacture these products and also receive a profit split or royalties based on in-market sales of the products. Please see the Risk Factor in Part I, Item 1A entitled “We are dependent on a small number of customers, suppliers and other third parties for core business aspects.”
Our Reporting Segments
 
We currently operate in two segments, which are products whose marketing approvals were secured via an ANDA and products whose marketing approvals were secured via an NDA. ANDA products are referred to as generic pharmaceuticals and NDA products are referred to as branded pharmaceuticals. For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 revenue from our ANDA segment were $32.3 million and $25.2 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 revenue from our NDA segment were $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
 
Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who we have determined to be the chief executive office, for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company. There are currently no intersegment revenues. Asset information by operating segment is not presented below since the chief operating decision maker does not review this information by segment.
 
Employees
 
As of June 15, 2022, we had 43 full time employees. Full-time employees are engaged in operations, administration, research, and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relationship with our employees to be good. However, our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon our continuing ability to attract, integrate, retain, and motivate highly qualified personnel, and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel.
