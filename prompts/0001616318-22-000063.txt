Planned Separation of Outdoor Products and Sporting Products
On May 5, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors has unanimously approved preparations for the separation of our Outdoor Products and Sporting Products reportable segments into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the “Planned Separation”). We anticipate that the transaction will be in the form of a distribution to our shareholders of 100% of the stock of Outdoor Products, which will become a new, independent publicly traded company. The distribution is intended to be tax-free to U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We currently expect the transaction will be completed in calendar year 2023, subject to final approval by our Board of Directors, a Form 10 registration statement being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed.
We expect that the Planned Separation will create a number of benefits for Outdoor Products and Sporting Products, including:
•Enhanced strategic focus with supporting resources: Each company will have enhanced strategic focus with resources to support its specific operational needs and growth drivers. 
•Tailored capital allocation priorities: Each company will have a tailored capital allocation philosophy that is better suited to support its distinctive business model and long-term goals.
•Strengthened ability to attract and retain top talent: Each company will benefit from enhanced ability to attract and retain top talent that is ideally suited to execute its strategic and operational objectives. 
•Compelling value for shareholders: Each company will present a differentiated and compelling investment opportunity based on its particular business model.

•Expanded strategic opportunities: Improved focus will allow Outdoor Products to further cement its reputation as the acquirer of choice through continued M&A in the outdoor recreation products marketplace and enable Sporting Products to secure attractive partnerships with other manufacturers.

Our broad range of consumers include outdoor enthusiasts, hunters and recreational shooters, golfers, cyclists, backyard grillers, campers, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals.

Our Brands
Our brands are renowned and market leaders in most of their categories. Many of our brands have a rich, long-standing heritage, such as Remington Ammunition, founded in 1816, Federal Premium, founded in 1922 and Bushnell, founded in 1948. We also have brands who have emerged with consumer and technological advances, such as e-bike business QuietKat and golf technology business Foresight Sports. We believe this brand heritage supports our leading market share positions in multiple categories. For example, we believe we hold the No.1 sales position in the U.S. markets for commercial ammunition, golf rangefinders, bike and hike hydration packs, and biking helmets and accessories. To maintain the strength of our brands and drive revenue growth, we invest in product innovation to continuously improve the performance, quality, and affordability of our products while providing world-class customer support to our retail partners and end consumers.

Market Opportunity 
We participate in the global market for consumer goods geared toward outdoor recreation and hunting and recreational shooting related products. Spending on outdoor recreation products in the U.S., including the purchase of gear for bicycling, camping, fishing, hunting, motorcycling, off-roading, snow sports, trail sports, and wildlife viewing, contributed to the economies of all 50 states, and accounted for $374 billion of current-dollar gross domestic product and $689 billion in gross output (consumer spending) in 2020, according to The Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics report released in November, 2021. The report, which covered calendar year 2020, shows that the COVID-19 pandemic related declines in travel and tourism

had a large impact on outdoor recreation’s overall economic activity but that outdoor participation increased, especially those activities that can be done close-to-home.
Competitive Strengths 
Portfolio of Leading Brands Focused on Outdoor Recreation and Hunting and Sporting Related Products
We are the parent company of 39 renowned brands that design, manufacture and market sporting and outdoor products. Together we serve a broad and diverse range of consumers around the globe, including outdoor enthusiasts, golfers, cyclists, backyard grillers, campers, hunters, recreational shooters, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals.
Our reportable segments, Sporting Products and Outdoor Products, provide these consumers with a wide range of performance-driven, high-quality and innovative outdoor and sporting products. Our operating model leverages shared resources across brands to achieve levels of excellence and performance that would be out of reach for any one brand on its own.
We seek to maintain our brand strength by developing performance-enhancing innovations, introducing new products, engaging in product and brand marketing campaigns, providing marketing support to our strategic channel partners, utilizing shared resources through our Supply Chain and Digital Centers of Excellence, and establishing and maintaining a strong 
e-commerce presence to capitalize on the ongoing shift by consumers to online shopping. We target selling prices that balance our premium positioning with our focus on affordability to capture a large, diverse and dynamic consumer base. Our brand strength and product innovations allow us to drive sales growth and deliver robust profit margins. 
Leading Innovation and Product Development Competencies 
In the highly competitive business in which we operate, our tradenames, service marks, and trademarks are important to distinguish our products and services from our competitors. We rely on trade secrets, continuing technological innovations, and licensing arrangements to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also have a portfolio of approximately 1,496 U.S. and foreign patents, and we believe these patents, as well as unpatented research, development, and engineering skills make important contributions to our business. We employ approximately 100 dedicated design and product development professionals across the organization. We are not aware of any facts which would negatively impact our continuing use of any of our tradenames, service marks, trademarks, or patents. By applying our engineering and manufacturing expertise, we have been able to bring to market new and innovative products that maintain product differentiation while targeting affordability for our end consumers. Recent examples of our innovative, market-leading products include:
•Bushnell®, an industry leader in performance optics, released the Fusion X Rangefinding Binoculars and Prime 1800 Laser Rangefinder, both featuring ACTIVSYNC™ technology that automatically transitions readouts from black to red depending on lighting conditions. This year, Bushnell is introducing the Broadhead Laser Rangefinder, the most accurate rangefinder on the market with 0.3-yard accuracy out to 150 yards.
•Federal introduced the 30 Super Carry, the most revolutionary self-defense advancement in nearly 100 years. More than just an all-new cartridge, the compact design represents an entirely new class of ammunition engineered for absolute performance by every measure. With a higher capacity and smaller frame size than the 9mm but with similar muzzle blast, recoil and terminal performance, 30 Super Carry offers a decided advantage.
•For cycling enthusiasts, Bell Helmets announced the all-new XR Spherical helmet, a gravel-focused cycling helmet that offers unmatched protection to riders by using a new outer shell shape and spherical technology. Giro Sport Design, the cycling world’s design leader, released the Eclipse™ Spherical, the fastest road helmet and coolest aero road helmet in the peloton and Merit™ Spherical, a brand new, high-performance trail riding helmet built for fast, flowy trail riding and hard pedaling. All the helmets are built around the added protection of Spherical Technology™ powered by Mips®. 
•Camelbak recently launched new and redesigned mountain bike packs as part of its Spring 2022 collection. These new models include the M.U.L.E.®Evo 12, M.U.L.E.® 12 and Lobo™ 9 packs, as well as the Podium® Flow™ 4hydration belt, which all blend premium eco-friendly materials with mountain bike-specific features to create the perfect bag for any and all cycling adventures.
•For avid golfers, Foresight Sports introduced the GC3 golf launch monitor. The new GC3 features a three-camera system that measures ball and club performance data, both outdoors and indoors, with industry-leading precision.

Proven Manufacturing, Global Sourcing, and Distribution Platform 
We believe that our state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, sourcing and distribution capabilities, and high-quality retail, wholesale and distributor networks allow us to produce, deliver and replenish products in a more efficient and faster manner than our competitors. We believe this speed allows us to better serve the needs of our customers and end consumers and capture market share. We believe the scale and scope of our manufacturing and distribution operations also allows us to be one of the lowest-cost producers in many of our product categories. 
Integrated supply chain management is a core focus of our company. We procure large quantities of raw materials for our manufacturing operations and we leverage negotiating disciplines and production methods with the objective of obtaining the best price and delivery available as well as low-cost conversion of raw materials into finished product. We also source finished product both domestically and internationally for global distribution. We continuously seek to improve our vendor base as well as our in-country support and oversight, and through our integrated supply chain management process we seek to provide year-over-year reductions in product costs. We believe the scope and scale of our sourcing network would be difficult to replicate. 
Our supply chain and logistics infrastructure gives us the ability to serve a broad array of wholesale and retail customers, many of whom rely on us for services such as category management, marketing campaigns, merchandising and inventory replenishment. We believe our strong wholesale and retail relationships and diverse product offering provide us with a unique competitive advantage.
We maintain positive relationships with our retail partners based on trust and professionalism. Our long-standing commitment to our customers, diverse product offering and focus on profitability for both our company and our retail partners have enabled us to gain shelf space and secure premium placement of our products at many major retailers. Our management team interfaces directly with the executives of many of our top retail partners to ensure we are delivering the products our retailers need to meet the demands of the end consumer in the most efficient and profitable manner possible. Furthermore, we believe our scale allows us to leverage our platform to efficiently and profitably service our largest retail customers. For example, we work with our key retail customers to develop marketing and advertising campaigns, provide inventory replenishment support, and organize product category merchandising plans. 
Customers and Marketing 
Our primary customers are retailers and distributors who serve outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters, golfers, cyclists, backyard grillers, campers, athletes, as well as law enforcement and military professionals. Sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, U.S. customers represented approximately 86% of our sales and customers outside of the U.S. represented approximately 14% of our sales. Of our fiscal year 2022 sales, approximately 11% was to law enforcement and military professionals. See Note 18, Operating Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding our customers and geographic information regarding our sales. 
We believe the shooting sports and outdoor recreation industries are led by enthusiasts with a passion for reliable, high-performance products, who rely on a wide variety of media for opinions and recommendations about available products. We use paid, earned, shared, and owned media to enhance the perception of our brands and products and to reinforce our leadership positions in the market. We supplement this exposure with data-driven print and digital advertising that is designed to maximize reach and return on investment. We have an industry-leading digital media presence that includes YouTube and other social media influencers. Our goal is to strengthen our existing consumers' brand loyalty while at the same time reaching new users of our products. 
E-commerce distribution channels, including our brands’ direct-to-consumer websites, represent an increasing portion of our sales across all of our brands. Through our shared E-commerce Center of Excellence, we deploy resources and expertise to all of our brands to help them accelerate the growth of their presence in these channels and respond to changes in consumer shopping behavior.
Quality Assurance 
We maintain a disciplined quality assurance process. We set stringent metrics to drive year-over-year quality improvements. We also have customer call centers, which allow us to collect feedback on our customer service to ensure that our customers and end consumers are satisfied with our products and customer service. 
Table of Contents

Competition 
Competition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features, and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Given the diversity of our product portfolio, we have various significant competitors in each of our markets, including: Nikon and Vortex in the optics market; Hydro Flask, Contigo, Yeti, Osprey, and Nalgene in the hydration systems market; Traeger, Pit Boss, Blackstone, and Lodge in the outdoor cooking market; Schwinn, Bontrager, Smith, Specialized, and Shoei in the bike and snow helmet and accessories markets; Garmin, Nikon and Trackman in the golf electronics market; Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation, Clarus, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf in the ammunition market.
Seasonality
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Sales of our spring and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Our winter sport accessories sales can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather. Sales of our premium hunting accessories are generally highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays.
Regulatory Matters 
Like many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with numerous laws, rules, and regulations, including those involving labor and employment law, environmental law, consumer product safety, data privacy and security, workplace safety, and the export and import of our products. These laws, rules, and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations may be adopted in the future. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable domestic and international laws and regulations. 
Our operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and that forward-looking, proper and cost-effective management of air, land, and water resources is vital to the long-term success of our business. Our environmental policy identifies key objectives for implementing this commitment throughout our operations. We incur operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental requirements and could incur significant additional costs as a result of more stringent requirements that may be promulgated in the future. 
Some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law and similar state laws, can impose liability, without regard to fault, for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites on current or former site owners and operators or parties who sent wastes to such sites. We are conducting investigation and/or remediation activities at certain of our current or former sites where impacts from our historical operations have been identified. Certain of our former subsidiaries have been identified as PRPs, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities at these sites, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect that these potential liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. We could, however, incur substantial additional costs as a result of any additional obligations imposed or conditions identified at these or other sites in the future. 
As a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to various domestic and international consumer product safety laws, such as the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to investigate and deem certain of our products as unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission or similar international agencies could ask a court to require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products. 
While we do not manufacture firearms, we are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution, and sale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, these agencies may limit our growth or business activities, or, in extreme cases, revoke our licenses to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:
•require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business; 
•require labeling and tracking the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition, and certain related products; 
Table of Contents

•regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials; 
•regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition; 
•limit the mail-order sale of ammunition; 
•regulate our employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions; and 
•restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions.
In some cases, the handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products is also regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies oversee the export of certain of our products including ammunition and night vision devices and related technical data, amongst other products. In many instances, we must obtain export authorizations for international shipments. To date, most of our requests for export licenses have been approved. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including preventing us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which regulates the out-bound and in-bound movement of certain of our products, as well as components, parts, and materials used in our manufacturing processes. The agency is authorized to detain and seize shipments, as well as penalize us for failure to comply with applicable regulations. The agency also works closely with the Department of State and the Department of Commerce to protect national security.
Human Capital
People are at the center of our success. We employ approximately 6,900 people spread across multiple states, Puerto Rico, and numerous countries. Our employees lead in the fields of manufacturing, distribution, supply chain management, finance and marketing, among many other talents and specialties. In total, 71% of our employees are in production roles, directly building or distributing world-class outdoor recreation gear and products for our consumers. We have no union-represented employees. We believe that our employee relations generally are good. 
Support for our people drives us at every level. We prioritize employee success and well-being through a strong corporate infrastructure that supports employee engagement, recruiting, professional development, safety, diversity, compensation, and benefits. Our overall commitment and value proposition for our employees begins with our culture and is rooted in the success of our business. When we do well, it enables us to do good for our communities, employees, and charitable partners. 
Employee Engagement 
We are committed to two-way conversations with employees. The Chief Executive Officer and business unit leaders hold regular employee town hall meetings where they provide updates and take employee questions. We regularly update employees with company news, important notices, our philanthropic efforts, and employee stories through many channels, including our internal digital hub (InSite), social media, and our public-facing website. These employee engagement initiatives are especially important across our diverse network which includes multiple locations across the globe and a diverse set of working environments, including production, office, hybrid and remote. To that end, we were pleased to be recognized by Forbes as one of America’s Best Midsize Employers in February 2021 and by Newsweek as one of America’s Most Trusted Companies in March 2022, which demonstrates that our efforts to engage and support employees are well received. 
Recruiting
We place a large emphasis on recruiting talented people to join our company. We prioritize the hiring of smart, energetic and passionate people who not only have the skills we need to thrive in the marketplace, but who also have diverse experiences and perspectives. We have partnered with a variety of organizations to expand our recruiting base so that we can better attract talented veterans, people of color, women and others with backgrounds who would strengthen our business and underlying culture. 
Professional Development 
We take career development seriously. We go to great lengths to make learning and knowledge available to our employees. We deploy a variety of worker training programs on our factory and production floors, including the use of internal leaders and outside safety trainers. Programs such as tuition reimbursement, internships and employee scholarship programs are some of the ways we are investing in our people and their knowledge. We know that these investments are not only good for people, but they are also good for our business. We have seen an increase in internal promotions from all levels of the organization.

Safety 
We operate in a highly-regulated environment in the U.S. and international markets. U.S. federal, state, and local governmental entities, and foreign governments regulate many aspects of our business through product safety standards, laws and regulations.
While employees across our locations work to ensure compliance with the product safety laws and regulations that apply to their products, we have a team of dedicated professionals within the corporate Compliance Department who oversee all aspects of product safety and compliance across the company. Our product safety and compliance personnel have broad and diverse academic and experience credentials and are often sought out by regulators, law enforcement, other industry participants and internal stakeholders to serve as expert consultants and witnesses. This organizational structure, together with robust internal policies and procedures, help ensure that we meet our continuing obligations to regulators and consumers throughout the product life cycles and to keep our employees safe.
On the consumer side, as an outdoor sports and recreation company, we believe that our consumers should be safe when engaging in the outdoor activity of their choice. We partner with a variety of organizations who share these same goals, support policies that advance safety initiatives and use our brand platforms to educate and share best practices for the safe use of our products. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
We continuously look for ways to be a more diverse and inclusive company, from improving our recruiting and marketing efforts to expanding career growth opportunities and external partnerships. During fiscal year 2022, we joined Together Outdoors Coalition (TO), which provides a cross-sector collaborative learning space for organizations, individuals, business leaders, federal agencies, activists, manufacturers and service providers who share a commitment to making the outdoors a more welcoming, safe, and enjoyable place for people of all races, ethnicities, abilities, faiths, identities, genders, orientations, and backgrounds. 
In fiscal year 2021, we began disclosing diversity and inclusion metrics to provide both benchmarks for where we currently stand, and goals for us to strive to meet in the future. Our metrics for the last two fiscal years include:

 | March 31,
Statistic | 2022 | 2021
% of US employees identifying as persons of color (non-white) | 20% | 19% 
% of US Leadership (manager & above) identifying as persons of color* | 10% | 9% 
% of US employees who are female | 28% | 29% 
% of US Leadership (manager & above) who are female | 29% | 27% 
% of US employees who are veterans | 7% | 7% 

*Our fiscal year 2022 metrics expand disclosure to all managers and above who identify as persons of color; the fiscal year 2021 data has been updated accordingly.
Compensation
We believe in equal pay for equal work. We believe pay and compensation should match the talent, experience and skill set of a person, and nothing else. We regularly review our compensation practices and benchmark our performance to others in the industry to ensure we are fulfilling our obligations of fair pay. 
Benefits
Our benefit programs offer comprehensive coverage to help protect our employees’ health, family, and future, and are an important part of the total compensation we provide. We offer both company-provided and optional benefits, including basic life insurance, medical, prescription, telemedicine, and an employee product purchase program. We offer a 401(k) savings plan, with a higher-than-average match for participating employees. 
We expanded our offerings as the COVID-19 pandemic changed the landscape in 2020. We partnered with Care.com to give our employees access and discounts to childcare and other support as they balanced their households during lockdowns and closures. We’ve also expanded our employee assistance program to include additional mental health offerings and access to services to support our employees during the trials and changes brought about from the COVID-19 pandemic.
