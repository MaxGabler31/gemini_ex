ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Klever Marketing, Inc. is engaged in obtaining capital to file and acquire patents, to seek out and to investigate, develop, manufacture and market electronic in-store advertising, directory, loyalty coupon and services which have potential for profit. The Company successfully conducted two in-store demonstrations of its shopping cart technology – the latest being in 2009 with the release of the Giving Cart and its Retailer Chime-Time Awards Programs. Subsequently, in 2010, the Company shifted its business model to mobile technology and has aggressively developed new applications using this technology.
Product Base
 
Following a decade of development of its shopping cart-based electronic advertising technology, which was successful in demonstrating the advantages of electronic distribution and redemption of electronic coupons and promotions, the Company realized that mobile technology, primarily cell phones, had advanced to the level where Klever’s product base could be applied and considerably expanded into an entirely new product line. Accordingly, in 2010, the Company made a dramatic shift into mobile technology. Since that time the Company has made substantial progress on its mobile application development and implementation. The software programming of the consumer KleverShop® 1.0 application was completed and successfully tested in our demonstration store. The retailer and supplier KleverDash® application completed its database and backend programming, complete with a revised graphical user interface, and successfully tested in our demonstration store.
 
Since the initial rollout of KleverShop® 1.0, Klever has expended its applications to include KleverBank®, our online repository for the deposit and redemption of product coupons, and KleverKloud®, which is our cloud-based data repository and promotions hosting environment. Additionally, we introduced the Chime-Time Award Program®, which provides random store merchandise awards to shoppers in the store with notification to all shoppers using KleverShop®. These ‘gamification’ features have been shown to increase smartphone usage while shopping. All of these features are designed to work together.
 
In 2015, the Company’s business efforts were concentrated on two areas: 1) modifying the software to meet retailers’ refined business requirements while introducing some of our phase 2 features, and 2) expanding our contacts within the retail grocery industry. We had completed our second Wholesome Choice Market demonstration test in 2014, and the feedback led us to conclude that to best serve our clients we needed to 1) add a loyalty program with points and 2) develop store branding and license our KleverShop software, allowing markets to brand the application as their own. Following further discussions with our investors, we also decided that now was the time to upgrade our software to an entirely new development platform that would be much more efficient and effective in addressing the desired enhancements and provide for the needed scalability.
 
2016 Software Application Development and Implementation
 
All of these goals were accomplished, and in mid-2016 Klever rolled out its new upgraded software, known as KleverShop 2.0. This new platform is highly efficient, and the new features deliver what our retailers have been asking for. Our coupon options have been expanded. Our user interface provides for complete client branding in order to serve individual retailer needs. We have built our loyalty program designated KleverPoints, which gives retailers the opportunity to award points for various shopping functions that lead to greater basket uplift. Points are awarded for checking in and for redeeming coupons as well as total basket size.
 
Also during 2016, we upgraded our KleverDash® platform. We developed a number of ways to make this tool even more useful to suppliers and retailers, with easier coupon generation, more types of coupons and expanded graphics analytics. Analytics offer the key to expanded use of this module and is a key to retailers gaining increasing market share and basket uplift. Our future work will focus on the consumer engagement uses of our software tools.
 
Our new software platform not only has far better built-in documentation but also allowed us to embed hundreds of software tests that greatly reduce the debugging process. In addition, we purchased a Retalix POS test center to further enable us to eliminate any post-development bugs.
 
We continued to pursue marketing on 3 fronts: 1) Marketing to retail grocers in Southern California to establish a retailer base with established regional grocers, 2) Marketing through retail grocery associations who supply support services and tools to a broad range of retail grocers, and 3) Marketing through software companies who support the Retalix ISS45 POS software throughout the grocery industry.

Towards the end of the year we recognized that customer engagement tools could greatly help us to transition consumers to a digital couponing world. Retail grocers, with their customers making 2-3 trips to the store each week offer a wonderful opportunity to engage their customers with multiple messages responding to their shopping actions or inactions. Klever wants each customer to feel that their local grocery store is “their personal store.” We do this by sending personal messages to them, recognizing them when they are at the store, and most of all offering them promotions and coupons that respond to their particular food interests. And we don’t bother them with products they are not interested in. We also reward them with loyalty points for responding to our promotions and are able to give them special promotions. The Klever Shopping Platform combined with customer engagement tools offer a very powerful resource to retailers and manufacturers, while meeting the needs of consumers.
 
The Company has also conducted a number of system failure tests to be sure we were prepared for network or power failures, overloading of data and a number of possible user errors in operating KleverShop. We also made further enhancements to KleverDash by including a supplier dashboard similar to the retailer dashboard. All of these features we are able to test on our in house POS laboratory.
 
Product Development and Marketing in 2017
 
As stated in last year’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Klever had 4 goals for 2017. Following are the results achieved against these goals:
 

1. | Focus on the eLoyalty aspects of our products. eLoyalty became the focus of our work in 2017. It had become apparent to us that Loyalty was the New Couponing, in that implementation of a full-scale loyalty program would produce greater loyalty than offering product discounts alone. Further, that retailers main objective against the wave of competition from Amazon and Walmart was to offer a level of personalization and loyalty rewards such that shoppers would continue to utilize brick and mortar services. Klever worked diligently with our intended ‘customer engagement’ partner in 2017. Work was interrupted towards yearend and has not resumed.

2. | Obtain additional demonstration stores for or products, leading to revenue operations. Our focus turned away from a demonstration store in 2017 towards online ecommerce businesses who are in need of customer loyalty programs.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Continue to work with cloud-based companies to enhance our access to consumer engagement actions. Work with our cloud-based potential partner was pursued in earnest in 2017. This opportunity still has significant potential
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Expand beyond the grocery industry. The grocery industry has remained resilient against technology, becoming an increasingly difficult industry for any company to break through without significant funding and a great deal of time to overcome the inherent resistance.

Anticipated Business Development in the Next 12 Months
 
2018 is expected to become a defining year for Klever. We have developed technology proven to benefit retailers in the grocery and similar industries but have met reluctance by these customers to accept change. This change to concentrate on customer loyalty seems paramount to us if retail grocers, for example, are to remain competitive with Amazon and Walmart. Nevertheless, our marketing efforts have not yet been successful.
 
Our work efforts with a large cloud marketing company are promising; they understand the underlying importance of loyalty and customer engagement in future retailing – both in traditional and ecommerce businesses, and the understand the need to mine customer purchasing data to determine individual consumer purchasing needs. But Klever is uncertain if the Company will have the resources to sustain our efforts here.
 
In order to provide our shareholders with the best opportunity for growth of the Company and its stock, Klever is also seeking buyout or partnering opportunities with other companies that could produce faster and better results than our current path might produce.
