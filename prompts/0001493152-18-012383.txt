Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Visium Technologies, Inc. is a Florida based company focused on building a global cybersecurity business, by advancing technology and cybersecurity tools and services to support enterprises in protecting their most valuable assets - their data, on their networks, in the cloud, and IoT.
 
Visium is currently engaged in creating a world-class cybersecurity/digital risk management company, with a focus on network security, threat visualization, Internet of Things, (“IoT”), mobile security, pinpoint threat identification, big-data analytics, and smart cities technologies. Our solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks resulting from the increasing adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. In July 2018 Visium entered into a license agreement with George Mason University to commercialize and sell a network assessment and visualization tool that is backed by eight issued patents. This technology allows customers to collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, and take remedial actions.
 
Under the Agreement with George Mason University, the Company is required to make a first commercial sale of a “LICENSED PRODUCT” and/or a first commercial performance of a “LICENSED PROCESS,” as defined in the Agreement, on or before July 30, 2019. The 2019 minimum revenue target for the sale of products and services incorporating the GMRF technology is $100,000. This minimum revenue amount will increase in subsequent years. Also, within 30 days of the Effective date of the Agreement, the Company is required to pay GMRF a non-refundable license issue fee of $20,000. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is required to pay to GMRF a running royalty of 5% of “NET SALES,” as defined in the Agreement.
 
In addition, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Threat Surface Solutions Group, LLC, a company with expertise in Cybersecurity, Testing, Training, and Network Risk Assessment standards and processes. The closing of this acquisition is expected to occur no later than September 1, 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions.
