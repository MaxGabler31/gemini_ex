Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We were founded on the belief that engineered cells will be one of the most important transformations in medicine over the next several decades. The burden of diseases that can be addressed at their root cause through engineered cells is significant. We view engineered cells as having the potential to be as therapeutically disruptive as biologics to clinical practice. Our long-term aspirations are to be able to control or modify any gene in the body, to replace any cell that is damaged or missing, and to markedly improve access to cellular and gene-based medicines. We have brought together an experienced group of scientists, engineers, and company builders and combined them with the necessary technologies to move this vision forward. We are developing ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering platforms to revolutionize treatment across a broad array of therapeutic areas with unmet treatment needs, including oncology, diabetes, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and genetic disorders, among others. Our platform progress, broad capabilities, and strong balance sheet enable us to execute on a broad vision, with a goal of submitting our first INDs in 2022, with the opportunity to submit multiple INDs per year beyond 2022. 
 We believe the time is right to develop engineered cell therapies across a broad range of therapeutic areas. The field has seen initial clinical proof of concept for gene and cell replacement approaches across multiple diseases, including cancer and certain genetic disorders, through the application of adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapies, autologous CAR T cell therapies, and autologous and allogeneic grafts/transplants. While such existing approaches have limitations, they provide evidence that a broad range of ex vivo and in vivo engineered cells can have transformative clinical potential in at least a subset of patients. Substantial progress in the understanding of genetics, gene editing, gene control, protein engineering, stem cell biology, immunology, process analytics, and computational biology have converged to create an opportunity to markedly increase the breadth and depth of the potential impact of genetic and cellular medicines. 
 We are seeking to overcome these existing limitations of gene and cell therapy through our ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering platforms, both of which may facilitate the development of therapies that can transform the lives of patients by repairing cells in the body when possible and replacing them when needed. For ex vivo therapies, where diseased cells are damaged or missing entirely and an effective therapy needs to replace the entire cell, a successful therapeutic requires large-scale manufacturing of cells that engraft, function, and persist in the body. Of these, we view persistence as the greatest limitation to dramatically expanding the impact of this class of therapeutics. We believe that product candidates developed with our ex vivo cell engineering platform, which utilizes hypoimmune allogeneic cells that can “hide” from the patient’s immune system, can address this fundamental limitation and unlock a wave of disruptive therapeutics. For in vivo therapies, where the desire is to repair and control genes in the body, a successful product candidate requires both gene modification and in vivo delivery of the therapeutic payload. Of these, we view effective in vivo delivery as the greatest limitation to dramatically expanding the impact of this class of therapeutics. To this end, our initial focus is on cell-specific delivery as well as increasing the diversity and size of payloads.
 We believe we have the potential to develop transformative engineered cells as medicines because of our people and our capabilities:

 Our capabilities enable us to take a comprehensive approach to the most important and difficult aspects of engineering cells. We are pursuing ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering and can leverage the synergistic proficiencies required to succeed in both approaches. We believe we can capitalize on the shared expertise and infrastructure between the platforms to maximize the potential success and the reach of our transformative therapies. We have built deep internal capabilities across a wide range of areas focused on solving the most critical limitations in engineering cells including: 
  
• | Gene Delivery. We believe our delivery technologies have broad potential, with both near-term and long-term applications across a number of indications.

 Our ex vivo and in vivo Cell Engineering Platforms 
 The advent of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s ushered in a new era of therapeutics, enabling the synthetic manufacture of human protein therapies at scale for the first time. However, the critical inflection point occurred when key technological advancements eventually enabled the broad development of monoclonal antibodies with suitable therapeutic properties. These advancements, combined with progress in understanding disease biology, allowed biologics to become the second largest therapeutic class. We believe engineered cells are at a similar inflection point, with key recent technological advancements providing the potential for the broad applicability of this therapeutic class. 
 Ex vivo cell engineering 
 Engineering cells ex vivo requires the ability to engineer and manufacture cells at scale and then deliver them to the patient, so that they engraft, function appropriately, and have the necessary persistence in the body. Our goal for ex vivo cell engineering is to replace any cell in the body with cells that engraft, function, and persist over time, and to manufacture those cells cost-effectively at scale. Our ex vivo cell engineering platform utilizes our hypoimmune technology to create cells that can “hide” from the patient’s immune system to enable persistence of allogeneic cells. We are striving to make therapies utilizing pluripotent stem cells with our hypoimmune genetic modifications as the starting material, which we then differentiate into a specific cell type, such as a pancreatic beta cell, before treating the patient. Additionally, for cell types for which effective differentiation protocols from a stem cell have not yet been developed, such as T cells, instead of starting from a pluripotent stem cell, we can utilize a fully differentiated allogeneic cell, 
 6

sourced from a donor, as the starting material to which we then apply our hypoimmune genetic modifications. Our goal is to manufacture genetically modified cells that are capable of both replacing the missing cell and evading the patient’s immune system. We are now applying our technologies to make cell products for the treatment of multiple diseases. 
 In vivo cell engineering 
 Engineering cells in vivo requires the development of both an appropriate delivery vector as well as a payload to effectively modify the cell. Our goal for in vivo cell engineering is to repair and control the genes of any cell in the body. The ultimate aim is to achieve the delivery of any payload, to any cell, in a specific and repeatable way. Our in vivo cell engineering platform harnesses fusogen technology, which targets cell surface receptors, and thereby can enable cell specific delivery for a meaningful number of different cell types. Using our fusogen technology, we have shown in preclinical studies that we can specifically target numerous cell surface receptors that, when combined with delivery vehicles to form fusosomes, allow cell-specific delivery across multiple different cell types. 
 Our Portfolio Strategy 
 We believe the potential applications of our platforms are vast. To prioritize programs for our ex vivo and in vivo engineering pipeline we have used the following strategies: 
  
• | minimize biology risk where there is platform risk, or in other words, prioritize opportunities where success with our platform should lead to success in addressing the underlying disease;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prioritize program investments in diseases where the strengths of our ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering platforms can address the key limitations of existing therapeutic approaches;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | focus on conditions of high unmet need, including the most grievous diseases; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prioritize efforts where success in one area begets success in others.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Pipeline 
 We are developing a broad pipeline of product candidates focused on creating transformative ex vivo and in vivo engineered cell therapies across a range of therapeutic areas. We are in the early stages of development across a broad pipeline of product candidates, all of which are currently in the preclinical stage of development and are summarized below: 
 

Each of our initial programs provides the potential for meaningful standalone value while also supporting our potential ability to further exploit our platforms into broadly applicable medicines. 
 
Our most advanced hypoimmune product candidate is SC291, a CD19-directed allogeneic CAR T program for NHL, CLL, and ALL. This program is designed to address the major limitation of existing allogenic CAR T cell therapies: evasion of host versus 
 7

graft responses (HvGR), which occurs when a patient’s immune system kills the transplanted T cells, limiting the potential benefit of the therapy. One approach to avoid HvGR has been to effectively eliminate a patient’s immune system for a short period using chemotherapy, which puts the patient at risk for severe infections. Further, the patient’s immune system will inevitably recover, which will lead to the immune system eliminating the CAR T cells, limiting the effectiveness of the therapy. Our hypoimmune technology is designed to hide cells from the patient’s immune system, giving our allogeneic CAR T cell program the potential to create medicines that persist longer in patients and avoid the risks associated with higher doses of chemotherapy. Our goal is to submit an IND for SC291 in 2022, and initial clinical success would unlock meaningful standalone value in the development of SC291 in NHL/CLL/ALL which has the potential to address scalability challenges of autologous therapies. Additionally, this initial clinical success would support and validate the expansion of our allogenic CAR T efforts, which include a CD22-targeting allogeneic CAR T which could be combined with targeting CD19 (SC276) and offers the potential benefit of higher and more durable complete response rates, and a BCMA directed CAR T (SC255) in multiple myeloma. Furthermore, initial clinical success would also support the validation of the hypoimmune platform overall, which is being actively deployed internally across a number of other therapeutic areas beyond oncology. 
 
Our next most advanced hypoimmune product candidate is SC451, PSC-derived pancreatic beta cells for the treatment of diabetes, with an initial focus on Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Almost 1.6 million people in the United States, and 2.4 million in Europe have T1DM. T1DM is a disease in which a patient’s immune system attacks and kills pancreatic beta cells, leading to complete loss of insulin production in affected individuals. Patients need to take multiple insulin injections every day for life, and, while insulin has a profoundly positive impact on patients, people with T1DM have approximately 15 years shorter life expectancies than people without diabetes and are consistently at risk for complications such as coma, stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and blindness from poorly controlled blood glucose. We and our collaborators have shown that we can develop high quality beta cells that, when transplanted, normalize blood glucose and cure diabetes in animal models. We have also shown that our hypoimmune cells induce no systemic immune response, even in NHPs with a pre-existing immune response to non-hypoimmune cells. As a result, we believe our stem cell derived hypoimmune pancreatic cells have the potential to create a disruptive treatment for T1DM, offering patients life-long normal blood glucose without immunosuppression. We are working through the process development and IND-enabling studies to allow for an IND submission for SC451 as early as 2023.
 
Our most advanced fusosome product candidate is SG295, which targets CD19+ cancer cells, including NHL, CLL, and ALL. This program provides us with an opportunity to develop potential product candidates to expand access to CAR T cell therapy to many more patients in need. In addition, we believe the ability to deliver a payload encoding a CAR to a T cell without meaningful ex vivo manipulation has the potential to improve effectiveness over ex vivo manufactured CAR T cell products. These approaches should result in the generation of therapeutically active CAR T cells without the complexities and delays associated with the process of T cell collection and ex vivo manufacturing. Furthermore, the ex vivo expansion in the presence of high cytokine concentrations, while necessary for the manufacture of approved CAR T cell products, also contributes to marked changes in T cell quality that may not be therapeutically beneficial. The generation of a CAR T cell within the natural physiological environment in vivo has the potential to improve the quality of the CAR T cell generated, potentially improving both efficacy and the side effect profile. Finally, the effectiveness of ex vivo manufactured CAR T cells is dependent on the administration of a lymphodepleting preparative regimen prior to infusion to facilitate expansion of the CAR T cell product, which can have meaningful adverse safety implications. We do not expect to need a lymphodepleting regimen prior to in vivo delivery of the CAR gene, as our goal is to expose our fusosomes to as many T cells in the body as possible. Our goal is to submit an IND for SG295 in 2022 and initial clinical success would unlock meaningful standalone value in the development of SG295 in NHL/CLL/ALL Additionally, this initial clinical success would support and validate the expansion of our in vivo CAR T efforts and support the validation of our fusosome platform overall, which is being actively deployed internally across a number of other therapeutic areas beyond oncology with the goal of targeted delivery of DNA and gene editing machinery to specific cells in vivo.
Our ex vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 Overview 
 Ex vivo cell engineering aims to treat human disease by engrafting new cells to replace diseased cells that are damaged or missing in patients. Historically there have been four key challenges to ex vivo cell engineering: 
  
• | engraftment of the right cell in the right environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | appropriate function of the cells, necessitating an understanding of and ability to produce the desired cell phenotype;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | persistence of the cells in the host, particularly by overcoming immune rejection; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing the desired cell in the quantities required.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Our ex vivo cell engineering platform seeks to address these four challenges and is focused on engineering hypoimmune cells that engraft, function, and persist in patients by evading immune rejection. These are derived from cell sources that are scalable and we believe that continued progress with this platform has the potential to create broad access for patients. 
 Our Approach to Building our ex vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 We have approached the development of our ex vivo cell engineering platform by investing in solutions to address the key challenges outlined above: 
  
• | Stem cell and disease biology. We believe that it is critical to have expertise in the developmental biology of stem cell differentiation and a deep understanding of the desired cell phenotype biology of stem cell differentiation in order to generate cells that function appropriately, as well as a deep understanding of the desired cell phenotype. The latter requires expertise in normal and disease biology. Furthermore, clinical understanding of disease pathology and transplant medicine is required to determine how to engraft the right cell in the right environment. Each of our programs is led by a prominent clinician-scientist with deep expertise in both cell therapy and disease biology, including Dr. Terry Fry, our Senior Vice President, Head of T Cell Therapeutics, for T cells, Dr. Steve Goldman, our Senior Vice President, Head of CNS Therapy, for glial cells, and Dr. Chuck Murry, our Senior Vice President, Head of Cardiometabolic Cell Therapy, for cardiomyocytes and beta cells.

• | Immunology and gene modification. We believe that a deep understanding of the immunological response to engineered cells is essential to unlocking the potential of ex vivo therapies. This effort is led by Dr. Sonja Schrepfer, our Senior Vice President, Head of Hypoimmune Platform, and draws from decades of research. We have licensed technologies from University of California San Francisco, Harvard University, Washington University, and others to enable this effort. In addition, in order to create successful hypoimmune cells, we are investing in building out our gene editing, modification, and insertion capabilities, led by Dr. Ed Rebar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing. We are investing proactively in process development, including process optimization and scale up, analytical development, CMC regulatory, supply chain, quality, and other manufacturing sciences in order to develop processes that can enable scalable manufacturing of cell therapies and broad patient access. We have also built a pilot manufacturing plant in South San Francisco, California and entered into a long-term lease agreement for a facility in Fremont, California, where we intend to build our own clinical trial and commercial Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing capabilities. We are also investing to access high quality donor-derived T cells and GMP-grade pluripotent stem cell lines for our programs. These manufacturing efforts are led by Dr. Stacey Ma, our Executive Vice President, Technical Operations.

 Our Approach to Building our ex vivo Cell Engineering Portfolio 
 We have prioritized cell types for our programs where: 
  
• | high unmet need can be addressed by cell replacement;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | existing proof of concept in humans and/or animal models demonstrates that cell transplantation should have a clinical benefit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evidence exists that the cell type can be successfully differentiated from pluripotent stem cells and that such stem cell-derived cells can function appropriately in vivo;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there has been the ability to hire or partner with one of the world experts in the field to ensure our programs are rooted in a deep understanding of the underlying cell and disease biology; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evading immune system rejection via the hypoimmune technology is either not required initially, but would be disruptive over time (such as cardiomyocytes) or is the critical missing element to developing a cell therapy (such as beta cells).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on this prioritization, we are initially focused on four cell types: T Cells, Beta cells, GPCs, and Cardiomyocytes.
Historical context of ex vivo therapy 
 Blood transfusions have been a standard treatment for many patients for over 100 years. The first successful kidney transplant occurred in 1954, followed by the first successful heart transplant in 1967, demonstrating the transformative clinical potential of replacing damaged or missing cells in the body. Surgical enhancements have improved the success of engraftment, but lack of organ access, a complex surgical procedure, and immune rejection of the donated organs have limited the impact of these procedures. 
 9

Progress in immunosuppressive regimens, such as the development of cyclosporine, has improved organ survival rates. However, substantial side effects and the fact that many patients are ineligible or non-compliant have reduced their impact.
Ultimately, the field has looked for a scalable source of therapeutic cells that can be accessed broadly at a manageable cost, as well as cells that can evade immune rejection without immunosuppression. The advent of stem cell technology and subsequent improvements in methods to generate functional differentiated cells at scale have the potential to address the shortage of donor tissues and organs. In addition, over the past decade a deeper understanding of the immunology of host versus graft responses, coupled with novel techniques to manipulate the immunological profile of cells via gene editing, have raised the prospect that ex vivo engineered cells can significantly benefit patients without the requirement for significant immunosuppression. 
 Sources of allogeneic cells 
 There are three main potential sources of allogeneic cells, or cells that do not originate from the patient, and therefore have the potential to be manufactured and supplied at scale. These are embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPSCs, and donor-derived cells. Our portfolio currently reflects a mix of sources, with the ambition of transitioning primarily to iPSCs over time. 
 Embryonic Stem Cells 
 The recognition that every cell in the body originates from a zygote, or fertilized egg, led to the research and ultimate discovery of human ESCs, with the derivation of the first human ESC line in 1998. ESCs are pluripotent stem cells which can potentially differentiate into any cell type and are derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst or pre-implantation stage embryo. They are typically cultured in vitro and grown through cycles of cell division, known as passages, until a line of cells is established that can proliferate without differentiating, and retain their pluripotency while remaining well characterized, including free from potentially deleterious genetic mutations. Because pluripotent stem cells can divide indefinitely without exhaustion, an ESC line can be used to generate cell banks, consisting of large numbers of well-characterized vials of cells, that can be frozen and stored for future use. 
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells 
 The discovery that mature, differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to be the equivalent of an ESC and capable of generating any cell type in the body, has led to the research and ultimate development of human iPSCs, providing an alternative option as a source of stem cells for use in ex vivo engineered cells. A key scientific step was the breakthrough in 2006 demonstrating that mature cells could be reprogrammed via the expression of a small number of genes to result in pluripotent cells These iPSCs have similar potential to ESCs to be used as an indefinitely renewable cell bank for manufacturing of cell-based therapies. 
Donor-Derived Allogeneic Cells 
 Another source of cells, which we utilize in our T cell program, comes from mature donor-derived allogeneic cells. While these cells are neither pluripotent nor from an infinitely renewable source, T cells can be obtained as mature cells from human donors at scale. The use of donor-derived cells for our T cell program should allow us to rapidly advance the program towards the clinic with the implementation of our hypoimmune technology. 
Approach to Sources of Allogeneic Cells 
 We are focused on iPSCs as the starting material for our programs, which offers regulatory and cultural advantages to ESCs, and scale and product consistency advantages to donor-derived allogeneic cells. Our portfolio currently reflects a mix of sources, which is primarily driven by historical factors as well as current better characterization of genomic stability through differentiation. Our ambition is to transition primarily to iPSCs over time. 
 Crucial aspects of developing allogeneic cells from any source include the thorough characterization of the cells, a comprehensive understanding of the global regulatory environment, and an ability to maintain cells under the required conditions, such as current GMP (cGMP), at various stages of the manufacturing processes. We believe our early investment in building capabilities in the science and manufacturing of these cells will increase our likelihood of success. This investment is anticipated to 
 10

yield sources of cells suitable for the global clinical development and commercialization of ex vivo engineered cells for a broad patient population, in line with our vision to democratize access. 
 Background on Immunological Barriers to ex vivo Therapies and Current Limitations 
 Starting with studies in renal transplantation in the early 1900s, it became clear that there were immunological factors preventing successful transplantation. Initially, it was suspected to be mediated by an antibody response, but in the 1950s it was discovered that cell-mediated immune pathways also play a critical role in transplant rejection. 
 Further studies established T cells as playing a key role in the host immune response to transplant. T cells belong to the “adaptive” immune system, recognizing and eliminating “non-self” cells via recognition of differences in cell-surface proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus. There are two types of MHC molecules: MHC class I, expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells, and MHC class II, expressed constitutively on professional antigen presenting cells (APC), including macrophages and dendritic cells. Expression of MHC class II is also induced in many additional cells in the context of inflammation. MHC class I molecules typically display peptides on the cell surface from degraded intracellular proteins. Cells display peptides from normal “self” proteins on MHC class I, which typically will not activate an immune response due to a process called tolerance, where the body recognizes these peptides as “self”. However, if a cell displays a peptide from a foreign or mutated protein on MHC class I, for example as a result of a protein mutation, it may result in the activation of a cytotoxic T cell response specific to the peptide-MHC complex via the T cell receptor (TCR) on the T cell surface. The activated T cell then eliminates the cell. MHC class II molecules typically display peptides derived from phagocytosis of extracellular proteins on the surface of APCs. These peptide-MHC complexes interact with TCRs on helper T cells, such as CD4+ T cells, resulting in a downstream cellular and humoral immune response. The humoral immune response leads to antibody production against foreign proteins. In allogeneic transplants, the cellular and humoral processes can recognize proteins from the donor as “foreign”, resulting in an immune response to the transplant including potential elimination of the transplanted cells. In the allogeneic setting, MHC proteins can be highly immunogenic due to their inherent polymorphism, increasing the risk of the recognition of transplants as “foreign”. This underlies the basis for MHC typing and matching to assess and reduce the risk of organ transplant rejection. 
 Many groups have attempted to engineer cells that can evade the adaptive immune system, typically by downregulating or eliminating expression of MHC molecules on the surface of cells. While this can reduce the adaptive immune response to donor cells, the human immune system has evolved so that parts of the innate immune system will recognize cells missing MHC molecules and eliminate them. For example, natural killer (NK) cells express receptors known as inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (inhibitory KIRs). KIRs recognize self MHC class I molecules on the surface of cells and provide inhibitory signals to the NK cells to prevent their activation. Cells missing MHC class I molecules are correspondingly eliminated by NK cells because of the lack of inhibitory KIR signaling and a resulting cytolytic activation. Known as the “missing self-hypothesis,” this important redundancy in immunology enables the elimination of virally infected or transformed cells that have downregulated MHC class I, but also has complicated the development of allogeneic cells as broadly applicable therapeutics. Our hypoimmune technology seeks to engineer cells to avoid immune rejection by addressing both the adaptive and innate immune response. 
 There are three key strategies that have been utilized to date to overcome immune rejection, with limited success: 
  
• | Immune Suppression. Cyclosporine and other molecules that suppress T cell responses are commonly used, and many patients have been helped by the approaches in areas such as an organ transplantation. However, immune suppression often leads to significant systemic side effects, including a decreased ability to fight-off infections, increased susceptibility to cancer, and a wide variety of organ toxicities. Furthermore, patients typically require these on a lifelong basis, and any disruption in immunosuppression can rapidly trigger rejection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Matching HLA Type. A second approach to overcoming immune rejection is to find a donor with a matched HLA type. HLA stands for human leukocyte antigen which, in humans, is a synonym for MHC. This approach addresses the root of the mechanism that the immune system uses to identify “non-self” cells and has achieved some success. Finding a matched donor, however, can be difficult and is usually limited to close relatives who are willing and able to donate. While some have advocated for creating large banks of cells that match a wide variety of HLA types, even with fully matched HLA class I and class II donors and recipients, there is a need for at least some immune suppression due to the presence of numerous minor antigen mismatches.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Autologous Approaches. More recently, researchers have pursued autologous approaches, where a patient’s own cells are modified and introduced back as a graft. These cells may avoid immune rejection as they would be recognized as “self.” Autologous approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in certain diseases, such as autologous CAR Ts for hematological malignancies, but these are limited in their adoption due to manufacturing cost and complexity. Furthermore, autologous approaches are generally limited to cells that exist in the patient in suspension, such as blood cells, and they cannot be applied to treat acute illnesses, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, due to the time it takes to prepare these cells for administration.

Our Solution – Hypoimmune Technology 
 To address the challenge of immune rejection with allogeneic cell transplantation, we are developing our hypoimmune technology, utilizing gene modification to introduce permanent changes to the cells. We are applying the hypoimmune technology to both iPSCs, which can then be differentiated into multiple cell types, and to donor-derived allogeneic T cells, which has the goal of making potent CAR T cells at scale. Our goal with this technology is to transplant allogeneic cells into patients without the need for systemic immune suppression. We believe that enabling this capability has the potential to enable ex vivo engineered cells to become an important therapeutic modality alongside small molecules, protein biologics, and in vivo engineered cells. 
 Some of our scientific founders, including Dr. Sonja Schrepfer, our Senior Vice President, Head of Hypoimmune Platform, and their collaborators have worked on creating hypoimmune cells for well over a decade. A key insight was focusing on the phenomenon of fetomaternal tolerance during pregnancy. The fetus, despite having half its genetic material from the father, is not rejected by the mother’s immune system. However, after birth, few if any children would qualify as a matched donor for a cell or organ transplant for their mother. These scientists categorized the differences of the maternal-fetal border and systematically tested them to understand which, if any, of these were most important to immune evasion. They have tested these changes in both in vitro and in vivo animal models. 
 Designing Hypoimmune Cells 
 Our goal is to create a universal cell that is able to evade immune detection, regardless of cell type or transplant location. Our first-generation technology, which is progressing through late-stage animal confirmatory studies, combines the three gene modifications below to hide these cells from the host immune system: 

• | disruption of MHC class I expression;
--+--------------------------------------


• | disruption of MHC class II expression; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | overexpression of CD47, a protein that hides cells from the innate immune system, including macrophages and NK cells.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Development of Hypoimmune Cells 
 We and our licensors have carried out a series of experiments in various model systems of increasing immunological complexity. These included (i) transplanting undifferentiated mouse hypoimmune iPSCs- into MHC mismatched allogeneic mice, (ii) transplanting mouse hypoimmune iPSC-derived differentiated cells, such as endothelial cells, into MHC mismatched allogeneic mice, (iii) transplanting human hypoimmune iPSCs into MHC mismatched humanized allogeneic mice; and (iv) transplanting human hypoimmune iPSCs into non-human primates (NHPs). We are currently carrying out experiments transplanting NHP hypoimmune iPSC cells into NHPs as well as transplanting NHP hypoimmune iPSC-derived differentiated cells, such as cardiomyocytes, into allogeneic NHPs. 
 Each mouse experiment evaluated: 
  
• | whether hypoimmune cells can be successfully transplanted into the recipient without the need for immunosuppression and without eliciting an immune response; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | whether differentiated cells derived from our hypoimmune cells were successfully engrafted in the recipient without needing immunosuppression and without eliciting an immune response.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are investigating both human iPSCs in NHPs as well as NHP iPSCs in NHPs, as we want insights into how the NHP immune system reacts to each of these species. We have largely completed the study of human iPSCs and have early results from the NHP hypoimmune iPSC transplantation experiments. We are encouraged by data to date across species, with the NHP immune system most closely resembling the human immune system, representing the strictest test outside of testing these cells in humans. We are evaluating both iPSCs as well as differentiated cells transplanted into the microenvironment we intend to target in humans. Based on the results of these NHP studies, we expect to test these hypoimmune cells in humans as a next step. 
 Mouse iPSC-derived hypoimmune cells transplanted into MHC mismatched allogeneic mouse 
 Mouse hypoimmune iPSCs transplanted into an MHC mismatched allogeneic mouse were protected from the mouse immune system, and no evidence was seen of either adaptive or innate immune system activation. The control arm transplanted non-edited mouse iPSCs into MHC mismatched allogeneic mice, and, as expected, these non-edited mouse iPSCs were rapidly rejected by the recipient’s immune system with a robust adaptive immune response. In another experiment, the genes that code for MHC class I and MHC class II expression were knocked out. These modifications protected the cells from the recipient mouse’s adaptive immune 
 12

system, but NK cells rapidly killed the transplanted cells. These data highlight the importance of making all three gene modifications in order to protect cells from the immune system with an allogeneic transplant. 
 Next, to ensure that hypoimmune gene modifications protected differentiated cells and that these modifications did not impact the ability of iPSCs to differentiate into various cell types, commonly referred to as pluripotency, it was tested whether the hypoimmune iPSCs cells could be differentiate into three different cell types, function in vivo, and evade the host immune system. The three cell types were cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. It was observed that hypoimmune iPSCs could successfully differentiate into all three cell types, the cells functioned in the mouse, and the transplanted cells survived for the full standard observation period with no evidence of immune system activations despite any immune suppression. Differentiated cells derived from non-edited iPSC cells led to immune activation in the host mouse, and they did not survive. These data provide initial proof of concept that iPSCs can be genetically modified, and differentiated into target cells that can engraft, function, and evade the recipient’s immune system following transportation. 
 Human iPSC-derived hypoimmune cells transplanted into MHC mismatched allogeneic humanized mouse 
 Having demonstrated the ability of mouse iPSC-derived hypoimmune cells to satisfy each of three testing criteria, the experiments were advanced to evaluate human hypoimmune cells. This was evaluated using a “humanized” mouse system, generated by grafting a functioning human immune system in place of the mouse immune system. 
 In addition to evaluating the three primary criteria, the ability to successfully engineer human hypoimmune cells from human iPSCs and whether differentiated cells derived from human hypoimmune cells retain biological function were also evaluated. 
 Creating Hypoimmune Therapeutic Cells from Human iPSCs 
 
Our hypoimmune technology combines the following three gene modifications to hide cells from the host immune system: Disruption of MHC class I and class II expression (which inactivates adaptive immune responses), and overexpression of CD47 (which hides cells from the innate immune system, including macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells). Pluripotent stem cells from healthy donors are used as the starting material and are then genetically modified with the hypoimmune edits. These edited cells are then differentiated into cell types of therapeutic interest, which are administered to the patient as “off the shelf” therapies. 
 First, the foregoing three edits were replicated in human iPSCs to engineer a human hypoimmune cell line that had comparable properties to the mouse hypoimmune cells in vitro. Next, non-edited human iPSCs were transplanted into MHC mismatched humanized mice. It was observed that these non-edited human iPSCs were rapidly rejected. Human hypoimmune cells were then transplanted into MHC mismatched humanized mice. It was observed that the human hypoimmune cells survived the full length of the experiment and failed to elicit any type of immune response. From this, it was concluded that, in humanized mice, the human 
 13

hypoimmune cells can evade the immune system. Pluripotency of human hypoimmune cells was confirmed by differentiation into two different cell types, endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. These differentiated cells exhibited the characteristics of normal endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. Finally, to test whether these the differentiated cell types derived from human hypoimmune cells continue to evade the immune system, the differentiated cells were transplanted into humanized mice, and the transplanted cells survived for the full standard observation period. In contrast, differentiated cells derived from non-edited human iPSC cells did not survive after being transplanted, as anticipated. It was also observed that the hypoimmune endothelial cells formed primitive vasculature with active blood flow and the hypoimmune cardiomyocyte cells matured into functional-looking heart cells.

Absence of T and B Cell Activation Following Transplantation of Hypoimmune-Edited Human iPSCs into Mismatched Humanized Mice 
 
Left panels: T cell activation was measured by EliSpot counts for interferon-gamma production. Immune cells from mice that received wild type (wt) iPSC grafts show a brisk interferon response when tested against allogeneic wt iPSC grafts. In contrast, immune cells from mice that received hypoimmune-edited (MHC class I/II disruption, CD47 tg) cells show only minimal interferon production when exposed to allogeneic hypoimmune cells, comparable to background frequency in non-immunized mice. Right panels: B cell activation was measured by antibody binding to each cell type, shown as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Wild type cells exhibit significant antibody binding when incubated with serum from mice that received wt cells. In contrast, hypoimmune-edited cells show only background levels of binding when treated with serum from mice that received hypoimmune-edited cells.

 CD47 is Required to Protect Hypoimmune-Edited Cells from Killing by Human NK Cells 
 
Human iPSCs were differentiated into endothelial cells (hiECs) and plated as a monolayer in a multielectrode system. After exposure to NK cells, monolayer viability was measured electrical impedance, indicated here as normalized cell index. As expected, wt cells were not killed by NK cells. In contrast, cells lacking MHC class I and II (but not expressing CD47 tg; MHC class I/II disruption) were rapidly killed. Addition of CD47 tg prevented killing by NK cells. A blocking antibody to CD47 abolished protection from NK cells, affirming the importance of CD47 overexpression in protection from innate immune cell killing. From Deuse et al, Nature Biotechnology 2019.

Survival of Hypoimmune-Edited Human iPSC Grafts in MHC-Mismatched Humanized Mice 
 
Wild type (wt) and hypoimmune-edited (MHC class I/II disruption CD47 tg) iPSCs were engineered to express firefly luciferase before transplantation. Emission of light was used as an index of graft cell viability. Sequential light emission scans from the same representative animal receiving wt cells show progressive loss of graft viability, indicating graft rejection, confirmed quantitatively in the line tracings below. In contrast, mice receiving hypoimmune-edited cells show graft expansion over the course of the experiment, indicating immune evasion. From Deuse et al, Nature Biotechnology 2019. 
 NHP hypoimmune cells transplanted into NHPs 
 To evaluate immune evasion properties of the hypoimmune cells, we have tested the immune response to and survival of hypoimmune iPSCs from NHPs by transplantation into an allogeneic NHP recipient without immunosuppression. 
 
Design for Allogeneic Study Involving Wild Type (Unmodified) and Hypoimmune NHP iPSC Delivery to NHPs 
 

The study involved a randomized group of eight NHPs distributed into two cohorts of four NHPs each. The first cohort received an initial intramuscular injection of non-edited NHP iPSCs and a second injection of NHP hypoimmune cells at six weeks (i.e., a crossover design). The second cohort received an initial injection of NHP hypoimmune cells, which allowed assessment of immune 
 16

evasion in a naïve recipient. This cohort also received a second injection of non-edited NHP iPSCs, which, with a view towards modeling certain aspects of autoimmune disease, enabled assessment of the impact of injecting hypoimmune cells into an NHP with a pre-existing immune response to non-edited cells. No immunosuppression was administered to any of the animals in the study.
 
Allogeneic Hypoimmune iPSC Survive in vivo in NHPs with an Intact Immune System 
 


Upper panel: Unmodified wild type (wt) NHP iPSCs (Group 1 top row) or hypoimmune NHP iPSCs (Group 2 bottom row) were introduced via intramuscular injection into allogeneic NHPs. Unmodified NHP iPSCs are undetectable in recipient NHPs by week 3 while hypoimmune NHP iPSCs introduced into naïve NHPs were viable and detectable for 16 weeks post injection. After 6 weeks of the initial injection, NHPs were injected with the cross-over cell type (group 1 with hypoimmune NHP iPSCs and group 2 with wild type iPSCs). In these crossover experiments, hypoimmune NHP iPSCs survived even when the NHP had been exposed to unmodified iPSCs. Unmodified cells injected into NHPs previously injected with hypoimmune iPSCs were rapidly killed with no observable impact on the hypoimmune NHP iPSCs that continued to remain viable. Data are representative for four NHPs receiving HIP iPSCs and wt iPSCs.
  Lower panel:  iPSC survival is followed over time in vivo using bioluminescence  imaging (BLI).

Absence of T Cell, B Cell, or NK Cell Responses Following the First Delivery and Crossover of Hypoimmune NHP iPSCs into NHPs 
 

Upper panel: Immune cells from animals receiving hypoimmune iPSCs showed no response when exposed to hypoimmune iPSCs in vitro (Row 1) in contrast to wt iPSCs (Row 2). Lower panel: Neither unmodified nor hypoimmune-edited cells were susceptible to killing by natural killer (NK) cells, indicating protection from the “missing self” signal. Data above are collected from four NHPs in each experimental arm. 
 NHP hypoimmune cells grafted into NHPs elicited no detectable systemic immune responses, including no T cell activation and no antibody formation. Innate immune responses mediated by macrophages and NK cells were also undetectable. The transplanted hypoimmune cells were alive and detectable for the duration of the study in these allogeneic recipients (Study duration was 16 weeks for 2/4 NHPs and 8 weeks for 2/4 NHPs. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of prolonged graft survival in an allogeneic transplant setting without immunosuppression in NHPs. In contrast, systemic immune responses from T cells as well as IgM and IgG antibodies were generated to iPSCs without the hypoimmune edits, and the cells were rapidly rejected within two to three weeks. 
 In the crossover portion of this experiment, injection of NHP hypoimmune cells into NHPs that had previously received non-edited NHPs again elicited no systemic responses as tested in assays for T cell or antibody responses. Similarly, macrophage and NK responses could not be detected. Correspondingly, these cells survived for the full eight weeks that they were monitored suggesting that pre-existing immunity to non-edited human iPSCs had no impact on hypoimmune cell survival. By contrast, in the NHPs that had previously been injected with the hypoimmune cells, the non-edited NHP cells elicited both T cell and antibody responses against the non-edited cells. Notably, these non-edited cells were rapidly rejected (in one to two weeks) in the recipient even as the previously injected hypoimmune cells continued to be viable in the other leg of the NHP. These results provide confirmation that the survival of the hypoimmune allo-graft was not an artifact of an impaired immune system or immune response in the recipient NHP. They also suggest that these hypoimmune cells have the potential for immune evasion even the context of a new immune response toward cells without these edits. 
 18

In light of our preclinical data to date, we believe our hypoimmune technology has the potential to address the most fundamental limitation of ex vivo therapies, persistence, and thereby unlock waves of potentially disruptive therapies across a variety of cell types. 
 Safety Switch for Hypoimmune Cells 
 We are actively investigating approaches to control hypoimmune cells after administration into the patient. If necessary, the aim of these “safety switches” would be to provide a mechanism to eliminate hypoimmune cells within the body in a targeted fashion, in scenarios where the cells are not in a location where physical removal is viable. Such a safety switch would be beneficial to mitigate the potential risk of a hypoimmune cell becoming infected with a virus or undergoing oncogenic transformation, in light of the immune evasion modifications to these cells. 
 One approach we are exploring as a safety switch is to re-sensitize the hypoimmune cells to innate cell killing via administration of a blocking anti-CD47 antibody. We have tested the effectiveness of this approach in iPSCs and teratomas (a particular tumor formed by pluripotent cells with histological features from all three germ layers), both bearing the hypoimmune modifications. Using hypoimmune NHP iPSCs we observed in vitro that the addition of an anti-CD47 antibody binds to and blocks CD47 expressed in the hypoimmune cells and restores the sensitivity to the missing-self killing response mediated by NK cells. We also assessed this strategy in mouse experiments, where the animals were transplanted in with human iPSCs which then formed small teratomas. We have shown that treatment with an anti-CD47 antibody resulted in the loss of immune evasion and the rapid killing of these transplanted cells. We have identified several additional safety switches with in vivo activity and intend to continue to explore them, potentially including multiple safety switches in therapeutic programs moving forward.

CD47 overexpression is differentiated in inhibiting “missing self” response relative to other approaches
 
As part of our ongoing program to further refine our hypoimmune technology we evaluated the effectiveness of the overexpression of CD47 in comparison to other molecules that have at least some ability to inhibit innate immune responses. We carried out these head-to-head comparisons in K562 cells, a naturally MHC class I and class II deficient cell line. The lack of the MHC class I molecule should result in virtually instantaneous cell killing by stimulated innate immune cells such as NK cells due to the activation of the “missing self” response. We compared three molecules, HLA-E, HLA-G and PDL-1, that have previously been proposed to have a role in inhibiting innate immune responses versus CD47. In this assay, overexpression of these three molecules conferred limited protection from NK cell killing in contrast to CD47 overexpression. This difference in activity may be the result of the more ubiquitous presence of the receptor for CD47 receptor on innate immune cells relative to the presence of receptors for these other immunomodulators. While these results do not rule out a role for these other molecules in inhibiting NK cell responses, they suggest that CD47 may be sufficient to nullify the NK cell-mediated missing-self response.

Panels above show in vitro killing assays mediated by NK cells. Cells missing MHC molecules are killed by NK cells, as measured by rapid decline in cell index. Overexpression of immunomodulatory molecules such as HLA-E, HLA-G or PDL-1 in cells missing MHC molecules did not block NK cell killing. By contrast, overexpression of CD47 blocked NK cell mediated “missing-self” response.
 Our ex vivo Cell Engineering Pipeline 
 Allogeneic T Cell Program (SC291, SC276, SC255) 
 Our allogeneic T cell program utilizes T cells from healthy donors to generate CAR T therapies that will initially target CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B cell malignancies, to treat patients with refractory lymphoma. We believe that applying the hypoimmune technology to allogeneic T cells gives us an opportunity to create differentiated allogeneic CAR T therapies. 
 We believe our allogeneic T cell and T cell fusosome discovery programs provide us with two potentially disruptive programs to address the limitations of adoptive T cell therapy for cancer, each with idiosyncratic risks and opportunities. We also believe each approach can address separate and valuable opportunities if they are both successful. Specifically, our allogeneic T cell program offers the opportunity to perform multiple gene edits in a T cell, which may allow us to make intentional modifications to control T cell function or to deliver more complex chimeric receptors and signal integration machinery to enable the T cell to distinguish tumor cells based on surface antigen combinations to improve the specificity of targeting. These approaches may prove especially valuable in 
 20

targeting solid tumors, which have remained largely refractory to CAR T approaches to date. We also have an earlier-stage program looking to differentiate hypoimmune iPSCs into T cells. While we are still working to successfully create the appropriate T cells from an iPSC, we expect that progress with our allogeneic T cell program will also inform the iPSC T cell program. Separately, the fusogen technology allows for the in vivo generation of CAR T cells in a patient, offering a distinct advantage in terms of manufacturability and scalability that may enable the introduction of gene-modified T cells earlier in the course of a patient’s therapy. Additionally, modifying the T cells inside the body without the need for ex vivo manipulation of the cells may generate CAR T cells with more favorable attributes. 
 We intend to develop our CD19 allogeneic T cell therapies with the goal of submitting an IND for SC291 in 2022. We intend to follow this with SC276, a CD22-targeting allogeneic CAR T which could be combined with targeting CD19 and offers the potential benefit of higher and more durable complete response rates, with an IND submission as early as 2023. We are also advancing our SC255 allogeneic T cell program targeting BCMA for multiple myeloma, with the goal of submitting an IND in the next several years. 
 Background on B cell Malignancies 
 B cell malignancies represent a spectrum of cancers including non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and multiple myeloma (MM) and result in over 100,000 deaths per year in the United States and Europe. See the subsection titled “—in vivo Cell Engineering Pipeline—Background on B Cell Malignancies” for further background discussion. In addition to our in vivo cell engineering technology, we believe our ex vivo cell engineering technology also has the potential to address B cell malignancies. 
 Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 We believe our hypoimmune edited cells have the potential to create a differentiated platform for developing allogeneic T cells. There are two major hurdles to the use of allogeneic T cells. The first is the risk of graft versus host disease, in which the allogenic donor T cells target and kill recipient tissues. Multiple CAR T cell product candidates in clinical development have managed to prevent this reaction through gene edits targeting components of the T cell receptor such as TCR-alpha gene. The more significant challenge has been HvGR, in which the patient’s immune system kills the transplanted T cells. One strategy to approach this challenge has been to essentially eliminate the patient’s immune system, neutering its ability to find and destroy the transplanted allogeneic CAR T cells. This strategy has two limitations. First, the patient is at risk of severe infections during this period of substantial immune suppression. Second, as the immune system returns, it will inevitably reject the allogeneic CAR T cells, limiting the duration that these therapeutic cells are in the body. Experience with autologous CAR T cells in patients with B cell malignancies has demonstrated that persistence of CAR T cells is important for the durability of response. Thus, the ability to effectively prevent long term rejection of an allogeneic CAR T therapy without significant immune suppression would be a major advance. We are aware of other efforts to develop allogeneic CAR T cell products that focus on overcoming the adaptive immune system (T and B cells). Our technology addresses rejection mediated by both the adaptive and innate immune systems, giving us the potential to create a differentiated allogeneic CAR T solution. 
Our Allogeneic T Cell Program Approach 
 Our hypoimmune technology is designed to hide the cell from the patient’s immune system, and we are applying this technology to manufacture allogeneic CAR T cells. We intend to utilize T cells from healthy donors into which we will introduce the CAR gene and make the gene modifications necessary to overcome graft versus host disease and to incorporate our hypoimmune technology in an effort to address host versus graft response. We then intend to expand these cells ex vivo, with a goal of making many batches from a single donor as well as creating comparable CAR T cells from various healthy donors. These allogeneic CAR T therapies could be frozen and delivered as an “off the shelf” product for cancer patients without the need for severe immunosuppression. 
Preclinical Data 
 For our preclinical studies, human donor-derived T cells were genetically modified ex vivo, to generate cells bearing the hypoimmune edits (disruption of MHC class I/class II; overexpression of CD47), TCR-alpha disruption (to mitigate graft versus host disease) and the expression of a CD19 CAR. These cells were then tested in vivo for their tumor-killing activity in a human xenograft mouse model for leukemia (Nalm-6). These preclinical data suggest that the hypoimmune edits do not interfere with CAR T killing activity. We observed clearance of the leukemic cells by the hypoimmune CD19 CAR T cells and the potency of these cells was comparable to unmodified CD19 CAR T cells, which are similar to CAR T cells currently in clinical use.

Hypoimmune Donor-Derived CD19 CAR T Cells Clear Leukemia Cells in a Human Xenograft Mouse Model at Levels Comparable to Unmodified CD19 CAR T Cells 
 
Activity of hypoimmune donor-derived CD19 CAR T in a mouse leukemia xenograft model (Nalm-6). Note that when compared to untreated controls, infusion of unmodified CD19 CAR T or hypoimmune CAR T results in eradication of leukemia cells. Both cohorts of CAR T treated mice had significantly reduced tumor burden when compared to control as early as D7 (p≤0.0001; One-way ANOVA Bonferroni) with no significant difference between either of the treatment arms.
22

Furthermore, the hypoimmune CD19 CAR T cells were protected from immune system rejection in humanized mice, and no evidence was observed of either adaptive or innate immune system activation, in contrast to the unmodified CAR T cells: 
 Absence of T Cell, B Cell, NK Cell, and Macrophage Responses in a Human Xenograft Mouse Model Following Injection of Hypoimmune Donor-Derived CD19 CAR T Cells 
 
Immune cells from humanized animals receiving hypoimmune donor-derived CD19 CAR T showed no response when exposed to hypoimmune CAR T cells in vitro. Delivery of hypoimmune cells did not result in production of donor-specific antibodies, as evidenced by binding of IgM antibodies to the surface of donor cells (increased mean fluorescent intensity, MFI). Hypoimmune-edited cells were not susceptible to killing by NK cells nor macrophages, indicating protection from the “missing self” signal. 
Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 Process development work is ongoing within the Technical Operations team to develop scalable manufacturing processes to generate quality and consistent allogeneic T cell product candidates. In parallel, our cell engineering team is developing an efficient and specific gene editing platform to enable manufacturing of our allogeneic T cell product candidates. 
 The next major milestones are to complete Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) studies and GMP manufacturing with the goal of submitting an IND for SC291 in 2022. We believe that early data from the SC291 study will help us understand the therapeutic potential of this therapy, as the ability to evade immune detection with corresponding enhanced persistence of the CAR T may predict higher and more durable complete responses for patients. Additionally, it will give us insight into the potential of this hypoimmune platform for additional CAR T programs targeting other antigens and cancers as well as the potential for the platform more broadly in areas beyond cancer. Following the IND submission for SC291, we are progressing SC276, a CD22-targeting allogeneic CAR T which could be combined with targeting CD19 and offers the potential benefit of higher and more durable complete response rates, with the goal of submitting an IND as early as 2023. We are also advancing our SC255 allogeneic T cell program targeting BCMA for multiple myeloma, with the goal of submitting an IND in the next several years. 
Beta Cell Program 
 Our beta cell program aims to restore lifelong glucose control in Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM), patients by transplanting hypoimmune iPSC-derived beta cells. Current therapies for T1DM require continual management, and we believe that effectively restoring beta cell functionality will meaningfully improve patient outcomes for patients with T1DM. We intend to develop this program with the goal of submitting an IND for SC451 as early as 2023. 
 23

Background on Type 1 Diabetes 
 T1DM is an autoimmune disease in which the patient’s immune system destroys its own pancreatic beta cells. The destruction of these cells leads to complete loss of insulin production and a metabolic disease wherein patients are unable to control their blood glucose levels. Often called “juvenile diabetes”, this disease commonly has its onset in adolescence. Beta cells reside in specialized hormone-producing clusters within the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. In T1DM, activated T lymphocytes infiltrate the islets and selectively kill the beta cells, progressively reducing the body’s capacity to produce insulin. Once the reserve capacity of beta cells is exhausted, blood glucose rises, and the patient will have a life-long battle to control blood glucose levels. 
 T1DM affects 1.6 million adults in the United States, and there are approximately 20,000 new cases diagnosed per year in patients under the age of 20. In Europe there are an estimated 2.4 million adults with T1DM, and 300,000 under the age 20, with 31,000 new cases of T1DM diagnosed each year. Combining prevalence in the United States and Europe yields a pool of approximately 4 million patients with T1DM. 
 Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 Insulin injection is the main treatment option for T1DM. Despite significant advances in types of insulins, glucose monitoring, and insulin pumps, life expectancy for T1DM is still approximately 15 years shorter than for people without diabetes. Patients are at risk from acute complications of hyperglycemia, including diabetic ketoacidosis and coma. Conversely, they are also at risk of hypoglycemic episodes, particularly at night, which can lead to the “dead in bed” syndrome, thought to result from cardiac arrhythmias induced by low glucose. Long term elevations in blood glucose levels have particularly devastating effects on arteries and capillaries, resulting in premature myocardial infarction, stroke, limb ischemia, gangrene, kidney failure, and blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. “Insulin pumps,” which feature a computerized system for sensing blood glucose and delivering appropriate doses of insulin, have improved glycemic control. Notably, data from the FDA indicate that issues with insulin pumps are among the most frequently reported problems in their database. All current therapies require patients to carefully monitor their dietary intake, which, while inconvenient in adults, is a frequent point of failure in adolescents. 
 Pancreas transplantation for uncontrollable diabetes was first performed in the 1960s, and this established the principle that replacing the beta cells (here in the context of the whole pancreas) could restore physiological glucose control. Pancreas transplants are complicated surgical interventions, require lifelong immunosuppression, and are limited due to organ availability. Nevertheless, some 30,000 pancreas transplants have been performed worldwide to date. 
 Because of these challenges, the biomedical community began exploring pancreatic islet transplantation in the 1970s. This process involves enzymatic digestion of a donor pancreas and isolation of the Islets of Langerhans followed by delivery of these cells to an appropriate site in the body where the islets can engraft and become well vascularized. The major lessons from islet transplantation have been that glucose homeostasis can be restored, insulin-independence can be achieved, hemoglobin A1C levels (a marker of long-term glucose levels) can be normalized, and severe episodes of hypoglycemia can be reduced. As with an organ transplant, patients must be immune suppressed to prevent immune rejection of the transplanted cells. In addition to complications from this immune suppression and the lack of cell availability, the principal limitation of islet transplantation has been the therapy’s durability. Most patients lose glucose control over months to years and eventually become insulin-dependent again, primarily due to immune rejection of the allogeneic islets. 
 Our Beta Cell Program Approach 
 The goal of our beta cell hypoimmune program is to restore lifelong glucose control in T1DM patients by transplanting hypoimmune iPSC-derived beta cells, including beta cells. Our goal is to create a therapy that restores the body’s normal beta cell mass, giving patients physiologically appropriate glucose sensing ability and insulin secretion. We believe this therapy could reduce, or even eliminate, the hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, potentially enabling less onerous and costly treatment, fewer complications, and longer life expectancy, resulting in a meaningfully improved quality of life. 
 We focus our efforts around three goals: (i) deriving highly functional beta cells from PSCs, (ii) genetically modifying these cells to evade allogeneic immune responses, and (iii) genetically modifying these cells to evade autoimmune destruction of beta cells. This strategy requires building on lessons from pancreatic islet transplantation, recent advances in understanding pancreatic islet developmental biology, and our hypoimmune technology. 
 Deriving beta cells from iPSCs has the potential to solve limitations associated with donor pancreas and improve the overall product quality and product consistency. iPSCs have the potential to create a virtually limitless supply of these cells. Our program uses proprietary differentiation protocols to generate mature beta cells with glucose control comparable to primary human islets, as evidenced by our animal studies. Finally, we intend to modify the genomes of the iPSCs in order to apply our hypoimmune technology. If successful, the hypoimmune gene modifications will protect these cells from both auto-immune and allogeneic rejection 
 24

by the patient’s immune system and potentially remove the need for toxic immunosuppression in transplant recipients. Hypoimmunity also should eliminate the need for physical separation of the beta cells from the rest of the body by a device or encapsulation technology, which may allow for tighter control of glucose by eliminating the lag time between glucose sensing and insulin secretion. 
 Preclinical Data 
 We are developing a proprietary protocol that will differentiate hypoimmune iPSCs into mature, glucose-sensitive, insulin-secreting beta cells based on licensed technology from Washington University in St. Louis. This technology enables differentiation of beta cells at a greater purity and with superior function compared to published stem cell-based protocols. The principal function of beta cells is to maintain steady levels of glucose in circulation. The beta cells sense when glucose levels rise in the bloodstream and release insulin in response. In vitro, our beta cells respond to glucose and robustly secrete insulin at an equivalent level to primary human islets, as depicted in the figure below. 
 Human iPSC-Derived Beta Cells Exhibit Glucose-Induced Insulin Release 
 
Human islets from cadaveric pancreases (gold standard) exhibit robust insulin secretion in response to an increase in glucose levels. Human iPSC-derived beta cells using technology licensed from Washington University in St. Louis show similar dynamics of insulin secretion to the cadaveric islets. 
 These stem cell-derived beta cells were tested in a mouse model of Type I diabetes induced by the beta cell toxin, streptozotocin. When transplanted into the kidney of the diabetic mice, these beta cells normalize glucose levels in an equivalent fashion to primary human islets. The diabetic glucose levels return when the grafts are surgically excised (nephrectomy). Similar to the human phenotype, diabetic mice cannot normalize circulating glucose levels following a glucose injection. Following transplantation of our beta cells, these mice rapidly normalized blood glucose in an equivalent fashion to both non-diabetic mice and diabetic mice that received human primary islet transplants.

In vivo Performance of iPSC-Derived Beta Cells in a Mouse Model of T1DM

Top: Normalization of blood glucose levels after transplantation of cadaveric human islet cells or iPSC-derived islet cells obtained by planar or suspension differentiation (Washington University technology). Note the rapid normalization of blood glucose with cadaveric and stem cell-derived islets with the planar protocol, with slower normalization using the suspension protocol. In all groups, removal of the graft by nephrectomy re-induced diabetes, indicating the correction resulted from the transplant. STZ, streptozotocin, is a toxin for beta-islet cells that induces diabetes in animal models.

 We ran an experiment to better understand whether hypoimmune edits impair the function of islet cells and to confirm that these edits enable the islets to evade immune responses. For these experiments, we made the hypoimmune genetic modifications in human islets isolated from cadaveric human donors. These cells were transplanted intramuscularly, without immunosuppression, into a humanized mouse strain, a mouse strain engrafted with human immune cells that mimic certain aspects of the human immune system. Type 1 diabetes was induced in this mouse model with streptozotocin, and the ability of transplanting islet cells to restore normal glucose levels while evading immune rejection was tested. We found that hypoimmune edited human donor islets were successful in restoring glucose control while unmodified islets failed to do so. The key driver of this difference was that, while human donor islets with hypoimmune edits survived for the full duration of the experiment (approximately 30 days), unmodified islets were rapidly rejected within a week. These data demonstrate that hypoimmune edits do not impair the ability of cadaveric islet cells to restore glucose homeostasis, but they do prevent rejection of these cells in mice with humanized immune systems.
 We next tested whether our hypoimmune edited cells could survive in serum containing autoreactive antibodies and T cells from patients with Type I diabetes. We exposed pancreatic islets with or without our hypoimmune edits to serum and T cells from patients with Type I diabetes. As expected, both T cells and antibodies from patients recognize and kill unedited pancreatic islets. In contrast, these T cells and antibodies from Type I diabetics did not recognize or kill our hypoimmune edited islet cells. The results from this experiment increase our confidence that, in addition to preventing allogeneic rejection, our hypoimmune technology may allow islet cells to survive autoimmune killing in patients with Type I diabetes without the need for immunosuppression.

Diabetes was induced via streptozotocin treatment that results in loss of glycemic control as visualized by an immediate and sustained increase in serum glucose. Transplantation of unmodified human donor derived pancreatic islets had no effect on serum glucose levels. By contrast hypoimmune human donor derived islets successfully lowered serum glucose levels as measured by a glucose tolerance test.
 Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 Our work is currently focused on manufacturing GMP-grade, gene-edited, pluripotent stem cell banks; scaling manufacturing; and characterizing the product. We are working through the process development and IND-enabling studies to allow for an IND submission for SC451 as early as 2023. 
 GPC Program 
 Our GPC program aims to deliver healthy allogeneic GPCs, the precursors to both astroglia and myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. This program has the potential to treat myelin and glial-based disorders, which represent a broad group of debilitating neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and a number of neurodegenerative disorders, none of which have effective treatment alternatives. We intend to develop our stem cell derived GPC therapies for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease other disorders of myelin, Huntington’s disease, and other astrocytic diseases. Our goal is to submit three INDs for SC379 in the next several years. 
 Background on Myelin and Glial Based Disorders 
 Glial cells are the support cells of the human CNS. The two major types of CNS-derived glial cells are oligodendrocytes—the cells that produce myelin, the insulating substance of the brain’s white matter that enables neural conduction and astrocytes, the support cells of neurons and their synapses. These two kinds of glial cells arise from human GPCs (hGPCs), are responsible for remyelination in the injured and demyelinated adult brain and spinal cord. 
 Diseases of glial cells are among the most prevalent and disabling conditions in neurology. These disorders include the disorders of oligodendrocyte loss and myelin failure and the disorders of astrocytes, which include a number of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. What all these disorders have in common is a significant glial contribution to their pathogenesis, and a lack of disease-modifying treatment options. 
 28

Congenital Leukodystrophies. A number of hereditary disorders of oligodendrocyte loss or dysfunction are characterized by a failure in myelin synthesis or structural stability. Tens of thousands of children in the United States suffer from diseases of myelin loss. The most prototypic example of this class of diseases is Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), an X-linked leukodystrophy most often manifesting in male infants and young boys, caused by mutations in the oligodendrocytic PLP1 gene, which results in widespread hypomyelination. There is no treatment for PMD, which is typically fatal in childhood. We intend to deliver intracerebral transplants of stem cell-derived GPCs to the brains of PMD patients, with the goal of replacing PLP1 mutant oligodendrocytes with healthy cells capable of producing normally compact myelin. Prevalence of PMD in the general population is estimated to be approximately 1 in 100,000 in the United States. While we are initially targeting PMD as our proof of concept, congenital leukodystrophies as a group affect a more significant population, or about 1 in 7,600 births. 
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a debilitating disease characterized by both inflammatory myelinolysis and degenerative axonal loss. There are two major forms, the initial relapsing remitting form, known as RRMS, and its later progressive neurodegenerative phase designated secondary progressive MS (SPMS). RRMS is characterized by clearly defined attacks with new or increasing neurologic symptoms. In contrast, SPMS is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration with a loss of neurons, including those that were previously demyelinated during the RRMS phase of the disease. The demyelination occurs in a diffuse fashion throughout the adult brain and appears to reflect a loss of axonal support by local oligodendrocytes. The delivery of GPCs into such chronically demyelinated brain may offer tangible benefits through the oligodendrocytic engagement of axons, as well as by myelin repair. MS is highly prevalent, with estimates of up to 1.0 million in the United States, 600,000 in Europe, and 2.8 million patients globally. Approximately 85% of MS patients receive a diagnosis of RRMS initially while 15% of patients are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). Up to a third of RRMS patients transition to secondary progressive MS within a decade if untreated, and most will progress to SPMS within 20-25 years of diagnosis. Success with a stem cell derived GPC product in SPMS, and especially with a hypoimmune product, could enable further expansion into the RRMS patient population. 
 Huntington’s Disease (HD). HD is a neurodegenerative disorder in which glial pathology appears to make a significant causal contribution. It is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormally long CAG repeat expansions in the first exon of the Huntingtin gene. The encoded polyglutamine expansions of mutant huntingtin protein disrupts its normal functions and protein-protein interactions, ultimately yielding widespread neuropathology, most rapidly evident in the neostriatum. We have found that glial pathology is a major contributor to the functional deficits of HD and repairing the glial pathology has significant and positive effects in animal models. There are approximately 41,000 symptomatic Americans and more than 200,000 at-risk of inheriting HD. In Europe, there are approximately 50,000 patients with HD. 
Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 Congenital Leukodystrophies. There are no viable treatment options for these conditions, only supportive and palliative therapies for symptoms as they present. 
 MS. Current treatments for MS are largely limited to treatments for RRMS; few treatments are approved for SPMS, and these have at best marginal efficacy in delaying disease progression; none are restorative. Currently approved treatments for RRMS may be divided into three broad categories of disease modifying therapies: (i) first line injectables (such as beta-interferons, Copaxone), (ii) newer oral agents (such as Tecfidera, Gilenya, Mayzent, Zeposia), and (iii) high-efficacy agents (such as Tysabri, Lemtrada, Ocrevus). Despite many recently successful drug launches in the RRMS space, these drugs still only slow the progression of disease and aid in the recovery from attacks, and there remains no treatment that confers functional restoration or effective cure for this disease. 
 HD. Currently, there is no treatment to stop or reverse Huntington’s disease. Treatment is limited to several medications that can help minimize symptoms, including the drug tetrabenazine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, and tranquilizers. 
Our GPC Program Approach 
 Our approach to treat myelin and neurodegenerative disorders is via the delivery of healthy allogeneic stem cell-derived GPCs. We have developed methods for producing and isolating these cells from pluripotent stem cells and delivering them in the purity and quantities necessary for their replacement of endogenous diseased cells. We believe that both the myelin disorders and glial-based neurodegenerative conditions have compelling potential for our ex vivo therapy. 
 Preclinical Data 
 Congenital Leukodystrophies. The capacity of stem cell-derived GPCs for remyelination has been conducted in animal models of congenital hypomyelination. Our collaborators used newborn shiverer mice that have a genetic defect in myelin basic protein (MBP), resulting in their neurons being hypomyelinated and the mice having a shortened lifespan. When iPSC-derived hGPCs were transplanted into these mice, the cells spread widely throughout the brain, developing as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocytes generated mature myelin that effectively restored neuronal conductance and prolonged survival in the transplanted 
 29

mice. We believe that these data suggest the feasibility of iPSC-derived hGPC implantation in treating childhood disorders of myelin formation and maintenance, as depicted in the figure below: 
 
hGPCs myelinate widely to greatly extend the survival of hypomyelinated mice. A, Dot map indicating distribution of human iPSC-derived GPCs at 7 months of age, following neonatal engraftment in a shiverer mouse brain.

E, Kaplan-Meier plot of survival of iPSC-OPC implanted (n=22) vs. saline-injected (n=19) control mice. Scale: A-B, 2 mm. Adapted from Wang, Cell SC 2013. 
 MS. Our prior studies established the ability of stem-cell derived hGPCs to myelinate the developing shiverer brain and rescue the afflicted mice; however, the experimental subjects were neonates, not adults. Until recently, it was unclear whether GPCs are able to migrate extensively in adult brain tissue, as would be required for the repair of diffusely demyelinated adult brains. To explore whether the introduction of stem-cell derived hGPCs delivered directly into the adult brain could remyelinate axons in the setting as might be encountered clinically in multiple sclerosis our collaborators studied three different biologic models. First, it was shown that stem-cell derived hGPCs can disperse within and myelinate the brains of adult shiverer mice (as depicted in the figure below). Second, it was shown that neonatally-engrafted hGPCs engrafted as a neonate can generate new oligodendrocytes and remyelinate demyelinated axons after chemically induced demyelination. This result demonstrated the ability of already-resident hGPCs to remyelinate previously myelinated axons after a new demyelinating insult as an adult, as well as the ability of transplanted hGPCs to reside as a functional reservoir of new myelinogenic cells in the host brains. Third, it was shown that hGPCs transplanted into the adult brain after chemically induced demyelination can remyelinate denuded axons. These data suggest that transplanted hGPCs can disperse broadly and differentiate as myelinogenic cells in the adult brain, and that they are able to remyelinate demyelinated axons and white matter lesions of the brain after an insult as an adult.

hGPCs Mediate Robust Myelination After Transplantation into the Adult Shiverer Brain 
 
Human GPCs proved both highly migratory and robustly myelinogenic, after delivery to the hypomyelinated adult shiverer x rag2-/- brain. A, By 19-20 weeks of age (mice were injected as post-weaning adults, at 4-6 wks) the injected cells had dispersed broadly throughout the forebrain white matter. B, hGPCs delivered to myelin wild-type rag2-/- mice distributed throughout both gray and white matter. C, Oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelinogenesis by donor hGPCs was robust, with myelination of brain regions that would typically be demyelinated in shiverer mice D, a higher power image of C shows the high proportion of donor cells in those brain regions. Note that DAPI marks all nuclei, hN marks the hGPCs, and MBP marks the remyelinated regions in C and D. From Windrem et al, Cell Reports 2020. 
 HD. Our collaborators explored the cellular basis for HD related glial pathology and identified significant defects in potassium channel and glutamate uptake mechanisms in HD glia, which appeared to account for both the glial pathology and its deleterious effects on synaptic function. Together, these studies suggest a critical role for glial pathology in the progression of HD and suggested the potential for glial cell replacement as a therapeutic strategy in HD, and more broadly, to other neurodegenerative diseases in which glial pathology might be causally contributory. It was confirmed in preclinical mouse studies that stem-cell derived hGPC transplant ameliorated both the neuronal and glial pathology of HD by restoring synaptic homeostasis and normal synaptic function to the most affected regions of the host brain. 
 The majority of the studies with human GPCs thus far have been xenogeneic grafts of human GPCs to neonatal or adult mice or rats (and in a small sample POC study limited to adult tissue-derived hGPCs, NHPs). Our collaborators have also performed studies with murine GPCs transplanted into both developing and adult mice, which have confirmed allogeneic GPC migration and integration. However, we have no assurance that human GPC engraftment of human brain will result in the widespread migration and colonization of host brain that is seen with xenogeneic grafts. To better model the human-to-human graft paradigm, our collaborators have established a new model to evaluate if GPC engraftment will result in migration and colonization in a host brain. This model allows observation of the competitive interactions of the two separately tagged human GPC populations. The human-into-human grafts expanded and integrated well in their humanized host, with competitive interactions. As might be anticipated in the clinical setting of healthy cells being transplanted for the purpose of replacing lost or diseased hGPCs, the healthy donor cells outcompete both diseased and older cells to ultimately colonize the hosts. These data have provided preclinical assurance of the fundamental premise of our approach, that healthy human donor cells can replace lost or diseased human cells in vivo. That said, this determination remains to be made in patients. 
 31

GMP Grade Stem Cell Derived hGPCs for Clinical Studies 
 A protocol to direct differentiation of human ESCs, as well as iPSCs, to hGPCs has been established. These hGPCs cells remain bipotential for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and they differentiate to either fate depending on local signaling. 
 This protocol has been transferred to a GMP facility in order to enable production of clinical grade cells for both safety and efficacy testing. These cells have been validated to robustly remyelinate shiverer mouse brains upon intracerebral transplantation. We plan to use these cells for our IND-enabling studies and initial clinical trial material. 
 Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 Progression of SC379 to IND is planned to follow completion of definitive safety and toxicology studies. Definitive preclinical efficacy studies using the anticipated clinical product are also planned and will replicate studies that we have published. Since GPCs are not a terminally differentiated cell type and divide and differentiate in vivo post-transplantation, we will continue to assess potential safety risks, including the risk of tumorigenicity. We expect to submit IND applications for SC379 for SPMS, PMD, and HD in the next several years. 
Cardiomyocyte Program 
 Background on Heart Failure 
 Heart failure (HF) is a classic example of a disease of cell loss, ideally suited to the application of ex vivo engineered cells. The clear but ambitious goal of our program is to replace missing cells after a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, in an attempt to restore heart function and improve outcomes for patients. HF is a life-threatening syndrome, and patients with HF have a mortality rate of 20-30% within one year of diagnosis and a mortality rate of around 50% within five years of diagnosis. 
 HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), is a severe form of HF where heart muscle is unable to contract, and therefore pump, adequately. HFrEF is most frequently a consequence of a loss of heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), following a myocardial infarction. In the United States, there were approximately 380,000 deaths associated with HF in 2018 according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and an overall prevalence of approximately 6 million people with HF, with similar numbers in Europe. 
 In general, HF has been a challenging area for drug and device development, including only one new drug, Entresto, approved in the last 20 years, and a limited number of devices introduced including electrical resynchronization therapy and implantation of left ventricular assistance devices (LVADs). These approaches provide only symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying loss of cardiomyocytes associated with HFrEF. As a result, HFrEF currently remains a progressive and deadly disease with a large unmet need worldwide. 
 To date, efforts to develop cell-based therapies to address this unmet need have provided little evidence of clinical benefit. Importantly, these attempts have typically utilized cells such as bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells and mesenchymal stromal cells where any potential benefit would be limited to paracrine mechanisms and not the direct replacement of lost cardiomyocytes. 
 Our cardiomyocyte program aims to directly regenerate the heart, by replacing lost cardiomyocytes with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, with the goal of restoring heart muscle and increasing ejection fraction, which is the percentage of blood the heart pumps with each heartbeat. Replacement of lost cardiomyocytes with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes that engraft and function correctly has the potential to prevent or even reverse the progression of HFrEF. 
 Developing an ideal stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte therapy involves many steps, including: 
  
• | differentiating cardiomyocytes at scale that engraft upon transplantation, beat in synchrony with the host heart muscle, and improve heart function;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | engineering cardiomyocytes to avoid rejection due to the host immune response to the transplanted cells, without requiring immunosuppression; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressing the risks associated with potential transient arrhythmias, or temporary abnormal heart beats, following transplantation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Differentiating Cardiomyocytes at Scale that Engraft, Beat Correctly and in Synchrony with the Host Heart Muscle, and Improve Host Heart Function 
 Scientists, including Dr. Chuck Murry, our Senior Vice President, Head of Cardiometabolic Cell Therapy, have been working for over 20 years towards developing a regenerative therapy for HFrEF with the goal of transplanting cardiomyocytes derived from 
 32

human pluripotent stem cells that engraft, function, and persist in the human heart in vivo. The groundwork for potential future clinical development has been laid by key breakthroughs such as the ability to direct the differentiation of stem cells selectively into cardiomyocytes, including producing pharmaceutical grade cardiomyocytes at large scale in bioreactors, and the ability to transplant such cardiomyocytes to induce remuscularization of injured hearts. 
 Initial preclinical attempts to remuscularize the infarcted heart were unsuccessful due to death of the transplanted cells within a few days of delivery. None of the animals with failed engraftment showed improvement in cardiac function, indicating that engraftment is essential for functional improvement. Our collaborators developed a pro-survival cocktail that kept cells alive through the rigors of transplantation, allowing the cardiomyocytes to self-assemble into new muscle tissue and induce ingrowth of new blood vessels and connective tissue from the surrounding heart muscle. Once engraftment was successful, cardiac function improved. As our collaborators’ capabilities to scale cell manufacturing increased, studies progressed from mice to rats to guinea pigs, all showing improved function: 
 Human ESC-Cardiomyocytes Improve Function in Injured Rat and Guinea Pig Hearts 
 
Left panel: functional rescue in rat. All groups showed comparably reduced fractional shortening after infarction at 2 days pre-transplantation (Pre-Tx). At 28 days post-transplantation there was preservation of fractional shortening in animals receiving hESC-cardiomyocytes, with deterioration of function in all other groups. PSC, pro-survival cocktail. SFM, serum-free media. **p<0.01; # p<0.05 vs. 2 days Pre-Tx. Right panel: functional rescue in guinea pig. Following cardiac injury at 2 days before transplantation, all groups showed comparably reduced fractional shortening. At 28 days post-transplantation there was preservation of function in animals receiving hESC-cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM), with deterioration of function in other groups. *p<0.05. **p<0.01. †p<0.05 vs 2 days Pre-Tx. From Laflamme et al, Nature Biotechnology 2007 (left) and Shiba et al, Nature 2012 (right). 
 Current methods demonstrate regeneration of the hearts of large animals including pigs and NHPs by transplanting human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM). The figure below shows low magnification microscopic images from NHP hearts that were infarcted and then received either hESC-CM or saline controls. The replacement of heart muscle by scar tissue is evident in the saline-treated heart, whereas human heart muscle has repopulated the infarct in the hESC-CM treated group. 
 33

Remuscularization of the Heart of an NHP by hESC-CM Transplantation 
 
The saline-treated heart (left) shows infarct scar tissue (blue) replacing the myocardium lost to infarction. The hESC-CM treated heart (right) shows a large graft of human heart muscle (green) replacing the myocardium lost to infarction. From Liu et al, Nature Biotechnology 2018. Scale bar, 5 mm. 
 We conducted an experiment to help us understand the mechanism of action and learn whether the transplanted muscle beat in synchrony with the host heart muscle. hESC-CMs were genome-edited to express a protein that fluoresced green with each contraction, and their behavior was studied after transplantation into an infarcted macaque heart. hESC-CMs showed 1:1 synchrony with the host heart, indicating that the graft follows the heart’s natural pacemaker, an essential result for heart regeneration. 
 A final question was whether this regeneration improves the function of the injured heart. To assess this, engrafted NHP hearts were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the gold standard for assessing cardiac contractile function. As illustrated in the figure below, myocardial infarction induced a 25-point drop in left ventricular ejection fraction, the fraction of blood ejected from the heart with each beat. 
 Control animals receiving a saline injection showed no significant improvement at 4 or 12 weeks, as expected. In contrast, four weeks after receiving hESC-CMs, ejection fraction improved by approximately 10 points, and by 12 weeks, it had improved by a total of approximately 22 points. While the number of animals followed for 12 weeks is limited, cardiac remuscularization in this study restored ventricular function back into the normal range. In contrast, the current standard of care for myocardial infarction, including reperfusion via angioplasty, ACE inhibitors, and beta blockers, increases ejection fraction by approximately 6 points. 
 34

Restoration of Cardiac Function in NHPs by Transplantation of Human ESC-derived Cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) 
 
Myocardial infarction reduces ejection fraction (a measure of cardiac function), and there is no spontaneous recovery in control animals receiving a saline injection (gray). All animals receiving hESC-CM (blue) showed significant improvement by 4 weeks, and by 12 weeks after treatment, cardiac function was restored to the normal range. 
 In summary, structural data demonstrating extensive remuscularization of the infarcted heart in conjunction with physiologic and pharmacodynamic data provide evidence that the transplanted cardiomyocytes directly restore heart contractile function. 
 Engineering the cells to avoid rejection due to the host immune response to the transplanted cells 
 Initially, we plan to establish safety with first-in-human clinical trials of our cardiomyocyte cell therapy using immunosuppression to reduce the risk of a host immune response to allogeneic transplanted cells and the potential immune rejection. Our collaborators have studied immunosuppressive regimens in NHP by transplanting rhesus cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells into the hearts of mismatched recipient NHP. An immunosuppressive regimen was identified that keeps the allogeneic grafts alive long term and is considerably less toxic than regimens used for heart transplantation. However, an approach that obviates the need for an immunosuppression regimen has the potential to improve safety and patient eligibility. Therefore, as part of our program lifecycle we intend to switch to a hypoimmune stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte over time, as this should allow us to eliminate or reduce the immune suppression required for durable maintenance of these cells. 
 Addressing the risks associated with potential transient arrhythmias, or abnormal heart beats, following cell transplantation 
 The term engraftment arrhythmia refers to a transient period of unstable electrical activity that occurs in some species over approximately four weeks following cardiomyocyte transplantation. Engraftment arrhythmias were not observed in mice, rats, or guinea pigs (probably because their natural heart rates are too fast), but they are observed in NHPs, where they cause mild symptoms, and in farm pigs, where they cause more significant symptoms. The arrhythmias follow a stereotypical course, where they increase in frequency and duration, plateau for a variable period, and then wane until the heart has normal rhythm once again. Once the heart rhythm stabilizes, the arrhythmias seem to disappear permanently. We are exploring three ways to address engraftment arrhythmias: pharmaceutical interventions, genetic modifications to the cardiomyocytes, and adjusting the stage of differentiation of the cardiomyocytes. Electrical mapping studies in NHPs and pigs suggest that the engraftment arrhythmias originate from the site of the cell injection, likely from the injected cardiomyocytes. The stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes in these experiments are more similar to fetal cardiomyocytes than their adult counterparts, and while this favors their engraftment it potentially increases the risk for the 
 35

induction of arrhythmias. We compared the expression and function of ion channels, proteins regulating the electrical properties of cardiomyocytes, in immature versus mature cardiomyocytes. We identified multiple ion channels which showed differential activity, including HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A1 which are active, as well as KCNJ2 which is inactive, in immature cardiomyocyte relative to mature ones. We subsequently assessed the impact of modulation of a variety of combinations of ion channels in animal studies. We found that PSC-derived cardiomyocytes in which the expression of HCN4, CACNA1H, and SLC8A1 has been abolished and the expression of KCNJ2 has been activated (“MEDUSA cells”) creates cardiomyocytes that lack endogenous pacemaking ability but can follow exogenously supplied electrical stimulation. MEDUSA cells robustly engraft but do not induce arrythmias in a pig model. We are currently testing whether MEDUSA cells can effectively restore heart function in infarcted NHPs as well as the longer-term potential impacts of modifying these ion channels in cardiomyocytes.
 MEDUSA cells do not induce arrythmia after transplantation in a pig model

Wildtype stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte grafts induce arrhythmias after transplantation into pig hearts (blue circles), shown by the rise in heart rate and the increased arrhythmia burden (percentage of day spent in arrhythmia). Black circle indicates one wildtype animal that died from complications of the arrhythmia. In contrast, MEDUSA-edited cardiomyocytes (3 KO/1 OE; orange squares) do not induce arrhythmias.

Immunostaining for human cardiac muscle (human-specific slow skeletal troponin I stain, brown) demonstrates large grafts of human myocardium in the heart of a pig receiving MEDUSA cells. Thus, absence of engraftment arrhythmia is not due to absence of engraftment.
 36

Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 Our key milestones include understanding any potential impact on function and safety of these MEDUSA edits, their ability to protect longer-term from the risk of arrhythmias, completing GLP toxicology studies, and additional efficacy and safety studies in NHPs and pigs, with the goal of submitting an IND in the next several years. We plan to finalize our clinical plan based on the results of ongoing studies in NHPs using the MEDUSA edits in stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes as well as early results from humans in other settings with our hypoimmune platforms. 
 Our in vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 Overview 
 In vivo cell engineering aims to treat human disease by delivering a therapeutic payload to cells inside a patient’s body to repair or control genes. Historically there have been four key challenges to in vivo cell engineering: 
  
• | Delivering any payload (such as DNA, RNA, proteins, organelles, integrating versus non-integrating, size),
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to any cell (by increasing the volume of distribution),
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | in a specific (for instance just T cells), and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | repeatable way (such as achieving limited immunogenicity to allow re-dosing).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our in vivo cell engineering platform is focused on engineering fusogens that, when combined with delivery vehicles, can effectively deliver a payload to a desired cell or location in the appropriate quantities in vivo. The combination of a fusogen with a delivery vehicle referred to as a fusosome. We believe our platform provides us with the flexibility to deliver a wide range of payloads to make different modifications for different diseases, as well as delivery vehicle options to address volume of distribution and re-dosing, which could fundamentally expand the treatment potential of in vivo therapies. 
 Our Approach to Building our in vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 We have approached the development of our in vivo cell engineering platform by investing in solutions to overcome the key challenges outlined above: 
  
• | Delivery. We believe the critical limitation for in vivo cell engineering is delivery, and therefore, we are investing significantly in delivery technologies, including our fusogen technology, which is designed to enable both cell-specific delivery and delivery of diverse payloads. We were founded with core technology in this area which was the product of a multi-year effort by a Flagship Labs innovation team at Flagship Pioneering led by Dr. Geoffrey von Maltzahn, one of our board members. This effort is led by Dr. Jagesh Shah, our VP, Gene Therapy Technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gene modification. There has been substantial recent progress in gene modification and the field is now at the point where virtually any desired modification can be performed in vitro. However, no single technology or platform is optimal for all possible applications. To this end, we are developing capabilities across multiple technologies and investing to develop our own novel technologies to be applied on a case-by-case basis, an effort that is led by Dr. Ed Rebar, our Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer. We also have entered, and intend to enter more, agreements with other companies that have capabilities in this area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing. We are investing proactively in process development, analytical development, CMC regulatory, supply chain, quality, and other manufacturing sciences in order to enable scalable manufacturing of our in vivo therapies and ensure broad access. We have also built a pilot manufacturing plant in South San Francisco, California and entered into a long-term lease agreement for a facility in Fremont, California, where we intend to build our own clinical trial and commercial GMP manufacturing capabilities. These efforts are led by Dr. Stacey Ma, our Executive Vice President, Technical Operations.

 Our Approach to Building our in vivo Cell Engineering Portfolio 
 We have prioritized cell types for our programs where: 
  
• | existing proof of concept in humans and animal models demonstrates that in vivo cell engineering should have a clinical benefit;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on this prioritization, we are initially focused on three cell types: T Cells, Hepatocytes, Hematopoietic Stem Cells 
 History of in vivo Cell Engineering and Current Limitations 
 Starting several decades ago, the nascent field of gene therapy focused on experimenting with different means of transmitting genetic payloads via viral vectors. Seminal work by Dr. Richard Mulligan, our Executive Vice-Chairman and Head of SanaX, and colleagues established the promise of gene therapy by delivering genes into host chromosomes, thereby correcting genetic deficits. More recently, significant investments have resulted in improved safety and efficacy of viral vectors. However, most approaches continue to concentrate on adapting the innate capabilities of various viruses to transmit these payloads. 
 Profound benefits have been realized in cases where there is direct correlation between the biological activity transmitted by the therapy and the genetic activity that is missing in the patient. AAV vectors, which are broadly used by gene therapy researchers due to their broad tissue tropism, lack of pathogenicity, and ability to target both dividing and non-dividing cells. While these therapies have had a categorical impact on their target patient populations, they have only scratched the surface of the potential of in vivo cell engineering, with success limited to a small number of patients. 
 Broad impact of gene therapies has been limited by challenges within three key areas: 
 Payload delivery is limited by:
 
• | Limited Cell Specificity. Most commonly used AAV vectors have broad tissue specificities. If a specific type of cell needs to be targeted within a tissue or organ to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, a lack of targeting specificity can result in a limited amount of payload reaching the desired cell. Moreover, the transduction of non-target cells can necessitate the use of high doses of vector to achieve the maximal therapeutic effect in the desired target tissue, which in turn can lead to toxicities due to the transduction of non-target cells, as well as create challenges in manufacturing at adequate scale. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) target any cell expressing the LDL receptor, making them both non-specific and mainly absorbed by hepatocytes in the liver when dosed systemically.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited Volume of Distribution. Volume of distribution refers to the ability of a therapeutic to reach various tissues. While AAV vectors can be used to systemically deliver payloads to certain tissues, such as muscle, in the case of other therapeutically important targets, such as cells of the CNS, only a small proportion of cells can be transduced.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immunogenicity. Most viruses used as vectors elicit an immune response in the patient, causing the patient’s immune system to attack the vector. Previous exposure to the virus used as a vector increases the immune response and may limit the benefit or create safety issues for the patient. Many patients, for example, demonstrate pre-existing antibodies to specific AAV serotypes which can limit transduction efficiencies, and therefore clinical benefit. Furthermore, once an AAV vector is administered to a patient, in most cases the infection leads to an immune response that precludes the ability to re-dose.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Genome modification is limited by: 
  
• | Payload Size and Type Restrictions. The natural genome size of a virus vector imposes a discrete limit on the amount of biological information that can be transmitted. Currently, there exist a number of important disease targets that require the delivery of payloads too large for AAV, which has a maximum payload capacity between 4.5-5kb. In addition to the need to deliver sequences encoding a desired protein that may not fit into an AAV vector, the increasing interest in the use of gene-editing machinery to correct specific gene defect via homologous recombination or transposition will require delivery vehicles capable of a larger payload capacity than is currently available. For most viruses currently used for in vivo therapy, the payload type is generally limited to the specific genetic material of the virus (e.g., DNA or RNA). The ability to deliver additional payloads, such as proteins, could unlock novel therapeutic opportunities. Non-viral delivery with LNPs has been limited to RNA and proteins to date, with an inability to deliver DNA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Durability Limitations. Obtaining the persistence of the desired level of expression over long periods of times can be problematic, due to both immune reactions and the silencing of vector expression. In cases where the target cells are undergoing replication, as can be the case in pediatric patients for example, durability of expression by non-integrating vectors or delivery of material that does not permanently change the cell’s DNA can also be limited by the gradual loss of vector sequences as infected cells replicate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 38

Execution in manufacturing is limited by: 
  
• | Complex manufacturing. Today, the adage of “the process is the product” applies with particular relevance to these in vivo viral vector-based therapies. These therapies are relatively more complex to characterize and control during manufacturing compared to other common biologically derived modalities such as recombinant proteins and antibodies. Similarly, process and analytical sciences that can enable significant scale-up for in vivo therapies are still well behind that of proteins and antibodies. Current vector manufacturing has limited scale and yield, which limits access for patients.

Our Solution – Fusogen Technology 
 To address some of the existing challenges of in vivo cell engineering, we are developing our fusogen technology by engineering proteins found in nature to enable the delivery of any payload to specific cells. 
 Background on Fusogens 
 Fusogens are a well-studied class of naturally occurring proteins that mediate the trillions of cell-to-cell and intracellular fusion events occurring in the human body every second. In 2013, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for the elucidation of the roles of fusogens in mediating intracellular trafficking in nature. First, fusogens enable recognition of a specific target membrane. Second, they promote membrane fusion by acting as thermodynamic engines for opposing membranes, pulling them together and thereby promoting fusion. 
 39

Our Fusogen Technology 
 

Fusogens are widely used by enveloped viruses to confer target specificity and to drive the process of introducing material in target cells. A well-known current example of a viral fusogen is the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. This virus uses its spike glycoprotein to target cells expressing the ACE2 receptor and to fuse with the cell membrane of host cells and release the viral genome into the cell. Many other biological processes utilizing fusogens for the delivery of complex, diverse, and large payloads to specific cell types have also been found. For example, the process of fertilization occurs as a result of a sperm fusing specifically with the egg and the transfer of the paternal genetic material to the oocyte. Similarly, the fusion of myoblasts with other myoblasts is essential for the formation, growth, and regeneration of skeletal muscle. The myoblast delivers an entire novel nucleus to the muscle cell, highlighting the utility of this system to deliver quite large and complex payloads. These and a myriad of other processes rely on this vast class of protein machines. 
 Applying fusogens to in vivo cell engineering 
 Building on both our team’s deep understanding of fusogen biology and extensive research in protein engineering, we are developing a technology designed to allow us to engineer the biological properties of these naturally occurring proteins. In doing so, we are developing a highly modular system that can specifically target numerous cell surface receptors and thereby deliver diverse therapeutic payloads to a variety of cell types. 
 40

Our current programs use fusogens derived from a virus from the paramyxoviridae family. The fusogen protein complex is comprised of two proteins: the receptor recognition G protein and membrane fusion F protein. The combination of a fusogen with a delivery vehicle such as a gene therapy vector or lipid vesicle is referred to as a fusosome. The diagram below depicts the mechanism of fusogen-mediated membrane fusion. This protein complex is found on the outer membrane of the fusosome (1). As the fusosome interacts with cells, only those with the target receptor will engage the G protein of the fusogen complex (2). The binding of the G protein to the receptor stimulates the F protein to initiate its membrane fusion activity. The F protein first partially unfolds to bind to the target membrane (3) and then refolds to bring the target and fusosome membranes in proximity (4), to ultimately promote membrane fusion (5), and subsequent payload delivery. 
 Mechanism of Fusogen-Mediated Membrane Fusion 
 

The G protein has the potential to be engineered for a high degree of cell selectivity. To accomplish this, we first engineer the G protein so that its natural binding domain is no longer functional. We then add a targeting scaffold to the G protein that re-directs the fusogen to a cell-specific receptor. The targeting scaffold can be any one of naturally occurring or synthetic single chain affinity binders, such as single chain variable fragment (scFvs), camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs), or designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). Finally, we iteratively rebuild our fusogen using insights from protein engineering to improve titers, or potency. By serially swapping different targeting scaffolds we believe we can target multiple different cell surface receptors, giving us the ability to target many different cell types. 
 Re-targeting the specificity of the G-protein is a challenging protein engineering problem, since altering the protein structure directly impacts all aspects of biological function. However, once we have achieved the desired specificity and potency for a certain cell type, we have the ability to deliver a variety of payloads to that cell. This feature of the technology should allow us to create multiple therapies targeting a variety of diseases with each successful fusogen. As a result, we believe success with any initial therapy targeting a given cell type could meaningfully advance lead candidate selection for other indications and increases our confidence that we will be successful with subsequent therapies targeting that same cell type. For example, a successful hepatocyte-targeting fusogen applied to a fusosome for a given monogenic liver disease meaningfully accelerates lead candidate selection and increases our confidence that we will be successful with subsequent therapies targeting hepatocytes. 
 41



Addressing key in vivo cell engineering challenges 
 We believe that our in vivo cell engineering platform enables us to address key challenges associated with successful in vivo cell engineering – payload delivery, genome modification, and execution in manufacturing: 
 Payload delivery 
 High cell specificity for diverse cell types. We believe we can engineer fusogens with cell specificity to maximize on-target effects, while reducing or eliminating off-target risk. In our research, we have used fusogens to successfully target numerous cell surface receptors and cell types. As an example, in preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that our fusogens can specifically target CD8, CD4, or CD3 T cells (see the subsection titled “Our in vivo Cell Engineering Pipeline—T cell Fusosome Program”), potentially enabling delivery of a payload in vivo to transduce specific T cell populations and enabling targeted cell killing through the creation of CAR T cells. 
 42

Engineering Fusogens to Target a Variety of Cell Types 
 

Figure A depicts the increased transduction efficiency (measured in titer) of a fusogen engineered for targeting CD20 on receptor enriched B cells as compared to B cells that were negative for the receptor. Similar transduction efficiency was also observed in an engineered fusogen targeting a neuronal surface protein, GRIA4, as depicted in Figure B. Neuronal-specific transduction of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) payload in the murine hippocampal region was observed using a fusosome specific for GRIA4 when injected into the hippocampal space (as depicted by the green coloring in Figure D) compared to widespread transduction when using a VSV-G fusogen (Figure C). Confirmation of neuron-specific targeting of the fusogen can be observed by the colocalization of GFP positive cells (green, Figure E) with the presence of a neuron-specific protein (NeuN in red, Figure F) and considering the high degree of overlap (colocalization seen as yellow, Figure G). Figures C-G from Anliker et al, Nature Methods, 2010. 
 Broad volume of distribution. Our SanaX business unit is actively working on next generation approaches to broaden the volume of distribution, including exploring cells as fusosome delivery vehicles. 
 Immunogenicity. We have initially focused our efforts on selecting fusogens for which the general population does not have pre-existing immunity. We are also working with a number of fusogens that exist naturally in humans, as neither these native fusogens nor re-targeted versions are likely to induce an immune response, making re-dosing more readily attainable. 
 43

Genome modification 
 High degree of payload flexibility. We have successfully delivered a variety of payloads including DNA, RNA, and proteins, using viral delivery methods and have used cells engineered to express specific fusogens to deliver organelles to a broad range of target cells. We believe this provides us the opportunity to potentially intervene in a wide range of human diseases. 
 Diverse Payload Delivery via Fusosomes 
 
Cre protein loaded cell-based fusosomes delivered recombinase activity to cells that activated the expression of a red fluorescent protein in cells already expressing green fluorescent protein, seen as orange cells (Figures A, B). In contrast, fusosomes in which the fusogen is not included, but only contain Cre protein, showed no recombinase activity, or no orange cells (Figure C). Fusosomes loaded with fluorescently labeled RNA showed cellular localization and green fluorescence consistent with cytoplasmic delivery and translation of delivered RNA (Figures D-G). Flow cytometric analysis showed cellular uptake of fluorescent RNA (Cy5, Y axis) and GFP expression from the RNA (GFP, X axis) (Figure H). Importantly, the inclusion of a fusogen in the fusosome dramatically increased GFP expression due to the translation of the RNA. Cell-based fusosomes delivered red fluorescent mitochondria with respiration activity to cells with respiration-negative green mitochondria, (Rho0 cells) shown in Figure I. An increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), due to respiration, was seen in Rho0 cells after Fusosome-mediated delivery of active mitochondria using two distinct fusogens (Figure J). 
 Expanded payload capacity. Our current fusosome has approximately twice the genetic capacity of the commonly used AAV vectors. This greater payload size increases the potential of addressing defects in larger genes or conditions where delivery of multiple genes may be required. Our research efforts include other fusosomes with even larger payload capacities. For example, utilizing a cell as the delivery vehicle can confer an almost limitless capacity. 
 Durability limitations. We can engineer our fusosomes to integrate into the target cell genome or to deliver non-integrating payloads. Integrated payloads allow the genetic information transmitted by the vector to be propagated durably with the genetic material of the target cell when it undergoes cell division. Thus, conditions that require this type of genetic propagation, such as genetic diseases in essential genes functioning in growing tissues or in T cells expanding after recognizing a target antigen, can be better addressed by this approach. Our preclinical studies have also demonstrated the ability to deliver gene-editing machinery, such as CRISPR, with this system. In this case, the entire payload does not integrate, but instead, it transiently delivers the machinery to 
 44

permanently modify the DNA in the target cell. Thus, we are able to make targeted, specific, and durable repairs to the genome of the target cell. 
 Execution in Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing of cell and gene therapies remains complex due to incumbent challenges in areas such as product consistency, process robustness, and scalability. Our fusosome approach has significant advantages over current solutions. Targeted delivery of complex payloads in vivo has the potential to create autologous, gene-modified cells without the complexities of ex vivo manufacturing. We believe that these therapies have the potential to have greater product consistency, improved scale, and lower costs than current autologous solutions. Currently, there are a number of therapies either approved or in development for ex vivo modification of autologous T cells and autologous HSCs. Additionally, vectors that deliver payload to random or off target cells not only create the risk for toxicities, but they necessitate meaningfully larger doses in order to ensure adequate delivery to the targeted cells. Our targeted delivery offers the potential for meaningfully lower doses, which could decrease scale needs in manufacturing. 
 Further, we are investing across a number of areas to improve manufacturing scale, costs, consistency, and product quality in the near-term and long-term, including by establishing and maintaining our relationships with our CDMO partners and investing in establishing and operating our own GMP manufacturing facility. Manufacturing novel fusosome compositions is complex. Since our inception, we have invested in scientific and process engineering expertise to improve manufacturing of our therapies. Examples include novel producer cell lines, novel processes and analytical technology, as well as incorporating suspension bioreactors into our process early in the research phase. By building out these capabilities early, we hope to improve the probability of technical success for our programs and have a thoughtful approach to deliver consistent supply while managing cost of goods with the goal of improving patient access. 
 Our in vivo Cell Engineering Pipeline 
 T Cell Fusosome Program (SG242, SG295, SG233, SG221, SG239)
 Our most advanced CAR T cell fusosome product candidates (SG242, SG295) target CD19+ cancer cells, including NHL, CLL, and ALL. We intend to develop these product candidates with the goal of submitting an IND as early as 2022. In parallel with the CD19 CAR product candidates we are developing other CAR T cell therapies, including BCMA product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma (SG221, SG239), CD22 product candidates for the treatment of NHL, CLL, and ALL (SG233), as well as other targets on a spectrum of cancers. 
Background on B Cell Malignancies 
 B cell malignancies represent a spectrum of cancers including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma (MM) and result in over 100,000 deaths per year in the United States and Europe. 
 NHL is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system. NHL is not a single disease, but rather a group of several closely related cancers. Over 77,000 cases of NHL are diagnosed annually in the United States and the most common subtype of NHL overall is diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL, if left untreated, may have survival measured in weeks or months. 
 CLL is the most common type of leukemia, and it occurs most frequently in older individuals, with diagnoses in people under 30 years of age occurring only rarely. Each year, approximately 20,000 patients are diagnosed with CLL in the United States. Approximately 20–25% of CLL patients initially present with poor risk disease. Median progression-free survival in these high-risk groups is often less than 12 to 18 months after frontline therapy, and less than 12 months in R/R disease. 
 ALL is an uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, which are immature white blood cells. The lymphoblasts, which are produced in the bone marrow, cause damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells. Approximately 6,000 patients are diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year, the vast majority of the approximately 1,500 deaths per year occur in adults. Approximately 80% of cases of ALL in the United States and Europe are B cell ALL, which almost always express the CD19 protein. The five-year overall survival in adults over the age of 60 with ALL is approximately 20%, and in patients with R/R ALL after two or more lines of therapy, the median disease-free survival is less than six months. B cell ALL is the most common cancer in children. Although children with ALL fare better than adults, children with R/R disease have poor outcomes. Because of the frequency, ALL remains a leading cause of death due to cancer in children. 
 Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells, which typically express a protein called B Cell Maturational Antigen (BCMA). Plasma cells are B cells that have matured to specialize in the production of antibodies. Multiple myeloma is a condition in which these plasma cells become malignant, with a single clone growing at an uncontrolled pace. These myeloma cells secrete large 
 45

quantities of the same antibody, and patient symptoms can develop from the myeloma cells crowding out other plasma and bone marrow cells, leading to increased risk of infection, risk of bone destruction, and kidney disease. Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic malignancy making up approximately 2% of all cancers, accounting for over 32,000 new cases per year with 12,800 deaths estimated to occur in 2020 in the United States. 
 Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 First line therapy for NHL typically consists of multi-agent cytotoxic drugs in combination with the monoclonal antibody Rituxan. In younger patients with NHL who have good organ function, high dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation is often used. Patients often relapse, however, and over the last three years, several therapeutics have been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with R/R NHL who have received prior therapies. These approved therapies include CD19 CAR T therapies tisagenlecleucel, axicabtagene ciloleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel, CD19 antibody drug conjugate therapy polatuzumab vedotin, and CD19 antibody tafasitamab. Recently, pivotal trials with approved CD19 CAR T cells have been shown to be superior to standard of care approaches in patients in second line R/R NHL raising the possibility of broader impact for CD19 CAR T cells for patients with NHL.
 Newly diagnosed CLL patients are often treated with targeted therapies such as BTK inhibitors, PIK3 inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, or monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20, or CD52 in combination with chemotherapy. However, most patients treated with these regimens become refractory. Numerous drug candidates are in clinical development for the refractory patients, including next-generation kinase inhibitors and both autologous and allogeneic CAR T therapies targeting CD20 and CD19. 
 Cure rates for ALL patients have continued to increase over the last four decades, with pediatric ALL cure rates reaching greater than 80% in developed countries. This progress has been enabled by advances in combination chemotherapy, monitoring of minimal residual disease, expanded use of kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome–positive ALL, and the recent approval of Kymriah for R/R pediatric ALL. Adult patients fare much worse, however, with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 20%, and there are still significant challenges managing R/R disease across all age groups. Multiple therapeutic candidates are in development for these R/R patients, including proteasome inhibitors, antimetabolites, JAK inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, as well as autologous and allogeneic CAR T candidates. 
 First-line therapy for MM is induction and high-dose chemotherapy followed by a potential stem cell transplant. There are no curative treatment options for MM patients and the standard of care for R/R MM includes immunomodulary agents, proteasome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic agents, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Despite the recent advancement in available therapies for disease management, the 5-year overall survival rate remains approximately 50%. To this end, several groups are investigating autologous and allogeneic CAR T cell therapies for R/R MM. BCMA is among the most promising antigens used to target MM, with two approved BCMA CAR T therapies idecabtagene vicleucel, and ciltacabtagene autoleucel, as well as multiple late-stage clinical trials ongoing. Novel treatments with other mechanisms of action are also under development, including bispecific T cell engagers, next-gen antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates.
 As highlighted above, recent therapeutic advances across R/R B cell malignancies have led to a variety of treatment options and better patient outcomes. In particular, autologous surface protein directed CAR T therapies have been highly effective in certain subsets of patients with R/R disease. However, not all patients have access to novel therapies, and even with them, many patients will ultimately relapse and succumb to their cancer, resulting in 100,000 deaths per year in the United States and Europe across these indications. 
 There are two outstanding challenges that have limited utilization of these CAR T therapies and their impact on broader groups of patients. 
 Relapse. The emerging post-approval data with tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel have indicated that there are two broad categories of relapse. One involves loss of CD19 on malignant cells resulting in tumor escape. This finding was initially established for ALL and is the cause of relapse after CAR T cells for roughly half of patients. More recent data indicate that low antigen expression contributes to the lack of response in a meaningful number of patients with NHL. CD19 CAR T treatments have recently been tested in pivotal trials in earlier lines of therapy for NHL, which raises the possibility of more patients being treated with CD19 CAR T therapy who subsequently relapse due to CD19 loss.  Therefore, the development of CAR Ts targeting an alternate antigen beyond CD19 may be beneficial to address this growing unmet need. Data from several studies have shown that CD22 CAR T treatment has led to complete responses in NHL and ALL patients that have failed to reach a complete response or relapsed after treatment with a CD19 CAR T cell product. Additionally, dual targeting of CD19 and CD22 as the initial form of treatment may prevent this form of relapse, offering patients the potential for both a higher rate and longer duration of complete response. The second pattern of relapse relates to suboptimal CAR T cell functionality (poor expansion, poor persistence, T cell exhaustion) resulting in relapse of cancer that retains the targeted antigen. Unfortunately, re-infusion of the same CAR T cell product has had limited benefit 
 46

in these patients although treatment with a different CAR T cell has demonstrated some promise in the context of ongoing clinical trials. 
 Manufacturing. The manufacturing process for a patient-specific product is complex, leading to limited access due to both infrastructure and cost considerations. As such, approved CAR T cell therapies have not been available to all patients in need of these highly effective therapies. Even for patients who are fortunate enough to have access, inevitable delays (often a month or more) in manufacturing may prevent use of therapy in patients with rapidly progressing malignancies. There are groups that are seeking to overcome access limitations by using healthy donor-derived, or allogeneic, CAR T cells instead of patient T cells. This approach yields off-the-shelf therapeutics that can be manufactured consistently, but questions remain around efficacy and durability, largely due to the inability to effectively control the host versus graft response with concern for eventual rejection of these products. As will be discussed in the subsection titled “—Our ex vivo Cell Engineering Pipeline,” our ex vivo allogeneic T cell program also seeks to address this host versus graft response. 
 T Cell Fusosome Program 
 Our T cell fusosome approach provides us with an opportunity to develop potential product candidates to expand access to CAR T cell therapy to many more patients in need. In addition, we believe the ability to deliver a payload encoding a CAR to a T cell inside the body has the potential to improve effectiveness over ex vivo manufactured CAR T cell products. Experience thus far has demonstrated that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells contribute to the CAR T cell response. Thus, the fusosome programs we are developing will deliver the CAR gene using fusogens that directly and specifically target the CD8 co-receptor or the CD4 co-receptor on T cells following a single intravenous injection. These approaches could result in the generation of therapeutically active CAR T cells without the complexities and delays associated with the process of T cell collection and ex vivo manufacturing. Furthermore, the ex vivo expansion in the presence of high cytokine concentrations, while necessary for the manufacture of approved CAR T cell products, also contributes to marked changes in T cell quality that may not be therapeutically beneficial. We believe the generation of a CAR T cell within the natural physiological environment has the potential to improve the quality of the CAR T cell generated, potentially improving both efficacy and the side effect profile. Finally, the effectiveness of ex vivo manufactured CAR T cells is dependent on the administration of a lymphodepleting preparative regimen prior to infusion to facilitate expansion of the CAR T cell product, which can have meaningful adverse safety implications. We do not expect to need a lymphodepleting regimen prior to in vivo delivery of the CAR gene, as our goal is to expose our fusosomes to as many T cells in the body as possible. 
 Preclinical Data 
 Our preclinical data have demonstrated that fusosomes can deliver a genetic payload specifically and efficiently to human T cells in culture and in immunodeficient mice with intraperitoneally injected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and fused with a single dose of a fusosome. The T cells can be categorized into functional subsets based on the expression pattern of cell surface molecules. CD3 is a protein expressed on all T cells, CD4 is expressed on the Helper T cells that primarily activate T and B cells to carry out their function, and CD8 is found on cytotoxic T cells that primarily kill cancerous or virally infected cells. We generated fusogens against these three cell-surface molecules and have demonstrated that we can deliver a marker gene to cells bearing these cell surface proteins in vitro. 
 47

Fusogens Demonstrate the Ability to Target Multiple T Cell Subtypes 
 
Fusosomes containing a gene that encodes a fluorescent marker protein called GFP (used to identify cells have been genetically modified by the fusogen) can efficiently and specifically deliver GFP to T cells in culture (CD8, CD4, and CD3). Expression of GFP is restricted to the population of T cells that express the specific T cell receptor targeted by the fusogen (CD8, CD4, or CD3). 
 48

We have further established that fusosome delivery of a CD19 CAR gene to CD4 or CD8 T cells results in killing of human B cells and CD19+ leukemia cells in culture: 
 Delivery of CD19 CAR to CD4 T Cells Leads to in vitro Killing of B Cells and CD19+ Leukemia Cells 
 
Demonstrates that the fusosome-generated CD4 CAR is functional and eradicates both nonmalignant B cells (CD19+/RFP-) as well as CD19+ leukemia cells expressing NALM6-RFP. 
 We have also validated, in vivo, the tumor-killing activity of CD8 T cells to which CD19 CAR has been delivered via a fusosome. 
 49

Delivery of CD19 CAR to CD8 Cells Leads to in vivo Killing of Leukemia Cells in a Human Xenograft Mouse Model 
 
Left panel: demonstrates activity of CD8 fusosome delivering CD19 CAR to human T cells in a murine leukemia xenograft model (Nalm-6). Note that when compared to untreated controls, fusosome delivery results in eradication of leukemia cells. Activated T cells were cultured with CD3/CD28 beads for 3 days prior to injection. CD8 fusosome delivering the CD19 CAR is effective regardless of activation status of T cells at time of injection. Right panel: represents quantification of luminescence (representing leukemic burden) from mice shown in left panel. Both cohorts of fusosome treated mice had significantly reduced tumor burden when compared to control as early as D10 (p≤.0001; One-way ANOVA Bonnferroni) Experimental note: Tumors injected on Day Zero, Donor T cells injected on Day Three and Fusosome injected on Day Four. 
 Using a human xenograft mouse model for leukemia (Nalm-6), we observed both prolonged survival and clearance of the leukemic cells. During the manufacture of autologous CAR Ts, cytokine signaling has to be activated in order to successfully produce functional CAR T cells. In our mouse experiments the CD8 fusosome was able to generate CD19 CAR cells just as effectively with activated as non-activated donor T cells. 
 Several of our human T cell fusogens cross-react on non-human primate (NHP) T cells including our lead candidate CD8 fusogen. We have used the fusogen to deliver a CD20 CAR into six NHPs (the CD20 CAR was chosen as the CD19 CAR to be used for our clinical programs does not cross-react with NHP B cells). As shown below, a single intravenous administration of our CD8 fusogen containing a CD20 CAR was associated with B cell depletion, including in the blood and in lymph nodes, in four out of six NHPs, occurring between day seven and fourteen. This result is consistent with reported observations that peak expansion of ex vivo manufactured CAR T cells typically occurs during the second week. Serum cytokines were transiently elevated at day seven in all fusosome-treated animals. CD20 CAR transgene (by vector copy number) and CD20 CAR mRNA could be detected in peripheral blood between days three to ten, and in the spleen at study termination. Importantly, there was no infusion-related toxicity or evidence for CAR-associated toxicity (cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity) other than the intended B cell depletion. The ability to deliver fusogen without toxicity and with evidence for activity in NHP are critical milestones for the program. In addition, the NHPs received no T cell activating agent or lymphodepletion. The latter potentially supports a path for the fusogen platform to enable delivery of CAR therapy without the lymphodepletion regimens used by existing ex vivo approaches, which have toxic side-effects. This and future NHP experiments will also provide important information on dosing parameters, durability of the effect, and provide pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicology data. 
 50

Delivery of CD20 CAR to CD8 Cells Causes B Cell Depletion in NHPs 
 
Graph demonstrates activity of CD8 fusosome delivering CD20 CAR in NHPs. CD8 fusosome was delivered as a single intravenous infusion. B cell counts were quantified in peripheral blood using flow cytometry for CD20+ cells. Given expected NHP-to-NHP variability in baseline counts, data is represented as single lines per NHP and is shown as deviation from baseline level for each NHP at Day Fourteen (when maximal expansion of CAR T cells are expected). Significant B cell depletion is observed in four out of six NHPs. Note that no T cell activation was provided prior to fusosome delivery. 
 Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 We are currently conducting experiments to validate the ability of a systemically administered fusosome to transduce T cells in an NHP and for these CAR T cells to deplete B cells. These NHP studies are also expected to inform preclinical pharmacology and toxicology. 
 As a next step, we intend to conduct our in-life GLP toxicology studies. While these studies are ongoing, we intend to scale our GMP manufacturing and finalize our initial development plan. We intend to submit an IND for SG295 to support clinical trials in patients with NHL in 2022. We continue to advance additional programs and plan to submit INDs over the next several years: SG242 in NHL, SG233 which delivers a CAR gene targeting CD22 and could be combined with targeting CD19, and our BCMA programs in MM. 
 Hepatocyte Fusosome Program 
 Numerous genetic metabolic diseases arise from gene defects that manifest in the liver and, in particular, in the hepatocyte. Additionally, hepatocytes can serve as protein manufacturing sites to deliver proteins to other cells in the body. Multiple modalities exist that enable delivery of genetic material to liver cells, including AAV and LNPs. However, these approaches have limitations, including non-integrating payloads, payload size, lack of cell specificity, and, in the case of AAV, immunogenicity. Our fusogen technology, which we expect will be able to deliver a payload specifically to hepatocytes in the liver, has the potential to address these limitations. Success with this hepatocyte-targeting technology may allow us to generate therapies for a number of genetic disorders. We are developing our lead product candidate, SG328, for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, and we expect to submit an IND in the next several years. 
Hepatocyte Targeting Capability 
 Targeting the hepatocyte with a fusogen can enable specific delivery of either integrating or non-integrating payloads. It can also be used to deliver the machinery of gene editing and gene modification tools to these cells, both with or without the inclusion of DNA to replace a mutated gene or gene fragment. Since we anticipate that hepatocytes transduced with fusosomes will harbor the novel genetic construct in their genome, all progeny of that cell will also have the genetic construct. Thus, the natural turnover and organ growth will not dilute the genetic construct, providing the potential for long-term expression and efficacy even when the 
 51

fusosome is delivered during infancy, childhood, or when it is delivered to treat a disease where the disorder can cause rapid hepatocyte turnover. 
 We believe that success with an initial hepatocyte-targeted fusosome will meaningfully accelerate our future hepatocyte programs. Once a hepatocyte-targeting fusosome is established, our subsequent programs will require only substituting the relevant payload to correct for the defective gene in question, opening up the possibility to address multiple inherited liver diseases. Our initial focus is on monogenic diseases with clear biology linking the missing activity of a gene in hepatocytes to a disease outcome. According to the National Institute of Health, over 30 genetic disorders of the liver exist, impacting over 10,000 births annually around the world. Many of these disorders lead to death in the first few years or cause long term disabilities. Proof of concept within this set of initial diseases will enable expansion to other diseases, such as hemophilia, where we may be able to address an unmet need by providing a durable in vivo therapy in the hepatocyte.
Preclinical Data 
 Our ability to use our hepatocyte-targeting fusosomes in relevant animal models is limited by a lack of cross-species transduction. To address this, we first developed murine disease models and introduced the therapeutic payload utilizing a conventional lentivirus pseudotyped with VSV-G. The VSV-G fusogen targets the LDL receptor which is highly expressed in hepatocytes providing a potent in vivo delivery vehicle for hepatocytes. These models established proof of concept to treat these diseases through genomic integration of the corrected gene as well as transduction efficiency in the range that would be needed for efficacy. However, the LDL receptor is found on a significant number of other cell types resulting in extensive off-target transduction. We do not intend to move forward with this non-specific lentivirus construct, as its lack of specificity creates potential challenges in humans. However, it does provide a preclinical model system for us to understand the percentage of hepatocytes, as well as the expression level of the novel genetic material that are required for the intended therapeutic effect. 
 In parallel, we have developed and improved hepatocyte-specific fusosomes for high on target transduction efficiency (as measured by titer), with the goal of achieving potency comparable to or better than what we see with conventional lentivirus. Engineering of hepatocyte specificity is generated through the choice of target receptor selectively expressed in human hepatocytes. Through an iterative process focusing on multiple hepatocyte-selective cell surface protein targets, diverse binders, and protein engineering, we have developed constructs that have met our potency goals. We have tested these constructs in vivo in mouse models and shown that they can transduce human hepatocytes at levels comparable to conventional lentivirus with significantly lower frequency of off-target transduction. Furthermore, the transduction occurs in a dose-dependent manner. 
 52

Improved Targeted Fusogens Exhibit High in vitro Transduction of Primary Human Hepatocytes (PHHs) 
 
Improved hepatocyte-targeted fusosomes show levels of in vitro transduction similar to conventional lentivirus. Protein engineering of Fusogen 1b resulted in new sets of fusogens with significantly increased titer on PHHs. The most potent of these fusosomes approach the hepatocyte titer of conventional lentivirus. 
 53

Improved Targeted Fusogens Can Transduce Hepatocytes in vivo in a Humanized Liver Mouse (FRG) at Comparable Levels to Conventional Lentivirus and in a Dose-Dependent Fashion 
 
Hepatocyte-targeted fusosomes show levels of in vivo transduction similar to conventional lentivirus and dose dependence. Fusosomes were delivered by intravenous injection (tail vein) into humanized liver mice (FRG, or FAH- immunodeficient mice, repopulated with primary human hepatocytes). Dose for lentivirus was 1.4 1011 TU/kg (# of transducing units per kilogram mouse body weight, tested on primary human hepatocytes). Highest dose for the hepatocyte-targeted fusosome was 1.1 1010 TU/kg (1X) and lower doses were at one-third (0.33X) and one-tenth (0.1X) of the highest dose. Liver cells were harvested from injected mice seven days after injection, separated into hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells (non-hepatocytes) and analyzed for GFP expression and species (human or mouse). 
 Background on OTC Deficiency 
 OTC deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of the urea cycle, the process by which the body detoxifies ammonia and produces urea. It is the only urea cycle disorder that is X-linked, leading to more severe disease in males. OTC deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 births, and there are approximately 10,000 patients worldwide. A deficiency of the OTC enzyme leads to accumulation of ammonia, which can lead to neurotoxicity manifesting early as vomiting and anorexia, before progressing to a progressive lethargy, seizures, intellectual impairment, coma, and death. The severity and age of onset of OTC deficiency can vary with the most severely affected, typically males, presenting shortly after birth. In this severe, neonatal onset of OTC deficiency, patients present with an overwhelming illness that rapidly progresses with up to 90% mortality rate despite advances in standard of care treatments. In less severely affected patients who present later in childhood or as adults, severe elevations of ammonia and resulting neurotoxicity still occur, primarily precipitated by an illness or excessive protein intake. 
 OTC Deficiency: Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 The standard of care for patients with OTC deficiency includes a low protein diet, nutrient supplementation, and the use of ammonia scavengers such as benzoate, phenylacetate, or phenylbutyrate. Despite all of these measures, patients may still experience acute hyperammonemia crises particularly in the setting of increased protein catabolism that can be induced by viral illness or certain medications. These acute crises are treated with supportive care including kidney dialysis for rapid ammonia reduction. The frequency and duration of hyperammonemia crises has been directly linked to poor long-term outcomes and intellectual disability. The only curative therapy available is liver transplantation, which has become more common as surgical techniques and supportive care have improved over time. In those patients with severe, neonatal onset of OTC deficiency, liver transplantation is commonly performed before the age of five and, in some cases, can occur before one year of age. 
 In addition to the standard of care therapies noted above, therapies to replace the defective OTC gene have been pursued. Recent trials have primarily utilized AAVs to deliver a corrected OTC gene. While these viruses have to date been generally well tolerated, they are still associated with significant immunogenicity that can preclude use in the up to one third of patients with pre-existing antibodies to AAV and can lead to systemic symptoms, including elevated liver enzymes. Beyond the challenge of pre-existing antibodies, the primary drawback is the potential for transient efficacy as the gene replacement via AAV would not be expected to be 
 54

permanent if replication of the target cell occurs. While the durability of an AAV delivered gene replacement for OTC deficiency depends on many factors, one of the key determinants is the rate of hepatocyte turnover. This is especially relevant in pediatric patients with growing livers and rapid cell turnover. This dilution of effect has been supported by animal studies where AAV delivered gene replacement was successful in adult animals but not successful in younger animals. The most severe form of OTC deficiency presents in the neonatal period and, if a donor is available, may be treated with liver transplantation, a permanent gene therapy that provides long lasting benefit to patients is required to address the greatest unmet need from OTC deficiency. Additionally, as hepatocytes continue to divide approximately once a year even in adults, a durable gene therapy would also be expected to provide an advantage even in adult patients where an AAV delivered gene therapy is likely to lose function over time. 
 We believe our approach of pursuing a permanent gene replacement therapy has the potential to improve morbidity, mortality, and quality of life even in the youngest, most severely ill patients. 
 Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 We are conducting mouse studies to establish proof of concept and inform the dose profile of our lead hepatocyte fusosome. In the near term, we are seeking to finalize the hepatocyte-targeted fusosome candidate and begin GLP production. Dose and safety of our lead fusosome compositions for OTC will be further informed through NHP studies, and with success, we expect to submit an IND in the next several years. The hepatocytes of the liver are the one cell type readily accessible to competing technologies such as AAVs and LNPs. Each of these technologies has limitations overcome by the fusosome platform, but any future investment in therapeutics targeting hepatocytes will need to consider if these fusosome advantages are meaningful enough to patients to justify the investment. For example, we are currently evaluating whether our technology offers differentiated solutions to these liver-targeted gene therapies for genetic diseases such as Hemophilia and Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. 
HSC Fusosome Program 
 We are developing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) targeted fusosomes, designed to target and repair genetic abnormalities underlying diseases such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia (SG418), with the goal of achieving preclinical proof of concept as early as 2023. 
 Background on hemoglobinopathies 
 Devastating inherited hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and other hemoglobinopathies, are caused by a monogenic variant, and patients suffering from these diseases are candidates for in vivo cell engineering. 
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a single point mutation in the beta globin gene (HbB). The resulting mutant form of the protein, referred to as HbS, is prone to aggregate into long, rigid molecules that deform red blood cells (RBCs) into a sickle shape, obstructing blood vessels and undergoing premature lysis. The consequences are severe pain (sickle cell crisis), tissue infarction, infection, anemia, stroke, and early death. SCD is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting an estimated 100,000 individuals, and 134,000 individuals in Europe. The global prevalence of SCD is estimated to be approximately 4.4 million individuals and is most common among people of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. 
 Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by any one of over 200 mutations in HbB which results in reduced production of functional hemoglobin. Transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDBT) is the most severe form of this disease, often requiring multiple transfusions per year. Patients with TDBT suffer from failure to thrive, persistent infections, and life-threatening anemia. Frequent blood transfusions can lead to iron overload that then require iron chelation therapy, which itself is associated with significant toxicities, resulting in low levels of adherence. Even with frequent transfusions, patients with TDBT continue to suffer from failure to thrive, persistent infections, and life-threatening anemia. 
 The prevalence of beta-thalassemia globally is estimated to be 288,000. The total combined prevalence of beta-thalassemia in the United States and Europe is estimated to be approximately 19,000 patients, mostly in Europe. Of the patients currently treated in the United States and Europe, we believe approximately 50% and 10%, respectively, are transfusion dependent. Beta-thalassemia is especially prevalent in developing countries of Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. Although historically prevalent in Mediterranean North Africa and South Asia, thalassemias are now encountered in other regions as a result of changing migration patterns. As such, there is a growing focus on developing new therapeutics aimed at improving quality of life for this significant unmet medical need. 
 Correction of the causal monogenic defects could potentially provide a one-time, curative treatment approach, rather than the current lifelong, multidisciplinary standard of care treatment. 
 55

Current Treatment Landscape and Unmet Need 
 Despite its clear and well-known genetic nature, SCD remains underserved, with existing treatment strategies mostly supportive in nature. Allogeneic HSC transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only potentially curative therapy available. However, HSCT is limited by donor availability (approximately 15-30% worldwide). 
 Furthermore, chronic graft-versus-host disease is a major risk that contributes to the long-term morbidities associated with allogeneic HSCT. Otherwise, treatment options largely manage disease symptoms, including analgesia during crises, hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, and anti-infectives. Recently, two disease-modifying treatments were approved by the FDA, crizanlizumab and voxelotor. Crizanlizumab was approved for treating crises in SCD patients who are unresponsive to either hydroxyurea or L-glutamine. Voxelotor is an oral small molecule inhibitor of HbS polymerization, which compared to placebo, was associated with a reduction in acute crises. While these agents represent a meaningful advance in the treatment of SCD, they focus on supportive care and do not address the mutation in the gene that is the root cause of the disease. 
 As in SCD, there are limited treatment options available for TDBT, and those that exist are supportive in nature. Allogeneic HSCT is similarly potentially curative but is also limited by donor availability, the risk of GVHD, and other comorbidities that result from the procedure. Because of the need for recurring blood transfusions, patients require ongoing chelation therapy to avoid iron load from the transfusions and its associated organ damage. However, this treatment is burdensome and associated with significant toxicities, and consequently, has low adherence. Currently, there is only one FDA approved therapy for beta-thalassemia, luspatercept, which significantly reduces the frequency of blood transfusions needed. However, safety concerns remain with a possible increased risk for hypertension and thromboembolic events. 
 There are several therapies in development to treat diseases of the hematopoietic system that have demonstrated clinical proof of concept through ex vivo gene modification. These approaches directly address the genetic activity missing in SCD and TDBT by supplying a novel gene to the patient’s cell or by editing genome to enhance hemoglobin expression. The ex vivo process begins with the mobilization and removal of cells from the blood, a process known as leukapheresis. Next, these cells undergo a process to enrich for cells expressing an HSC marker, CD34. The enrichment of CD34 cells increases the percentage of long-lived HSCs, the key stem cell that is both persistent and can differentiate into all the cells of the blood. However, even under enrichment, long-lived HSCs make up less than 1% of all the CD34 cells. CD34+ cells are transduced with either a novel gene or genome editing complexes, each having a distinct therapeutic action. The cells are then cryopreserved and sent back to the patient. Before transplantation, the patients receive conditioning chemotherapy to prepare the body so that the gene-modified cells engraft after re-infusion. The current conditioning regimens are toxic, with significant risks and side effects, although less toxic regimens are in development. Key questions remain regarding durability and safety, particularly over time, for transplanting these ex vivo modified HSCs. Furthermore, manufacturing complexities, cost, and the complications from the myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy regimens remain significant obstacles to widespread adoption. There are multiple ongoing efforts to improve this approach by focusing on HSC procurement, transduction, gene-editing, milder conditioning regimens, and transplantation efficiency. We believe that the most meaningful opportunity to improve outcomes is to eliminate the complex ex vivo modification and transplantation steps by utilizing our fusogen technology to develop fusosomes that specifically target HSC and other key hematopoietic cells via in vivo delivery. 
 Our HSC Fusosome Approach 
 The use of an in vivo fusosome-based delivery system bypasses the requirement for ex vivo manufacturing and would require no conditioning chemotherapy. Without the manufacturing complexity and the requisite hospital stay for a patient who has undergone conditioning, as well as the concomitant costs and risks of each, in vivo therapies have the potential to meaningfully increase the number of patients that receive these therapies. 
 Targeting HSCs in vivo using fusogens requires identifying the appropriate cells and their corresponding cell surface receptors. HSCs have no single specific marker, but there are a number of cell surface proteins that are highly enriched on HSCs. Some of these markers also appear on erythrocytic, or red blood cell, progenitors, which may help establish both short-term and long-term efficacy. We have an ongoing program to discover fusogens with appropriate target specificity. 
 In parallel, we are establishing our capability to deliver different payloads utilizing the fusosome system. Our goal is to establish the appropriate cell specificity with the ability to utilize the appropriate gene modification system to achieve the right outcome for patients. With successful cell-specific targeting, we have an opportunity to deliver the therapeutic payload to the right cell without the need for complex ex vivo manufacturing or toxic conditioning chemotherapy. 
 56

Development Plan and Key Next Steps 
 The next major milestones are to identify candidate fusogens for specific HSC targeting and fusosome compositions with relevant genome modification payloads. Our goal is to achieve preclinical proof of concept for SG418 as early as 2023 and submit an IND in the next several years. 
 SanaX 
 Despite the significant advances in the development of successful cell and gene therapies that have been made to date, there remain a number of fundamental limitations of existing technologies that prevent achieving the maximal breadth of application of these new therapeutic approaches. We wish to lead both the present and future of cell and gene therapy, and we are therefore committed to investing in research and other activities that will ensure a leadership position for the long-term. Towards this end, we have established SanaX as a distinct research arm. 
 In contrast to the industry’s traditional research activities which are focused primarily on near-term product development using existing technologies, SanaX is devoted to finding solutions to the limitations of today’s technology in order to expand the breadth of therapeutic opportunities. SanaX research efforts are aimed at making fundamental improvements to existing technologies and establishing new paradigms for gene and cell delivery that will ultimately lead to the development of completely new therapeutic modalities. 
 Truly novel technology development requires the unique ability to thoughtfully marry rigorous experimental science with specific technical goals. Often, fundamental biological problems must be understood in depth in order to define the pathway to a new technological and therapeutic capability. SanaX has established a unique physical and cultural environment with individuals that possess the requisite intellectual and technical capabilities essential for success. One characteristic of the SanaX research environment that we believe will be extremely valuable is a “nimbleness” that enables the team to immediately embrace new technical or scientific information and/or meet specific unanticipated therapeutic needs. In addition, several collaborative efforts with outside investigators possessing specific biological sector expertise have been established to enhance our internal efforts. 
 Current SanaX research activities are focused in several areas where we believe advances in technology are most critical. Some of these efforts include: 
  
• | evaluating the use of cells, rather than viruses, as delivery vehicles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | re-purposing several different virus vector systems and virus-like particles (VLPs) to expand the therapeutic payloads that may be delivered by the different viruses and VLPs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing novel approaches to the production of different viral vectors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing novel methods for enabling the exogenous control of transgene expression via small molecule drugs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing new paradigms for genetically manipulating specific arms of the immune response in order to engender immunological tolerance to specific antigens, cells, and organs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COVID-19 related research focused on the delivery of specific anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies and the evaluation of novel direct anti-viral strategies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Dr. Mulligan, our Executive Vice-Chairman and Head of SanaX, directly oversees the SanaX research effort. SanaX maintains an independent research budget in order to ensure that these longer-term, disruptive priorities are not sacrificed for near-term needs. Once SanaX develops an understanding of how a technology can translate into the clinic, a program will move from SanaX into our internal R&D and manufacturing organization or partnered externally. 
 Manufacturing Strategy and Approach 
 While the field of cell and gene therapy has had a number of successes with innovative therapies, the challenges of manufacturing at industrial scale have limited access for patients in need. As was the case during the initial development of recombinant biologics, an improvement to our ability to characterize these products will be essential to increasing patient access. It is especially critical to have an in-depth understanding of the impact of manufacturing processes on the product quality attributes and resulting clinical performance of the product. 
 From inception, we have recognized the key role manufacturing plays in enabling the access of these innovative engineered cells as medicines. Two areas of particular focus are product analytical and biological characterization, leading to a better definition of critical product attributes, as well as process understanding, leading to better control the impact of process parameters on these critical product attributes. 
 57

We have developed a manufacturing strategy that supports our vision of democratizing access with early investments in people, technology, and infrastructure: 
  
• | establishing a team with diverse, experienced talents with extensive knowledge of both the process and analytical sciences in the field of cell and gene therapy, as well as CMC product development expertise from preclinical to global commercialization;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishing multiple manufacturing platforms for our diverse portfolio; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishing infrastructure from lab bench to a GMP manufacturing and supply chain network.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To support our ex vivo and in vivo development pipeline, we are initially establishing three manufacturing platforms: viral vector, allogeneic T cells, and PSC-derived. 
 While the three manufacturing platforms are very different in terms of the manufacturing process and supply chain, they also share some common challenges and opportunities. For example, product characterization and analytical development are critical, and these capabilities are fungible across platforms. In addition, we are focusing on some of the key areas in each of the platforms to enable scaled manufacturing. For the viral vector platform, we are starting early in the research phase with suspension culture process in bioreactors similar to protein biologics to maximize process yield and batch to batch process robustness at scale. Transfer to these bioreactors later in development can complicate product comparability assessments. For the allogeneic T cell program, we are focusing on scaling the multiplex gene editing process and understanding of the impact of the variability of the starting material from healthy donors to on product quality. For stem-cell derived therapies, such as beta cells, cardiomyocytes, and glial progenitor cells, we are focusing on developing a scalable process and analytical technologies to characterize stability of the starting cells, end cell products, and critical product quality attributes. 
 To establish our manufacturing capability, we started with a non-GMP pilot plant for ex vivo and in vivo engineered cell platform processes with up to 200L bioreactor scale. This provides the infrastructure for process and technology development, technology transfer support, and production for non-GMP material such as GLP toxicology study material. In addition, we are taking a hybrid approach to establish our end-to-end supply chains for the three manufacturing platforms, leveraging a combination of internal manufacturing capability and external contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) for clinical supplies, in a staged manner: 
  
• | we will utilize CDMOs for GMP supplies initially to support our upcoming INDs and early-stage clinical trials; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we intend to build the internal manufacturing facilities needed to support late-stage clinical trials and commercialization of therapies across our pipeline.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Operating our own internal manufacturing facilities to complement our CDMO networks is a key to our strategy. Accordingly, in July 2021, we entered into a long-term lease to establish and operate our own GMP manufacturing facility to support our late-stage clinical development and early commercial product candidates across our product portfolio, including with the production of allogeneic T cells, viral vectors, and PSC-derived products. We believe that investing in an internal manufacturing facility will offer us a competitive advantage that will better position us to execute on our goal of ensuring broad and uninterrupted patient access to our therapies, including by allowing us to mitigate delays related to third-parties, including related to capacity-, personnel-, or production-related issues at our CDMOs; develop proprietary knowledge and product and process expertise we can utilize across our programs to create long-term value; and design a facility that can be optimized for and adaptable to our existing and future needs. 
 Competition 
 There are other companies that have stated that they are developing cell and gene therapies that may address oncology, diabetes, CNS disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and well-established marketing and salesforces, or may operate in jurisdictions where lower standards of evidence are required to bring products to market. For example, we are aware that some of our competitors, including Novartis International AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc.,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Novo Nordisk A/S, Johnson & Johnson, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Precision BioSciences, Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., Fate Therapeutics, Inc., Century Therapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., 2seventy bio, Inc., Orchard Therapeutics PLC, Aruvant Sciences, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Editas Medicine, Inc., Beam Therapeutics Inc. (Beam), ViaCyte Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, Eli Lilly and Company, Astellas Pharma Inc., and Bayer AG might be conducting large-scale clinical trials for therapies that could be competitive with our ex vivo and in vivo programs. Among companies pursuing ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering, we believe we are substantially differentiated by our robust intellectual property portfolio, extensive research, rigorous and objective approach, and multidisciplinary capabilities. 
 58

Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cell and gene therapy. We additionally plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available and, where applicable, plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents, and operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 We have in-licensed and developed numerous patents and patent applications, which include claims directed to compositions, methods of use, processes, dosing, and formulations, and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering platforms and related product candidates, including related manufacturing processes. As of February 2022, our in-licensed and owned patent portfolio consisted of approximately 41 licensed U.S. issued patents, approximately 78 licensed U.S. pending patent applications, and approximately 55 owned U.S. pending patent applications, as well as approximately 69 licensed patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States, approximately 326 licensed patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including approximately five licensed pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications), and approximately 42 owned patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including approximately 15 owned pending PCT applications) that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States in our portfolio are held primarily in Europe, Canada, China, Japan, and Australia. For information related to our in-licensed intellectual property, see the subsection below titled “—Key Intellectual Property Agreements.” 
 For the product candidates and related manufacturing processes we develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, process, dosing, and formulation patent protection. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing, drug development processes and technology, and our technology platforms. When available to expand our exclusivity, our strategy is to obtain or license additional intellectual property related to current or contemplated development platforms, core elements of technology, and/or product candidates. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States and in many jurisdictions worldwide have a term that extends to 20 years from the earliest nonprovisional filing date. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the Unites States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining and granting a patent counterbalanced by delays on the part of a patentee, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. In addition, in certain instances, the patent term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent terms extension, which recaptures a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the testing and regulatory review periods required by FDA. The patent term extension period cannot be longer than five years, and the total patent term, including the extension, cannot exceed 14 years following FDA approval; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and, if granted, the length of such extensions. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. Our patents issued as of February, 2022, have terms expected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2040. If patents are issued on our patent applications pending as of February, 2022, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2023 to 2043. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term, and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an 
 59

application. While we intend to timely file nonprovisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 We file U.S. nonprovisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows an applicant to file a single application within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application and to designate all of the 153 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications, and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing. 
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. We always consider the advice of counsel and our business model and needs. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any product candidates, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and product candidates, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims, to help ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our inventions given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be and typically are modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the fields of cell and gene therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and worldwide may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our patented product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, products, or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product candidate, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Patent disputes are sometimes interwoven into other business disputes.

As of February, 2022, our registered trademark portfolio contained approximately 25 registered trademarks and pending trademark applications, consisting of approximately two pending trademark applications in the United States, and approximately 13 registered trademarks and approximately ten pending trademark applications in the following countries through both national filings and under the Madrid Protocol: Australia, Canada, China, European Union, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland. 
 We may also rely, in some circumstances, on confidential information, including trade secrets, to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and products, see the subsection titled “Risk Factors —Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology.” 
 Key Intellectual Property Agreements 
 The following describes the key agreements by which we have acquired and maintained certain technology related to our ex vivo and in vivo cell engineering platforms and therapeutic programs. 
 Ex Vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 License Agreement with Harvard 
 In March 2019, we entered into a license agreement (as amended, the Harvard Agreement) with the President and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license under certain patent rights controlled by Harvard to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import (i) products and services covered by the patent rights and (ii) products containing stem cells, pluripotent cells or cells derived from stem cells, or pluripotent cells with certain specified genetic modifications ((i) and (ii) together, Harvard Products) or otherwise practice under and exploit the licensed patent rights, for the treatment of disease in humans or, in the case of certain other patent rights, for applications that involve the use of cells derived ex vivo from stem cells in the treatment of disease in humans. We also obtained a non-exclusive, sub-licensable license under certain other patent rights in the United States, and a non-exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide license under know-how pertaining to the licensed patent rights, to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import the Harvard Products, or otherwise practice under and exploit the licensed patent rights and know-how, for the treatment of disease in humans. We have the option to obtain such non-exclusive rights in additional jurisdictions if Harvard is successful in obtaining the right to grant such from the third-party co-owner of such patent rights. In October 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Harvard Agreement to include products containing primary cells with certain specified genetic modifications as Harvard Products. We utilize these license rights in our ex vivo cell engineering program relying on our hypoimmune technology. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop Harvard Products in accordance with a written development plan, to market the Harvard Products following receipt of regulatory approval, and to achieve certain specified development and regulatory milestones within specified time periods, as such period may be extended, for at least two Harvard Products. 
 The licenses granted pursuant to the Harvard Agreement are subject to certain rights retained by Harvard and the rights of the U.S. government. The retained rights of Harvard pertain only to the ability of Harvard and other not-for-profit research organizations to conduct academic research and educational and scholarly activities and do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. We agreed that we will not use any of the licensed patent rights for human germline modification, including intentionally modifying the DNA of human embryos or human reproductive cells. 
 Pursuant to the Harvard Agreement, we paid Harvard an upfront fee of $3.0 million, and we issued 2.2 million shares of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock to Harvard as partial consideration for the licenses granted under the Harvard Agreement. Additionally, we paid $6.0 million to Harvard in connection with the issuance of shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock. We paid Harvard annual license maintenance fees of $25,000 for 2019, $50,000 for 2020, and $100,000 for each of 2021 and 2022, and we are required to pay annual license maintenance fees of $100,000 for each calendar year thereafter for the remainder of the term. We are required to pay Harvard up to an aggregate of $15.2 million per Harvard Product upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development and regulatory milestones for up to a total of five Harvard Products, or an aggregate total of $76.0 million for all five Harvard Products. These milestone payments would double if we undergo a change of control. We are also obligated to pay, 
 61

on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, royalties in the low single-digit percentage range on quarterly net sales of Harvard Products covered by licensed patent rights, and a lower single-digit percentage royalty on quarterly net sales of Harvard Products not covered by licensed patent rights. The royalty rates with respect to Harvard Products covered by licensed patent rights are also subject to specified and capped reductions for loss of market exclusivity and for payments owed to third parties with respect to patent rights which cover Harvard Products in the territory. We are also obligated to pay Harvard a percentage of certain sublicense income ranging from the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. We are obligated to pay up to $175.0 million in success payments based on increases in the per share fair value of our common stock at pre-specified valuation dates that include the one-year anniversary of the consummation of our IPO and periodically thereafter, the date of the consummation of a merger, an asset sale, or merger, or the sale of the majority of the shares held by our Series A convertible preferred stockholders, and the last day of the term of the success payments. 
 The Harvard Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights or, if later, at the end of the final royalty term, which is determined on a Harvard Product-by- Harvard Product and country-by-country basis, and is the later of (i) the date on which the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such Harvard Product in such country expires, (ii) expiry of regulatory exclusivity for such Harvard Product in such country, or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of such Harvard Product in such country, which we expect to occur in 2039. We also have the right to terminate the Harvard Agreement in its entirety for any reason upon 45 days’ prior written notice to Harvard. Either party may terminate the Harvard Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. Harvard may terminate the Harvard Agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceedings. If we terminate the Harvard Agreement for convenience, our obligations to pay milestones and royalties with respect to Harvard Products that are not then covered by licensed patent rights will survive for the remainder for the applicable royalty term. If the Harvard Agreement is terminated for any reason, then sublicensees, other than our affiliates or sublicensees in material default or at fault for the termination, have the right to enter into a direct license with Harvard on substantially the same non-economic terms and on economic terms providing for the payment to Harvard of the consideration that would otherwise have been payable if the Harvard Agreement and the sublicense were not terminated. 
 License Agreement with UCSF 
 In January 2019, we entered into a license agreement (as amended, the UCSF Agreement) with The Regents of the University of California (The Regents) acting through its Office of Technology Management, University of California San Francisco (UCSF), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license to inventions related to immunoengineered pluripotent cells and derivatives claimed in U.S. and international patents and patent applications (UCSF Patent Rights) by The Regents. The license is to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products that are covered by such UCSF Patent Rights, provide licensed services, practice licensed methods, and otherwise practice under the UCSF Patent Rights, for use in humans only, in the United States and other countries where The Regents is not prohibited by applicable law from granting such UCSF Patent Rights. We have the right to sublicense our rights granted under the UCSF Agreement to third parties subject to certain terms and conditions. We utilize these license rights in our ex vivo cell engineering platform program that relies on our hypoimmune technology. 
 We are obligated, directly or through affiliates or sub-licensees, to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, and sell one or more licensed products and licensed services and to bring one or more licensed products or licensed services to market. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary governmental approvals in each country where licensed products or licensed services are manufactured, used, sold, offered for sale, or imported. We are required to spend at least $30.0 million towards research, development, and commercialization of licensed products within five years after the closing of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock financing. In addition, we are required to achieve certain specified development and regulatory milestones within specified time periods. We have the ability to extend the time periods for achievement of development and regulatory milestones under certain terms set forth in the UCSF Agreement, including payment of extension fees. If we are unable to complete any of the specified milestones by the completion date, or extended completion date, for such milestone, then The Regents has the right and option to either terminate the Agreement, subject to our ability to cure the applicable breach, or convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license. 
 The Regents reserves and retains the right to make, use and practice the invention, and any related technology, and to make and use any products and to practice any process that is the subject of the UCSF Patent Rights (and to grant any of the foregoing rights to other educational and non-profit institutions) for educational and non-commercial research purposes, including publications and other communication of research results. This does not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. 
 Pursuant to the UCSF Agreement, we paid an upfront license fee of $100,000 to The Regents, and we issued The Regents 0.7 million shares of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock. In addition, we entered into an amendment to the UCSF Agreement in December 2020, pursuant to which we issued 37,500 shares of our common stock to The Regents. We are required to pay license maintenance fees ranging from $10,000 on the first anniversary of the date of the UCSF Agreement to $40,000 on the sixth anniversary and continuing annually thereafter. This fee shall not be due if we are selling or exploiting licensed products or licensed 
 62

services and paying an earned royalty to The Regents on net sales of such licensed products or licensed service. We are required to pay The Regents up to an aggregate of $2.45 million per licensed product upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development and regulatory milestones for the first five licensed products and half such amount for the second five licensed products, for an aggregate total of $18.4 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. Additionally, we are required to pay The Regents up to an aggregate of $0.5 million per licensed product upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones for the first five licensed products and half such amount for the second five licensed products, for an aggregate total of $3.75 million in commercial milestone payments. With respect to each licensed product, licensed service, or licensed method, we are obligated to pay, on a country-by-country basis, tiered royalties on net sales in the low single-digits. The royalty rates are subject to specified capped reductions for payments owed to unaffiliated third parties in consideration for patent rights, or patent rights together with know-how, in order to practice licensed methods or to make, have made, use sell, offer to sell, or import licensed products or licensed services. We are required to pay to The Regents a minimum annual royalty of $100,000 beginning with the year of the first sale of a licensed product or licensed service and ending upon the expiration of the last-to-expire UCSF Patent Right. This will be credited against any earned royalty due for the twelve-month period following which the minimum payment was made and pro-rated. We are also obligated to pay The Regents a percentage of certain non-royalty sublicense income ranging from the low double-digits to mid-twenties. 
 The UCSF Agreement will expire on expiration or abandonment of the last valid claims within the UCSF Patent Rights licensed thereunder, which we expect to occur in 2040. The Regents has the right to terminate the Agreement if we fail to cure or discontinue a material breach within 60 days of receiving a notice of default. We have the right to terminate the UCSF Agreement in its entirety or under certain UCSF Patent Rights on a country-by-country basis at any time by providing 60 days’ notice of termination to The Regents. The UCSF Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of our bankruptcy that is not dismissed within a specified time period. The Regents may immediately terminate the Agreement upon written notice if we file a non-defensive patent challenge. The termination of the UCSF Agreement will not relieve us of obligations to pay any fees, royalties, or other payments owed to The Regents at the time of such termination or expiration, including the right to receive earned royalties. If the UCSF Agreement is terminated for any reason, then, upon the request of any sublicensee, The Regents will enter into a direct license with such sublicensee on the same terms as the UCSF Agreement, taking into account any difference in license scope, territory, and duration of sublicense grant, provided that such sublicensee is not at the time of such termination in breach of its sublicensing agreement and is not at the time of such termination an opposing party in any legal proceeding against The Regents. 
 2019 Exclusive License Agreement with Washington University 
 In November 2019, we entered into a license agreement (the 2019 WU Agreement) with Washington University, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive sublicensable, non-transferable, worldwide license under certain Washington University patent rights related to genetically engineered hypoimmunogenic stem cells to research, develop, make, have made, and sell products, the manufacture, use, sale or import of which by us or our sublicensees would, in the absence of the 2019 WU Agreement, infringe at least one valid claim of the licensed patent rights (WU Hypoimmune Products). 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop, manufacture, promote and sell WU Hypoimmune Products and (ii) to achieve certain development, regulatory, and commercial diligence milestones within specified time periods. We have the ability to extend the time periods for achievement of such milestones under certain terms set forth in the 2019 WU Agreement, including payment of extension fees. 
 Washington University retains the right to make, have made, use, and import WU Hypoimmune Products in fields relating to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases or disorders for research and educational purposes, including collaboration with other nonprofit entities, but excluding any commercial purposes, and such retained rights do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. Washington University retains all rights not granted to us under the patents. In addition, the 2019 WU Agreement is subject to certain rights retained by the U.S. government, including the requirement that licensed products sold in the U.S. be substantially manufactured in the U.S. 
 Pursuant to the 2019 WU Agreement, we paid Washington University an upfront fee of $75,000. We are required to pay Washington University up to $100,000 in license maintenance fees on each anniversary of the 2019 WU Agreement’s effective date until the first commercial sale of a WU Hypoimmune Product. Upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, we are required to pay Washington University up to an aggregate of $2.0 million in milestone payments per WU Hypoimmune Product for the first three WU Hypoimmune Products, for an aggregate of $6 million in development and regulatory milestones. Additionally, upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones, we are required to pay Washington University up to an aggregate of $2.5 million in milestone payments per WU Hypoimmune Product for the first three WU Hypoimmune Products, for an aggregate of $7.5 million in commercial milestones. We are also obligated to pay royalties on annual net sales in the low single-digits, subject to a minimum amount of royalties payable in advance. The minimum annual royalty for the first anniversary of the effective date following the first commercial sale will be $100,000 and subsequently will increase up to a maximum minimum annual royalty of $750,000 on the fourth anniversary of the effective date following the first commercial sale. The royalties are payable 
 63

provided there is at least one valid claim of licensed patent rights present in the country of manufacture or sale. The royalty rates are also subject to specified and capped reduction upon certain other events. Furthermore, we are obligated to pay Washington University a percentage of certain non-royalty sublicense income in the low double-digits. 
 The 2019 WU Agreement will expire upon the last-to-expire valid claim in the licensed patent rights, which we expect to occur in 2038. We also have the right to terminate the 2019 WU Agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Washington University. Washington University may terminate the 2019 WU Agreement upon our material breach that is not cured within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. In addition, Washington University may terminate the 2019 WU Agreement (i) upon 30 days’ written notice if we fail to achieve certain development, regulatory, or commercial diligence milestones and are unable to resolve Washington University’s concerns through good faith negotiations in accordance with the 2019 WU Agreement, (ii) upon our bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iii) if an order is made or a notice is issued convening a meeting of our stockholders to consider the passing of a resolution of our winding up or a resolution is passed for our winding up (in each case, other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction). If the 2019 WU Agreement terminates prior to the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights, we agree (i) to promptly discontinue the exportation of licensed products, (ii) to promptly discontinue the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the licensed products, (iii) to promptly destroy all licensed products in inventory, and (iv) not to manufacture, sell, or distribute licensed products until the expiration of the applicable last-to-expire licensed patent rights. 
 2020 License Agreement with Washington University 
 In September 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the 2020 WU Agreement) with Washington University for certain patent rights relating to the methods and compositions of generating cells of endodermal lineage and beta cells and uses thereof. Under the 2020 WU Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, and royalty-bearing license under the patent rights to research, develop, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, have sold, use, have used, export, and import licensed products, the manufacture, use, sale or import of which by us or our sublicensees would, in the absence of the 2020 WU Agreement, infringe at least one valid claim of the licensed patent rights, solely in fields relating to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human diseases or disorders. We utilize these license rights in our ex vivo cell engineering platform program that relies on our hypoimmune technology, including our beta cell program. 
 Under the 2020 WU Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) develop, manufacture, promote, and sell licensed products, and (ii)  achieve certain development, regulatory, and commercial diligence milestones within specified time periods. We have the ability to extend the time periods for achievement of such milestones under certain terms set forth in the 2020 WU Agreement, including payment of extension fees. 
 Washington University retains the right to use the licensed patent rights to make, have made, use, and import licensed products worldwide in fields relating to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human disease or disorders for research and educational purposes, including collaboration with other nonprofit entities, but expressly excluding any commercial purposes, and such retained rights do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. In addition, the 2020 WU Agreement is subject to certain rights retained by the U.S. government, including the requirement that licensed products sold in the U.S. be substantially manufactured in the U.S. 
 Pursuant to the 2020 WU Agreement, we paid Washington University an upfront license issue fee of $150,000. We are required to pay annual license maintenance fees on each anniversary of the 2020 WU Agreement’s effective date until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. The license maintenance fee for the first and second anniversaries of the effective date will be $25,000 and subsequently will increase by $25,000 per two anniversaries up to a maximum annual license maintenance fee of $100,000. We are also required to pay Washington University up to an aggregate of $2.0 million upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development and regulatory milestones per licensed product for the first three licensed products under the 2020 WU Agreement, for an aggregate of $6 million in development and regulatory milestones. Additionally, we are required to pay Washington University, up to an aggregate of $4.5 million upon the achievement of certain pre-specified commercial milestones per licensed product for the first three licensed products under the 2020 WU Agreement, for an aggregate of $13.5 million in commercial milestones. We are also required to pay, for each licensed product made or sold by or for us worldwide, earned royalties on net sales of the licensed products in the low single-digits, with the royalty rate being subject to specified and capped reduction upon certain events. Under the 2020 WU Agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum annual royalty commencing with the first anniversary of the effective date following the first commercial sale of the licensed product, which will be paid as an advance against the earned royalties paid to Washington University over the ensuing 12-month period. The minimum annual royalty for the first anniversary of the effective date following the first commercial sale will be $100,000 and subsequently will increase up to a maximum minimum annual royalty of $750,000 on the fourth anniversary of the effective date following the first commercial sale. The royalties are payable provided there is at least one valid claim of the licensed patent rights present in the country of manufacture or sale. Furthermore, we are obligated to pay Washington University a percentage of certain non-royalty sublicense income in the low double-digits. 
 64

The 2020 WU Agreement will expire upon the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed patent rights, which we expect to occur in 2038. We also have the right to terminate the 2020 WU Agreement for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Washington University. Washington University may terminate the 2020 WU Agreement upon our material breach that is not cured within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. In addition, Washington University may terminate the 2020 WU Agreement (i) upon 30 days’ written notice if we fail to achieve certain development, regulatory, or commercial diligence milestones and are unable to resolve Washington University’s concerns through good faith negotiations in accordance with the 2020 WU Agreement, (ii) upon our bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iii) if an order is made or a notice is issued convening a meeting of our stockholders to consider the passing of a resolution of our winding up or a resolution is passed for our winding up (in each case, other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction). If the 2020 WU Agreement terminates prior to the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent rights, we agree (i) to promptly discontinue the exportation of licensed products, (ii) to promptly discontinue the manufacture, sale and distribution of the licensed products, (iii) to promptly destroy all licensed products in inventory, and (iv) not to manufacture, sell, or distribute licensed products until the expiration of the applicable last-to-expire licensed patent rights. 
 Oscine Acquisition 
 In September 2020, we acquired Oscine Corp. (Oscine), a privately-held early-stage biotechnology company pursing a glial progenitor ex vivo cell engineering program, in exchange for $8.5 million in cash, net of certain expenses. Of the total purchase price, $7.6 million was an upfront cash payment and $0.9 million was set aside (the Oscine Holdback Amount) to satisfy certain general representations and warranties as set forth in the stock purchase agreement. We had originally entered into a collaboration, license and option to purchase agreement with Oscine in November 2018. That agreement was terminated upon the closing of our acquisition of Oscine. As part of the Oscine acquisition, we also agreed to pay additional amounts of up to an aggregate of $225.8 million upon achievement of certain pre-specified development and commercial milestones, which we may pay in cash or in shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions. As a result of the Oscine acquisition, we entered into, or obtained and amended, licenses to various technologies related to our glial progenitor ex vivo cell-based therapy program, including a license agreement with University of Rochester and a seed bank supply agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. 
 License Agreement with University of Rochester 
 Effective as of the closing of the Oscine acquisition, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement (the Rochester Agreement) with the University of Rochester, which amended and restated a prior license agreement between Oscine and its affiliates and the University of Rochester and assigned Oscine’s rights and obligations in the license agreement to us. Under the Rochester Agreement, we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patents, and a non-exclusive, royalty-free license under know-how, to research, develop, import, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, commercialize, and otherwise exploit cell-based therapies for the treatment of human central nervous system disease and disorders. We utilize these license rights in our glial progenitor cell-based therapy program. We granted the University of Rochester a license to practice any patent rights that cover inventions in the field of cell-based therapies for human central nervous system diseases and disorders, which inventions are first conceived and reduced to practice solely by Dr. Steven Goldman acting in his capacity as our employee, or jointly with any of our employees reporting to Dr. Goldman, solely for Dr. Goldman or any of his lab members at the University of Rochester to practice such patent rights within Dr. Goldman’s laboratory at the University of Rochester for internal academic research purposes. University of Rochester granted us an automatic royalty-free non-exclusive license, and the option to obtain exclusive rights, to any patent rights or inventions conceived or reduced to practice by Dr. Goldman or members of his laboratory at the University of Rochester within a certain timeframe in connection with the internal academic research license that we granted to the University of Rochester. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to proceed with the commercial exploitation of the patents, to create a reasonable supply of licensed products to meet demand, and to adhere to a specified commercial development plan for development of stem cell therapy products, with pre-specified development milestones, including obtaining government approvals to market at least one licensed product, and to market such product within twelve months of receiving such approval.
 The licenses granted pursuant to the Rochester Agreement are subject to certain rights retained by the University of Rochester and the rights of the U.S. government. The retained rights of the University of Rochester pertain only to its ability to conduct internal academic research other than clinical research and for teaching, education, and other non-commercial research activities, in publications related to its scientific research and findings, and for any other non-clinical and non-commercial purpose that is not inconsistent with the rights granted to us under the Rochester Agreement. These retained rights do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. 
 Pursuant to the Rochester Agreement, we are obligated to pay to University of Rochester minimum annual royalties beginning in January 2023, the amount of which payments will be $20,000 in 2023, $50,000 in 2025, and will increase to $70,000 in 2028 and beyond. The minimum annual royalty payment is creditable against our obligation to pay tiered royalties on annual net sales in the low single-digits. The royalty rates are also subject to reduction upon certain other events. We are also required to pay University of Rochester up to an aggregate of $950,000 upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development and commercial milestones for 
 65

each licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay a tiered mid-single digit to mid-double digit percentage of revenue arising from any sublicenses granted by us to third parties. 
 The Rochester Agreement will terminate on the last-to-expire of the licensed patents thereunder, which we expect to occur in 2038. We also have the right to terminate the Rochester Agreement in its entirety for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the University of Rochester. The University of Rochester may terminate the Rochester Agreement upon our material breach that is not cured within 30 days of receiving written notice thereof or immediately in the event of our bankruptcy. The University of Rochester may also terminate the Rochester Agreement, or at its sole discretion terminate the exclusivity of the license granted, upon our failure to meet the diligence obligations under and cure such failure within 90 days of our receipt of notice thereof, or such longer reasonable time determined by University of Rochester, at its discretion, and subject to a good faith negotiation mechanism included in the Rochester Agreement. 
 Supply Agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. 
 In July 2018, Oscine Therapeutics (U.S.) Inc., an affiliate of Oscine, entered into a supply agreement (as amended, the Hadasit Agreement) with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (Hadasit), pursuant to which Oscine obtained a quantity of seed bank cells and accompanying regulatory information on a non-exclusive basis for the sole purpose of developing, manufacturing, and selling cell therapy products for the treatment or prevention of central nervous system disorders in humans, which cell therapy products are derived using the Oscine proprietary differentiation technology from a certain human ESC line provided by Hadasit under the Hadasit Agreement. We utilize these cells and information in our glial progenitor cell program. Concurrently with our acquisition of Oscine in September 2020, the Hadasit Agreement was assigned by Oscine Therapeutics (U.S.) Inc. to Oscine. We amended the Hadasit Agreement effective as of the closing of the Oscine acquisition, and we subsequently assigned the Hadasit Agreement from Oscine to us. 
 Pursuant to the Hadasit Agreement, Oscine Therapeutics (U.S.) Inc. paid Hadasit an upfront fee of $24,000. We are required to pay Hadasit up to an aggregate of $1.1 million upon the achievement of certain development milestones for the first product. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of the relevant products worldwide, which obligation shall commence upon the first commercial sale of a relevant product and shall expire after 15 years on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. The royalty rates are also subject to reduction upon certain other events. 
 The Hadasit Agreement will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. Hadasit may terminate the Hadasit Agreement upon giving 30 days’ written notice if we fail to make any payment due thereunder and do not cure such failure within 30 days’ notice, or upon 60 days’ written notice if we cease to use the seed bank cells for the development and manufacture of our products, subject to our ability to dispute Hadasit’s claim and resolution of such dispute in accordance with a process set forth in the Hadasit Agreement. Either party may terminate the Hadasit Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof, or upon giving written notice thereof, in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. 
 Cytocardia Acquisition 
 In November 2019, we acquired Cytocardia, Inc. (Cytocardia), a privately-held early-stage biotechnology company developing ex vivo cell engineering programs focused on the replacement of damaged heart cells, in exchange for $8.0 million in cash, net of certain indebtedness and expenses, of which $6.8 million was an upfront cash payment, and $1.2 million was set aside (Cytocardia Holdback Amount) to satisfy certain general representations and warranties set forth in the stock purchase agreement. We also agreed to pay additional amounts of up to an aggregate of $75.0 million upon our achievement of certain pre-specified development milestones and up to an aggregate of $65.0 million in pre-specified commercial milestones. As a result of that transaction, we obtained licenses to various intellectual property and technologies, including intellectual property and technology related to our cardiomyocyte program that we rely on for development of our cardiac cell therapy product candidates. These included a license agreement with the University of Washington, as described below. 
University of Washington 
 In October 2018, Cytocardia entered into an exclusive start-up license agreement (as amended, the UW Agreement) with the University of Washington (UW), pursuant to which Cytocardia obtained an exclusive license under certain patents relating to stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and heart regeneration owned solely by UW or jointly by UW and the University of Cambridge, for which UW has the sole right to control the protection and licensing pursuant an inter-institutional agreement between UW and the University of Cambridge. We amended the UW Agreement in November 2019, concurrently with the closing of our acquisition of Cytocardia, and in July 2020 assigned the UW Agreement from Cytocardia to us. We further amended the UW Agreement in January 2021, February 2021, March 2021, April 2021, July 2021, September 2021, and October 2021 to add additional patent families to the scope of the license. The scope of the license is to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, offer to lease or lease, import, or otherwise 
 66

offer to dispose of products worldwide (i) for any use, with respect to certain specified licensed patents, (ii) for the production of cardiomyocytes having an atrial or ventricular phenotype, with respect to other specified licensed patents, and (iii) heart regeneration therapy, with respect to other specified licensed patents. Additionally, UW granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain related know-how, clinical trial information, and program materials. We may sublicense the exclusively licensed rights under the UW Agreement. We may also sublicense the non-exclusively licensed rights, but only for the purpose of using them in conjunction with exclusively licensed rights. We utilize intellectual property in our cardiomyocyte program. For a period of 12 months after the effective date of the UW Agreement, UW agreed to provide reasonable written notice to us of any improvements to the licensed patents upon notice to UW. 
 We have the option to add such improvements to the licensed patents. Pursuant to the UW Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed rights and to make and sell licensed products as soon as practicable and to maximize sales thereof. We are also obligated to achieve specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones within specified time periods. 
 Inventions covered in the licensed patents have arisen, in whole or in part, from federally supported research by the U.S. federal government, and the licenses granted pursuant to the UW Agreement are subject to certain rights of the U.S. government. UW has retained for itself as well as for Cambridge University and for any other not-for-profit academic research institution, an irrevocable, nonexclusive right to practice the licensed rights for academic research and instructional or any other academic or non-commercial purpose. UW has retained for itself an irrevocable, nonexclusive license to practice licensed rights for clinical purposes. Cambridge University has also retained for itself an irrevocable, nonexclusive license to practice certain rights co-owned with UW for clinical purposes. 
 Pursuant to the UW Agreement, we will pay to UW a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products, with the royalty rate being subject to specified and capped reduction upon certain events. We will pay minimum annual fees for the term of the UW Agreement, to be creditable against running royalty payments for the preceding calendar year on a noncumulative basis. These minimum annual fees are due following the second anniversary of the effective date of the UW Agreement and continue during the term of the UW Agreement, ranging from $5,000 up to $50,000 for the years following the second anniversary of the first commercial sale of an FDA-approved licensed product. We will also pay to UW non-cumulative, non-creditable, and non-refundable development milestone payments of up to $175,000 and commercial milestone payments of up to $700,000 for the first licensed product to achieve each applicable milestone event. Furthermore, pursuant to the UW Agreement, we are obligated to pay UW a percentage of certain non-royalty sublicense income ranging from the low single-digits to middle double-digits, depending on the stage of development of our licensed products at the time of execution of the sublicense agreement. 
 The UW Agreement will expire, without further action by the parties, when all valid claims of the licensed patents have expired, and we have sold all licensed products manufactured prior to the expiration of such valid claims, which we expect to occur in 2040. UW may terminate the UW Agreement if we (i) permanently cease operations, (ii) voluntarily file or have filed against us a petition under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws that we fail to have released within 30 days after filing, (iii) propose any dissolution, composition, or financial reorganization with creditors, or if a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent is appointed, (iv) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (v)  challenge the validity of the licensed patents, or (vi)  breach our material obligations under the UW Agreement and do not cure such breach within 60 days. We may terminate the UW Agreement at any time by delivering to UW a written notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the effective date of termination. In addition, we may propose to terminate certain of our licensed rights under the UW Agreement by delivering to UW a written notice of termination accompanied by a proposed written amendment to the UW Agreement at least 60 days prior to the effective date of termination of such licensed rights. 
 Non-Exclusive License and Development Agreement with FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics, Inc. 
 In February 2021, we entered into a non-exclusive license and development agreement (as amended, the FCDI Agreement) with FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics, Inc. (FCDI), pursuant to which we obtained non-exclusive rights and a license under certain intellectual property rights controlled by FCDI (including intellectual property rights owned by FCDI and patent rights in-licensed from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation) to research, develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit human cell therapy products derived from certain iPSC lines for the treatment or prevention of certain diseases. We anticipate utilizing these intellectual property rights and iPSC lines in certain of our ex vivo cell engineering programs. 
 Pursuant to the FCDI Agreement, we agreed to pay FCDI an upfront fee of $1.0 million, annual license maintenance fees, and license fees of up to $500,000 per indication for one certain cell type or up to $350,000 per indication for certain other cell types. We are required to pay FCDI up to an aggregate of $28.5 million per indication upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development and regulatory milestones for up to a total of three indications and up to an aggregate of $14.25 million in pre-specified development and regulatory milestones for each additional indication. We are also required to pay up to an aggregate of $8.8 million per product upon the achievement of certain pre-specified commercial milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties on 
 67

annual net sales of the relevant products worldwide in the low- to mid-single digits, which obligation shall commence upon the first commercial sale of a relevant product and shall expire after 15 years on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. The royalty rates are also subject to reduction upon certain other events. 
 The FCDI Agreement will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. FCDI may terminate the FCDI Agreement upon giving written notice if we fail to make any payment due or upon our material breach, subject, in each case, to our ability to dispute or cure such breach. We may also terminate the FCDI Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice, and either party may terminate upon giving written notice in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. 
 
License Agreement with Beam
 
In October 2021, we entered into an option and license agreement (the Beam Agreement) with Beam, pursuant to which Beam granted us a non-exclusive license to use Beam’s proprietary CRISPR Cas12b nuclease editing technology for a specified number of gene editing targets to research, develop and commercialize engineered cell therapy products that (i) are directed to certain antigen targets, with respect to our allogeneic T cell programs, or (ii) comprise certain human cell types, with respect to our stem cell-derived programs. We are permitted to use the CRISPR Cas12b system to modify or introduce, ex vivo, selected genetic sequences with respect to licensed products.  The Beam Agreement excludes any rights to base editing using the CRISPR Cas12b system.
 Pursuant to the Beam Agreement, we have the option, for a period of one year from the effective date of the Beam Agreement, to select additional antigen targets, with respect to our allogeneic T cell programs, or human cell types, with respect to our stem cell-derived programs, in each case, upon our payment of an option payment of $10 million per antigen target or cell type. In addition, we may, for a period of three years from the effective date of the Beam Agreement, (i) elect to replace an antigen target, with respect to our allogeneic T cell programs, or human cell type, with respect to our stem cell-derived programs (Replacement Right) previously selected by us, and (ii) select new gene editing targets, or replace gene editing targets previously selected by us, with respect to any licensed product (Gene Nomination Right). In each case, our rights with respect to its exercise of the option, Replacement Right or Gene Nomination Right are subject to certain limitations. 
 Pursuant to the Beam Agreement, we paid Beam an upfront payment of $50 million. Additionally, with respect to each licensed product, we will be obligated to pay to Beam up to $65 million in specified developmental and commercial milestone payments. We will also be obligated to pay to Beam an aggregate royalty, including any royalty owed by Beam to its licensor, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, in the low- to mid-single digits, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, on net sales of each licensed product until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering such licensed product in the applicable country, (ii) the date on which any applicable regulatory exclusivity, including orphan drug, new chemical entity, data or pediatric exclusivity, with respect to such licensed product expires in such country, or (iii) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. 
 Unless earlier terminated by either party, the Beam Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of our payment obligations with respect to each licensed product thereunder. We may terminate the Beam Agreement in its entirety or on an antigen target-by-antigen target basis (with respect to licensed product applicable to our allogeneic T cell programs), on a cell type-by-cell type basis (with respect to licensed product applicable to our stem cell-derived programs), or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, in each case, upon (i) 90 days’ advance written notice, if such notice is provided prior to the first commercial sale of a licensed product, or (ii) 180 days’ advance written notice, if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of a licensed product. Either party may terminate the Beam Agreement with written notice for the other party’s material breach if such breaching party fails to timely cure the breach with respect to the country in which such material breach relates. Beam may terminate the Beam Agreement in its entirety if we or our affiliates or sublicensees commence a legal action challenging the validity, patentability, enforceability, or scope of any of the patent rights licensed to us thereunder. Either party also may terminate the Beam Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
 
License Agreement with the NIH
 
In January 2022, we entered into a patent license agreement (the NIH Agreement) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by The National Cancer Institute, an institute of the National Institutes of Health (the NIH), pursuant to which the NIH granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, commercial license under certain patent rights related to certain fully-human anti-CD22 binders and CD22 CAR constructs comprising such binders for use in certain in vivo gene therapy and ex vivo allogeneic CAR T cell applications for B cell malignancies. The license grant is subject to customary statutory requirements and reserved rights as required under federal law and NIH requirements. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the licensed patent rights with the NIH’s prior consent.
 Pursuant to the NIH Agreement, we paid to the NIH an upfront payment of $1.0 million. Additionally, we will be obligated to pay to the NIH (i) up to an aggregate of $9.6 million in specified regulatory, developmental, and commercial milestone payments 
 68

with respect to each product developed through exploitation of the licensed patent rights, and (ii) a payment of $1,000,000 upon the assignment of the NIH Agreement to an affiliate upon a change of control. In addition, we are obligated to pay to the NIH (i) a royalty on net sales of licensed products in the low-single digits, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, and subject to certain annual minimum royalty payments, and (ii) a percentage, ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens, of revenues from sublicensing arrangements. Additionally, if we are granted a priority review voucher by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with respect to a licensed product, we will be obligated to pay to the NIH the greater of (i) $5,000,000 or (ii) a percentage in the mid-single digits of any consideration received for the sale, transfer, or lease of such priority review voucher. We are also obligated to pay to the NIH a percentage in the low-single digits of the consideration we receive for any assignment of the NIH Agreement to a non-affiliate.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to exploit, and make publicly available, inventions developed by the exploitation of the licensed patent rights, including licensed products.
 
Unless earlier terminated by either party, the NIH Agreement will terminate upon expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in the licensed patent rights. The NIH may terminate the Agreement with written notice for our material breach if we fail to timely cure such breach or upon certain insolvency events involving us. In addition, the NIH may terminate or modify the NIH Agreement, at its option, if the NIH determines that such termination or modification is necessary to meet the requirements for public use specified by federal regulations issued after the effective date of the NIH Agreement, and we do not reasonably and timely satisfy these requirements. We may terminate the NIH Agreement or any licenses in any country or territory upon 60 days’ prior written notice.
 
In Vivo Cell Engineering Platform 
 Cobalt Acquisition 
 In February 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Cobalt Biomedicine, Inc. (Cobalt), a privately-held early-stage biotechnology company founded by a Flagship Labs innovation team within Flagship Pioneering led by Dr. Geoffrey von Maltzahn that was developing a fusogen technology platform to specifically and consistently deliver diverse payloads—including DNA, RNA, and proteins—to targeted cells in vivo, in consideration of the issuance of 36.4 million shares of our Series A-2 convertible preferred stock, valued at $136.0 million. Of the 36.4 million shares of Series A-2 convertible preferred stock issued, 12.1 million shares were contingent on the achievement of a pre-specified development milestone, which was achieved in July 2019. We also agreed to pay contingent consideration of up to an aggregate of $500.0 million upon our achievement of certain pre-specified development milestones and a success payment of up to $500.0 million (the Cobalt Success Payment), which we may elect to pay in cash or in stock. The payout of the Cobalt Success Payment will only be paid if, at pre-determined valuation measurement dates, our market capitalization equals or exceeds $8.1 billion, and we are advancing a program based on the fusogen technology in a clinical trial pursuant to an IND, or have filed for, or received approval for, a BLA or NDA with respect to a program based on the fusogen technology. The valuation measurement dates for the Cobalt Success Payments are triggered by certain pre-determined valuation measurement dates, including the closing of our IPO and periodically thereafter. In addition to our IPO, a valuation measurement date would be triggered upon a change of control if at least one of our programs based on the fusogen technology is the subject of an active research program at the time of such change of control. As a result of the Cobalt transaction, we obtained licenses to various technologies and intellectual property rights that relate to the development of our fusogen technology and related fusosome programs, including exclusive license agreements with Flagship Pioneering Innovations V, Inc. (Flagship) and La Societe Pulsalys (Pulsalys), as well as several exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements, including one such option with The Regents of the University of California acting through The Technology Development Group of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with whom we later entered into an exclusive license agreement. 
License Agreement with Flagship 
 In February 2016, Cobalt entered into an agreement (as amended, the Flagship Agreement), with Flagship, pursuant to which (i) Cobalt irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to Flagship all of its right, title and interest in and to certain foundational intellectual property developed by Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship Management) during the exploration and/or proto-company phase of Cobalt prior to its spin-out from Flagship (the Managerial Agreement), as set forth in the Flagship Agreement (such foundational intellectual property, the Fusogen Foundational IP), and (ii) Cobalt obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, transferable license from Flagship under such Fusogen Foundational IP to develop, manufacture, and commercialize any product or process or component thereof, the development, manufacturing and commercialization of which would infringe at least one valid claim of Fusogen Foundational IP absent the license granted under the Flagship Agreement (Fusogen Products) in the field of human therapeutics during the term of the Flagship Agreement. In addition, Flagship irrevocably and unconditionally assigned to Cobalt all of its right, title and interest in and to any and all patents claiming any inventions conceived (i) solely by Flagship Management or jointly by Flagship Management and Cobalt, (ii) after Cobalt’s spinout from Flagship, and (iii) as a result of activities conducted pursuant the Managerial Agreement or other participation of Flagship Management in Cobalt’s affairs, but excluding Fusogen Foundational IP. We utilize the rights granted by Flagship under the Flagship Agreement in our fusogen platform and related 
 69

therapeutic product candidates. The license granted to Fusogen Foundational IP is contingent upon Cobalt’s compliance with its obligations under the Flagship Agreement. Under the Flagship Agreement, Cobalt also granted Flagship a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable license to practice the Fusogen Foundational IP within the field of human therapeutics solely to perform under the Managerial Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Flagship Agreement, Cobalt is obligated to pay, on a Fusogen Product-by-Fusogen Product and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, royalties in the low single-digit percentage on net sales of Fusogen Products. The Flagship Agreement will terminate on the last-to-expire royalty term, which is determined on a Fusogen Product-by-Fusogen Product and jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and is the earlier of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of any Fusogen Foundational IP covering such Fusogen Product or (ii) the date on which the last applicable additional milestone payment has been made in accordance with that certain merger agreement under which we acquired Cobalt, which we expect to be in 2039. Upon expiration of the royalty term with respect to a Fusogen Product in any jurisdiction and payment in full of all amounts owed under the Flagship Agreement for such Fusogen Product, the license granted to us will automatically convert into a non-exclusive, fully paid-up license for such Fusogen Product in such jurisdiction. We have the right to terminate the Flagship Agreement in its entirety for convenience upon 60 days of written notice. Either party may terminate the Flagship Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 30 days after receiving written notice. Also, Flagship may terminate the Flagship Agreement (i) upon 30 days’ written notice if we cease to carry on our business with respect to the rights granted in the Flagship Agreement, (ii) upon written notice if we experience an event of bankruptcy, or (iii) immediately upon written notice if we challenge the validity, patentability, or enforceability of any Fusogen Foundational IP or participate in any such challenge. 
 Sublicense Agreement with Pulsalys 
 In August 2018, Cobalt entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement (as amended, the Pulsalys Agreement), with Pulsalys, which Cobalt assigned to us in May 2020, and pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable sublicense from Pulsalys of the exclusive license granted to Pulsalys by École normale supérieure de Lyon (ENS Lyon) on behalf of itself and Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (Inserm), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (collectively, the Co-Owners) under certain patent rights relating to methods to selectively modulate the activity of distinct subtypes of immune cells using engineered virus-like particles. In addition, Pulsalys granted us the first right to negotiate an exclusive license to patent rights covering certain improvements to the licensed patent rights that are owned or held by Pulsalys. We utilize the rights granted under the Pulsalys Agreement in our in vivo fusogenic platform and related fusosome programs. Under the Pulsalys Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, which efforts we can demonstrate by the achievement of the following diligence milestones: (i) incurring a minimum annual spend of $1.0 million for each of the five years after the effective date of the Pulsalys Agreement, and (ii) submitting an IND within five years of the effective date of the Pulsalys Agreement. Under the Pulsalys Agreement, the Co-Owners will retain the right to practice the licensed patent rights for non-commercial research purposes, alone or in collaboration with third parties. 
 Pursuant to the Pulsalys Agreement, Cobalt paid Pulsalys an upfront fee of 18,000 EUR. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of 18,000 EUR until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are also required to pay Pulsalys up to an aggregate of 575,000 EUR upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for each of the first three distinct licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to pay an annual royalty in the low single-digits on net sales of the licensed products, with the royalty rate being subject to reduction upon certain events. Lastly, we are obligated to pay percentage annual fees on certain sublicense income in the low single-digits . 
 The Pulsalys Agreement will terminate on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering the making, using, sale, and import of such licensed product in such country or any patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate thereof covering the sale of such licensed product in such country, which we expect to occur in 2037. We also have the right to terminate the Pulsalys Agreement in its entirety upon notice if we determine, in our sole discretion, that continued pursuit of development of the licensed patent rights is not feasible or desirable in the context of (i) the resources available to us or due to external factors such as competition, market forces, or access or license to other reasonably useful intellectual property, or (ii) a change of direction of our business focus. Either party may terminate the Pulsalys Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written notice thereof. Pulsalys may terminate the Pulsalys Agreement (i) in full in the case of we undergo a cessation of business, dissolution or voluntary liquidation, or (ii) in full or in part (x) if we challenge the validity of the licensed patents, provided that such termination will be with respect to the claims within the licensed patents that are the subject of such challenge, or (y)  if we fail to achieve the diligence milestones, and if the parties have not extended such milestones after good faith negotiations, and subject to our ability to cure such failure within 90 days after notice of the same.

License Agreement with UCLA 
 In March 2019, we entered into a license agreement (as amended, the UCLA Agreement) with UCLA, upon the exercise of an option originally granted by UCLA to Cobalt in April 2018. Under the UCLA Agreement, UCLA granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, transferable (subject to certain conditions) license in the licensed territory in the field of human therapeutics under certain patent rights relating to certain virus envelope pseudotyped lentiviruses and methods of their use to (i) research, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold and import licensed products and (ii) practice licensed methods for the purposes of researching, manufacturing, and using licensed products, but not to perform services for a fee. The licensed territory under the UCLA Agreement is all countries of the world in which the licensed patent rights have or will be filed. UCLA agreed not to grant any rights under the licensed patents regarding licensed methods to third parties without first offering us an opportunity to remove the restrictions regarding the use of licensed methods to perform services for a fee. In addition, we agreed not to commercialize any licensed product that is not administered directly to a patient for therapeutic purposes without first negotiating with UCLA for possible development milestones, royalties, or other payments applicable to such licensed products. We utilize the rights granted under the UCLA Agreement in our in vivo fusogenic platform and related fusosome programs. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to (i) develop licensed products, (ii) market licensed products, and (ii) manufacture and sell licensed products in quantities sufficient to meet market demands. We are also required to satisfy certain development and commercial milestones with respect to at least one licensed product that is administered directly to a patient for therapeutic purposes. 
 The license granted pursuant to the UCLA Agreement is subject to certain rights retained by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and the U.S. government, including a non-exclusive, royalty-free license granted to the U.S. government in accordance with 35 U.S.C. §200-212. If CIRM exercises its rights under Title 17, California Code of Regulations, Section 100600, and the scope of our exclusive license under the UCLA Agreement is impacted, then our financial obligations therein will be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, rights retained by CIRM do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. In addition, UCLA retains the right to (i) use the licensed patent rights for educational and research purposes and research sponsored by commercial entities, (ii) publicly disclose research results, (iii) use the licensed patent rights to offer and perform clinical diagnostic and prognostic care solely within the University of California system, and (iv) allow other non-profit and academic institutions to use the licensed patent rights for educational and research purposes and research sponsored by commercial entities, as well as to publicly disclose research results. 
 Pursuant to the UCLA Agreement, we paid UCLA an upfront license issue fee of $25,000. We also reimbursed UCLA for its past patent costs, and we have a continuing obligation to reimburse UCLA for its patent costs during the term of the UCLA Agreement. For licensed products that are administered directly to a patient for therapeutic purposes, we are required to pay UCLA up to an aggregate of (i) $825,000 upon the achievement of certain pre-specified development milestones for each of the first three such licensed products, and (ii) $15.0 million upon the achievement of certain pre-specified commercial milestones for such licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee beginning on the first anniversary of the UCLA Agreement until the first commercial sale of a licensed product. The license maintenance fee for the first anniversary was $10,000, and it will subsequently increase by $10,000 per anniversary up to a maximum annual license maintenance fee of $100,000. We are also required to pay, on a country-by-country basis, earned royalty percentages in the low single-digits on net sales of the licensed products, with the royalty rate being subject to reduction upon certain events. Under the UCLA Agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum annual royalty of $100,000 beginning with the first full calendar year after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, and the minimum annual royalty will be credited against the earned royalty made during the same calendar year. If any claim within the licensed patent rights is held invalid or unenforceable in a final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, all royalty obligations with respect to that claim or any claim patentably indistinct from it will expire as of the date of that final decision. No royalties will be collected or paid on licensed products sold to the U.S. government to the extent required by law, and we will be required to reduce the amount charged for licensed products distributed to the U.S. government by the amount of the royalty that otherwise would have been paid. Furthermore, we are obligated to pay UCLA tiered fees on a percentage of certain sublicense income in the low single-digit to low double-digit range. Lastly, if we challenge the validity of any licensed patent rights, we agree to pay UCLA all royalties and other amounts due in view of our activities under the UCLA Agreement during the period of challenge. If we fail such challenge, we are required to pay two times the royalty rate paid during the period of such challenge for the remaining term of the UCLA Agreement and all of UCLA’s verifiable legal out-of-pocket fees and costs incurred in defending such challenge, including attorney’s fees. 
 The UCLA Agreement will terminate on the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application in the licensed patent rights, which we expect to occur in 2033. We also have the right to terminate the UCLA Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any portion of the licensed patent rights for any reason upon 90 days’ prior written notice to UCLA. UCLA may terminate the UCLA Agreement upon a material breach by us that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written notice. If the breach is incapable of being cured within such period, then UCLA will consider our efforts to avoid, and to take reasonable steps to cure, such breach when determining whether to terminate the UCLA Agreement. Also, UCLA has the right and option, at its sole discretion, to either terminate the UCLA Agreement or reduce our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license if we fail to (i) exercise commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to develop, market, manufacture, and sell licensed products, or 
 71

(ii) achieve certain development milestones set forth in the UCLA Agreement, subject to our ability to extend such milestones in accordance with terms set forth in the UCLA Agreement. Upon our termination of the UCLA Agreement, we may continue to sell any previously manufactured licensed products for 180 days after the effective date of termination. Upon termination of the UCLA Agreement by UCLA for our failure to reimburse UCLA for certain patent costs after the applicable cure period, we may continue to sell all previously made licensed products for 180 days after the effective date of the notice of termination; however, this right is not available if the UCLA Agreement is terminated for any other cause. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
 In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements (GLPs);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board (IRB), or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
 72

In addition to the IND submission process, under the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
 73

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a product candidate that is also a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the application if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the 
 74

BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers. 
 Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT), designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug or biologic that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug or biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug or biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Product candidates granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical trial sites, including through expansion of trials to additional sites. 
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not 
 75

approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements up. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA 
 76

does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and physician and other health care provider transparency laws and regulations. If our significant operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
 77

Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA: 

• | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, on March 2, 2020 the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and to determine the constitutionality of the ACA in its entirety. It is uncertain when the Supreme Court will rule on this case. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the President designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Employees and Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 383 employees, 302 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. A total of 236 employees have an advanced degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may, however, in the ordinary course of business face various claims brought by third parties, and we may, from time to time, make claims or take legal actions to assert our rights, including intellectual property rights as well as claims relating to employment matters and the safety or efficacy of our products. Any of these claims could subject us to costly litigation, and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage, may be inadequately capitalized to pay on valid claims, or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business.
