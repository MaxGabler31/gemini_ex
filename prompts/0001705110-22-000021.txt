OVERVIEW
Who We Are
Angi Inc., formerly ANGI Homeservices Inc., (“Angi,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) connects quality home service professionals with consumers across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling homes to cleaning and landscaping. During the year ended December 31, 2021, over 240,000 domestic service professionals actively sought consumer leads, completed jobs or advertised work through Angi Inc. platforms. Additionally, consumers turned to at least one of our brands to find a service professional for approximately 33 million projects during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
The Company has two operating segments: (i) North America (United States and Canada), which includes Angi Ads, Angi Leads and Angi Services; and (ii) Europe. In March 2021, the Company rebranded its North American brands which operate as follows: Angi Ads operates under the Angi (formerly Angie’s List) brand, Angi Leads operates primarily under the HomeAdvisor, powered by Angi brand, and Angi Services operates primarily under the Handy and Angi Roofing brands. The Company categorizes its services under two main areas: 1) Angi Leads and Angi Ads, which include services that generate revenue from service professionals for consumer matches, revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising, and membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers; and 2) Angi Services, which primarily includes its pre-priced offerings by which the consumer purchases services directly from the Company and the Company engages a service professional to perform the service, as well as revenue from services provided by Angi Roofing, LLC (which includes the business the Company acquired on July 1, 2021 known as Total Home Roofing, Inc.)
We have been incorporated in the State of Delaware since 2017 and operate under the name Angi Inc., formerly ANGI Homeservices Inc. We are a publicly traded holding company that was formed to facilitate the combination of IAC/InterActiveCorp’s (“IAC”) HomeAdvisor business and Angie’s List, Inc. (the “Combination”), which was completed on September 29, 2017. 
As used herein, “Angi,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Angi Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESSES
Angi Ads, Leads, & Angi Services
In the United States, the Company offers its service professionals and consumers three main services: 1) our Angi Ads business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory; 2) our Angi Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, matching consumers with independently established home services professionals engaged in a trade, occupation and/or businesses that customarily provides such services and provides consumers with tools to communicate with service professionals and pay for related services directly through Angi platforms; and 3) our Angi Services business allows consumers to browse and buy common household services at set prices directly from Angi, rather than requesting quotes, from service professionals (which we refer to as pre-priced offerings), as well as instantly book appointments with service professionals online for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) which are fulfilled by high-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals. The matching and pre-priced booking services and related tools and directories are provided to consumers free of charge. Angi Services also includes roof replacement services fulfilled via the Angi Roofing, LLC business.
As of December 31, 2021, Angi had a network of approximately 206,000 transacting service professionals (each of whom paid for consumer matches through Angi Leads and/or performed an Angi Services job in the quarter. In addition, our Angi Ads business had approximately 38,000 advertising service professionals under contract for advertising as of December 31, 2021.
Collectively, this service professional network provided services in more than 500 different categories, ranging from cleaning and installation services to simple home repairs and larger home remodeling projects, and in 64 discrete geographic areas in the United States. Angi Ads and Angi Leads generated approximately 33 million service requests during the year ended December 31, 2021. Service requests consist of fully completed domestic service requests submitted to Angi Leads and completed jobs sourced through Angi’s platforms.
Angi Ads Overview
Connecting consumers with service professionals for local services through the Angi nationwide online directory of service professionals across more than 500 service categories, as well as provides consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. Consumers can access the Angi nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge upon registration, as well as by way of purchased membership packages. Our Angi Ads business also sells term-based website and mobile and digital magazine advertising to service professionals, as well as provides them with quoting, invoicing, and payment services.
Consumer Services
Through our Angi Ads business, consumers who register for free can search for a service professional in the Angi nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional, as well as access related basic tools and services, ratings, reviews, and certain promotions. In addition, two premium membership packages are available for a fee, which include varying degrees of online and phone support, access to exclusive promotion features, and an award-winning Angi digital magazine. 
Consumers can rate service professionals listed in the Angi nationwide online directory on a one- to five- star rating scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are weighted across all reviews submitted for the service professional to produce such professional’s overall rating on Angi. Consumers can also provide a detailed description of (and commentary regarding) their experiences with service providers. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously, and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews.
Service Professional Services
Angi provides certified service professionals with a variety of services and tools, including quoting, invoicing, and payment services. Generally, service professionals with an average consumer rating below a “3” are not eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member rating, and owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks and attest to applicable licensure requirements.
Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must then purchase term-based advertising to obtain certification. As of December 31, 2021, Angi had approximately 38,000 certified service professionals under contract for advertising. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the applicable contract term, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process, and/or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any business, existing advertising and exclusive promotions will be suspended, and the related advertising contract will be subject to termination.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in the Angi nationwide online directory search results for an applicable category (together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information), with non-certified service professionals appearing below certified service professionals in directory search results. Certified service professionals can also provide exclusive promotions to members. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, Angi’s proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.
Angi Leads Overview
The Angi Leads (HomeAdvisor powered by Angi) digital marketplace (formerly known as the HomeAdvisor Marketplace) service connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. Our Angi Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online, connect with service professionals instantly by telephone, and access several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects.
Consumer Services
Consumers can submit a request to be matched with service professionals through the Angi Leads digital marketplace, as well as through certain paths on the Angi Ads and various third-party affiliate platforms. Depending on the nature of the service request and the path through which it was submitted, consumers are generally matched with service professionals from the Angi Leads digital marketplace, an Angi Services service professional or a combination of Angi Leads and Angi Ads service professionals (as and if available for the given service request).
Matches made through the Angi Leads and Angi Ads businesses and various third-party affiliate platforms and paths are made by way of Angi’s proprietary algorithm, based on several factors (including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request).
 In all cases, service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched directly and consumers can generally review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any Angi branded or third-party affiliate platforms.
Consumers are responsible for booking the service and for paying the service professional directly, which can be done by consumers independently or via the Angi Pay function in the Angi Pro Leads mobile app, through which consumers can also finance payments to service providers through a third party.
In addition to the general matching services described above, our Angi Leads business also provides several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect. Consumers can also access Angi’s online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content consisting primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals.
Service Professional Services
Angi Leads service professionals pay fees for consumer matches and subscription fees for Angi Leads memberships, which are available for purchase through our sales force. The basic annual membership package includes membership in the Angi Leads digital marketplace, as well as access to consumer matches (for which additional fees are paid) through Angi Leads and Angi Ads platforms, and a listing in the Angi Leads online directory and certain other affiliated directories. Membership also includes a business profile page on HomeAdvisor.com and Angi.com, a mobile application and access to various online tools designed to help service professionals more effectively market to, manage and connect with, consumers with whom they are matched. In addition to the commercial membership terms, in order to be admitted into the Angi Leads network, service professionals must validate their home services experiences, as well as satisfy credential verification of any required state-level licensing and the owner or principal passing certain criminal background checks. Once in the network, the service professional must maintain at least a three-star customer rating. If a service professional in the Angi Leads network fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the term of its contract, refuses to participate in the complaint resolution process, or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, the service professional is subject to being removed from the Angi network.
Angi Services Overview
Angi began offering pre-priced offerings after acquiring Handy Technologies, Inc. (“Handy”) on October 19, 2018. Angi Services was launched in August 2019 on the Angi platform. Angi Services provides a pre-priced booking service, whereby consumers can request services through either the Angi or Handy platforms and pay Angi or Handy for the services directly. Angi then fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services.
On July 1, 2021, Angi acquired certain assets and liabilities of Total Home Roofing, LLC. Upon completion of the acquisition, the acquired assets and liabilities were distributed to a newly created legal entity called Angi Roofing LLC, which operates as a part of Angi Services. Angi Roofing is a roof replacement and repair company serving the Florida market (a market leader) and to a limited extent Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana markets. 
Consumer Services
Consumers can submit requests for work to be done on the Handy and Angi apps and matches will be made through Handy platforms and paths based on the type of service desired, location and the date and time the consumer wants the service to be provided. In the case of Handy service professionals, consumers request services and pay for such services directly through the Handy platform and then Handy fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. In certain markets, consumers can also submit a request to book a specific Handy service professional for a given household service. 
In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third-party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Handy service professionals, which are then paid for directly through the applicable third-party retail partner platform.
Angi Roofing consumers are identified through lead generation services as well as organically through consumers that reach out directly. Consumers are able to receive roof replacement services, as well as a warranty on the quality of workmanship.
Service Professional Services
Angi Services service professionals, including those on the Handy platform, are provided with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals and must validate their home services experiences, as well as satisfy credential verification and a background check (either as an individual professional or as the owner or principal of the business) and maintain an acceptable rating to remain on the Angi and Handy platforms. Access to the platforms will be revoked for repeatedly receiving low customer satisfaction ratings.
Our International Businesses
We also operate several international businesses that connect consumers with home service professionals. These international businesses include: (i) Travaux, MyHammer and Werkspot, the leading home services marketplaces in France, Germany and the Netherlands, respectively, (ii) MyBuilder, and Instapro, leading home services marketplaces in the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively, and (iii) the Austrian operations of MyHammer. We own controlling interests in MyHammer and wholly-own MyBuilder, Travaux, Werkspot and Instapro. The business models of our international businesses vary by jurisdiction and differ in certain respects from Angi business models.
Revenue
Angi Ads and Leads Revenue is primarily derived from (i) advertising revenue, which includes revenue from service professionals under contract for advertising, (ii) consumer connection revenue, which is comprised of fees paid by service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service), and (iii) membership subscription revenue from service professionals and consumers. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered, and geographic location of service. Angi Services revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from jobs (i) sourced through the “Book Now” feature which lets consumers complete booking the entire transaction digitally for work that is completed physically, (ii) under managed projects (including Angi Roofing) which are home improvement projects, and (iii) through retail partnerships for installation of furniture or other household items.
Marketing
In March 2021, the Company changed its name to Angi Inc. and updated one of its leading websites and brands, Angie’s List, to Angi, and concentrated its marketing investment in the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales, and branding efforts to a single brand.
We market our various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily paid search engine marketing, display advertising and third-party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through e-mail and free search engine marketing. Pursuant to third-party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our products and services (and those of our service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through our platforms, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to us. We also market our products and services to consumers through relationships with select third-party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
We market Angi Leads matching services and membership subscriptions and Angi Ads’ term-based advertising and related products are marketed to service professionals primarily through our sales force. These products and services are also marketed, together with our Handy branded products and services and our pre-priced bookings and various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers.
Both generally, and in connection with the brand integration initiative describe below, we have made (and expect we will continue to make) substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote our products and services and drive visitors to our various platforms and service professionals.
Technology
Each of our brands and businesses develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor supported software technology. Each of our various brands and businesses has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and the creation of new features to support our products and services across a full range of devices (desktop, mobile web, native mobile applications and digital voice assistant platforms). Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative releases for product and service features.
Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. We compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe our biggest competition comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which are by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the ability to successfully implement the brand integration initiative;
•the ability of the Angi Services business to expand pre-priced booking services, while balancing the overall mix of service requests and directory services on Angi platforms generally;
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the breadth of our online directory listings;
•our ability to consistently generate service requests and pre-priced bookings through the Angi platforms that convert into revenue for our service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 
•our ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through our platforms, including our various mobile applications (rather than through search engine marketing or via free search engine referrals); 
•the functionality of our websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;
•our ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, our Angi brand; and
•the quality and consistency of our service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.
Intellectual Property 
We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and our marketing efforts.
We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of registered copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, trade secrets and patent applications, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions.
We have several registered trademarks in the United States (the most significant of which relate to our Angi and HomeAdvisor brands), as well as other trademarks in Canada and Europe, and several pending trademark applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our HomeAdvisor and Angi brands. In addition, we have one patent in the United States that expires in November 2035 and three patent applications pending in the United States. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of their users. As a result, we could be subject to claims based on negligence, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.
In addition, because we receive, transmit, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches. See “Item 1A-Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs.”
We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we 
provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and undermine open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, the United Kingdom’s proposed May 2021 Online Safety Bill, which like previous proposed legislation, seeks to create a new regulatory body responsible for establishing duties of care for Internet companies that provide user-generated content and for assessing related compliance. As proposed, failure to comply with the legislation could result in fines, blocking of services and personal liability for senior management. To the extent our businesses are required to implement new measures and/or make changes to our products and services to ensure compliance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Compliance with this legislation or similar or more stringent legislation in other jurisdictions could be costly, and the failure to comply could result in service interruptions and negative publicity, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) adopted an order reversing net neutrality protections in the United States, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. To the extent Internet service providers take such actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, there have been various legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change as a result. Any future adverse changes to Section 230 could result in additional compliance costs for us and/or exposure for additional liabilities.
We are also generally sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have recently adopted (or intend to adopt) proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which our European businesses are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including taxes based on a percentage of revenue). For example, we are subject to and pay the Digital Services Tax in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Similar proposed tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As a provider of products and services with a membership-based element, we are also sensitive to the adoption of laws and regulations affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments. For example, many U.S. states have considered enacting legislation that could impact the ability of our businesses to efficiently process auto-renewal payments for, as well as offer promotional or differentiated pricing. The adoption of any law that adversely affects revenue from recurring membership or subscription payments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations related to the adoption and interpretation of worker classification laws, specifically, laws that could effectively required us to change our classification of certain of our service professional from independent contractors to employees.
We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, e-mail, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and similar state laws, as well as federal, state, and local laws and agency guidelines governing background screening.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 5,200 full-time employees worldwide, the substantial majority of which provided services to our brands and businesses located in the United States. We also retain consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. 
Talent and Development
The development, attraction and retention of employees is critical to our success. We strive to provide an atmosphere that fosters teamwork and growth. We are investing in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs and encourage advancement from within. In 2020, we launched a Learning Management system for broader facilitation of training resources. We leverage both formal and informal programs designed to identify, foster, and retain top talent. We believe that our rich culture enables us to create, develop and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed consumer expectations and meet our growth objectives. We also place a high value on inclusion, engaging employees in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, or DEI, which is staffed by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in professional development, improving corporate culture and delivering sustained business results. Recent DEI initiatives include unconscious bias training and a women in leadership program.
Total Rewards and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, as well as health, welfare, and retirement benefits, vision, dental, life, prescription, and long-term disability insurance plans. We also provide employee paid supplemental life and accident insurance plans. To help employees cover medical expenses pre-tax, we offer employees a Flexible Spending Account. We also focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine, and fitness programs. We also offer our US-based full-time employees a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match.
Community
We encourage our employees to become involved in their communities by providing full-time employees eight hours of paid-time off each year to volunteer in local community-based programs. 
COVID Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly implemented safety and health standards and protocols for our employees to ensure a safe work environment. Employees in our offices have been working remotely since March 2020 and we have moved our sales employees to work fully remotely. When our corporate employees return to the office, we will adhere to the recommended protocols of the Centers for Disease Control or local regulations. We have offered paid leave for COVID-related illness that meet local requirements.
Ethics
Our employees are required to annually agree to comply with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and any deviations by our directors and executive officers are required to be approved by our Board. We also maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all of our employees to report (anonymously if desired) any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline (which is facilitated by an independent third party) are routed to appropriate functions (whether Human Resources, Legal or Finance) for investigation and resolution. In addition, any shareholder or other interested party may send communications to the Board of Directors, either individually or as a group, through a process that is outlined in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Additional Information
Company Website and Public Filings
We maintain a website at www.angi.com. Neither the information on this website, nor the information on the websites of any of our brands and businesses, is incorporated by reference into this annual report, or into any other filings with, or into any other information furnished or submitted to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

RELATIONSHIP WITH IAC
Equity Ownership and Vote
We have two classes of capital stock outstanding, Class A common stock and Class B common stock, with one vote and ten votes per share, respectively. Our shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a share for share basis. As of December 31, 2021, IAC owned all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock, and 2,588,180 outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, in total representing approximately 84.5% of our total outstanding shares of capital stock and approximately 98.2% of the total combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
Intercompany Agreements
In connection with the Combination, we and IAC entered into certain agreements to govern our relationship following the Combination. These agreements include the following:
Contribution Agreement
Under the contribution agreement: (i) we agreed to assume all of the assets and liabilities related to the HomeAdvisor business and indemnify IAC against any losses arising out of any breach by us of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below and (ii) IAC agreed to indemnify us against losses arising out of any breach by IAC of the contribution agreement or any other transaction related agreement described below.
Investor Rights Agreement
Under the investor rights agreement, IAC has certain registration, preemptive and governance rights related to us and the shares of our capital stock it holds. The investor rights agreement also provides certain governance rights for the benefit of stockholders other than IAC.
Services Agreement
The services agreement currently governs services that IAC has agreed to provide to us through September 29, 2021, with automatic renewal for successive one-year terms, subject to IAC’s continued ownership of a majority of the total combined voting power of our voting stock and any subsequent extension(s) or truncation(s) agreed to by us and IAC. The services agreement has been renewed through September 29, 2022. Services currently provided to us by IAC pursuant this agreement include: (i) assistance with certain legal, M&A, human resources, finance, risk management, internal audit and treasury functions, health and welfare benefits, information security services and insurance and tax affairs, including assistance with certain public company and unclaimed property reporting obligations; (ii) accounting, controllership and payroll processing services; (iii) investor relations services and (iv) tax compliance services. The scope, nature and extent of services may be changed from time to time as we and IAC may agree.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The tax sharing agreement governs our and IAC’s rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, entitlements to refunds, preparation of tax returns, tax contests and other tax matters regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. Under the tax sharing agreement, we are generally responsible and required to indemnify IAC for: (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes us or any of our subsidiaries (to the extent attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, as determined under the tax sharing agreement) and (ii) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of us or our subsidiaries.
Employee Matters Agreement
The employee matters agreement addresses certain compensation and benefit issues related to the allocation of liabilities associated with: (i) employment or termination of employment; (ii) employee benefit plans and (iii) equity awards. Under the employee matters agreement, our employees participate in IAC’s U.S. health and welfare plans, 401(k) plan and flexible benefits plan and we reimburse IAC for the costs of such participation. In the event IAC no longer retains shares representing at least 80% of the aggregate voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election of our board of directors, we will no longer participate in IAC’s employee benefit plans, but will establish our own employee benefit plans that will be substantially similar to the plans sponsored by IAC.
In addition, under the employee matters agreement, we are required to reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity awards held by our current and former employees, with IAC electing to receive payment either in cash or shares of our Class B common stock. This agreement also provides that IAC may require stock appreciation rights granted prior the closing of the Combination and equity awards in our subsidiaries to be settled in either shares of our Class A common stock or IAC common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of these awards, we are obligated to reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing shares of our Class A common stock in the case of stock appreciation rights granted prior to the closing of the Combination and shares of our Class B common stock in the case of equity awards in our subsidiaries.
Lastly, pursuant to the employee matters agreement, in the event of a distribution of Angi Inc. capital stock to IAC stockholders in a transaction intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Compensation Committee of the IAC board of directors has the exclusive authority to determine the treatment of outstanding IAC equity awards. Such authority includes (but is not limited to) the ability to convert all of part of IAC equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the distribution into equity awards denominated in shares of Angi Inc. Class A Common Stock, which Angi Inc. would be obligated to assume and which would be dilutive to Angi's stockholders.
