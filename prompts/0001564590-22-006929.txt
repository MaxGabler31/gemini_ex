Global Spine Principal Products
 The Global Spine reporting segment is largely represented by three principal product categories, i) Bone Growth Therapies, ii) Spinal Implants, and iii) Biologics. Each of these product categories are further described below:
Bone Growth Therapies
 Within the Bone Growth Therapies product category, we manufacture, distribute, and provide support services for market-leading bone growth stimulation devices that enhance bone fusion. These class III medical devices are indicated as an adjunctive, noninvasive treatment to improve fusion success rates in the cervical and lumbar spine as well as a therapeutic treatment for non-spinal, appendicular fractures that have not healed (nonunions). These devices utilize our patented pulsed electromagnetic field (“PEMF”) technology, the safety and efficacy of which is supported by basic mechanism of action data in the scientific literature, as well as published data from level one randomized controlled clinical trials. We sell these products almost exclusively in the U.S. using distributors and direct sales representatives to provide our devices to healthcare providers and their patients.
Spinal Implants
 Within the Spinal Implants product category, we design, develop, and market a portfolio of motion preservation and fixation implant products used in surgical procedures of the spine. We distribute these products globally through a network of distributors and sales representatives to sell spine products to facilities that conduct spine care to include hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, out-patient facilities (“spine care facilities”) and to surgeons who treat patients in need. 
 Biologics
 Within the Biologics product category, we offer a portfolio of products and tissue forms that allow physicians to successfully treat a variety of spinal and orthopedic conditions. We market tissue forms provided by MTF Biologics (“MTF”) to spine care facilities and surgeons, primarily in the U.S., through a network of independent distributors and sales representatives. Our partnership with MTF allows us to exclusively market the Trinity ELITE, Trinity Evolution, fiberFUSE, and fiberFUSE Strip tissue forms for musculoskeletal defects to enhance bony fusion.

Bone Growth Therapies — Spinal Therapy
 Our bone growth therapy devices used in spinal applications are designed to enhance bone growth and the success rate of certain spinal fusions by stimulating the body’s own natural healing mechanism post-surgically. These non-invasive portable devices are intended to be used as part of a home treatment program prescribed by a physician. 
 7


We offer two spinal fusion therapy devices: the SpinalStim and CervicalStim devices. Our stimulation products use a PEMF technology designed to enhance the growth of bone tissue following surgery and are placed externally over the site to be healed. Research data shows that our PEMF signal induces mineralization and results in a process that stimulates new regeneration at the spinal fusion site. Some spine fusion patients are at greater risk of not achieving a solid fusion of new bone around the fusion site. These patients typically have one or more risk factors such as smoking, obesity, or diabetes, or their surgery involves the revision of a failed fusion or the fusion of multiple levels of vertebrae in one procedure. For these patients, post-surgical bone growth therapy has been shown to significantly increase the probability of fusion success.
 The SpinalStim device is a non-invasive spinal fusion stimulator system designed for the treatment of the lumbar region of the spine. The device uses proprietary technology and a wavelength to generate a PEMF signal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved the SpinalStim system as a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a non-operative treatment for salvage of failed spinal fusion at least nine months post-operatively. 
 Our CervicalStim product remains the only FDA-approved bone growth stimulator on the market indicated for use as an adjunct to cervical spine fusion surgery. It is indicated for patients at high-risk for non-fusion. 
 The SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems are accompanied by an application for mobile devices called STIM onTrack. The mobile app includes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view patient adherence to prescribed treatment protocols and patient reported outcome measures. Designed for use with smartphones and other mobile devices, the STIM onTrack tool helps patients follow their prescription with daily treatment reminders and a device usage calendar. The app is free and available through the iTunes App Store. 
 Bone Growth Therapies — Orthopedic Therapy 
 Our PhysioStim bone healing therapy products use PEMF technology similar to that used in our spine stimulators. The primary difference is that the PhysioStim devices are designed for use on the appendicular skeleton. 
 A bone’s regenerative power results in most fractures healing naturally within a few months. However, in the presence of certain risk factors, some fractures do not heal or heal slowly, resulting in “nonunions.” Traditionally, orthopedists have treated such nonunion conditions surgically, often by means of a bone graft with fracture fixation devices, such as bone plates, screws, or intramedullary rods. These are examples of “invasive” treatments. Our patented PhysioStim bone healing therapy products are designed to use a low level of PEMF signals to noninvasively activate the body’s natural healing process. The devices are anatomically designed, allowing ease of placement, patient mobility, and the ability to cover a large treatment area. 
 Similar to our SpinalStim and CervicalStim systems, the PhysioStim device is also accompanied by the STIM onTrack mobile app, enabling physicians treating patients with nonunion fractures to remotely view and assess patient adherence to prescribed treatment protocols and patient reported outcome measures.
 Spinal Implants — Motion Preservation Solutions
 In 2018, we acquired Spinal Kinetics Inc., a privately held developer and manufacturer of artificial cervical and lumbar discs, namely the M6-C cervical and M6-L lumbar artificial discs, which are used to treat patients suffering from degenerative disc disease of the spine. The M6 discs are the only FDA-approved artificial discs that mimic the anatomic structure of a natural disc by incorporating an artificial viscoelastic nucleus and fiber annulus into their design. Like a natural disc, this unique construct allows for shock absorption at the implanted level, as well as provides a controlled range of motion when the spine transitions in its combined complex movements. Both discs have European Commission CE mark approval and prior to 2019, had historically been exclusively distributed outside the U.S. In February 2019, we received FDA approval of the M6-C artificial cervical disc to treat patients with a single-level cervical disc degeneration. We released the M6-C artificial cervical disc in the U.S. in 2019 through a controlled market launch accompanied by an extensive training and education curriculum for surgeons. The M6-C disc has become our leading spinal implant device and contributed significantly to our growth in 2021. In addition, we have initiated a U.S. 2-level investigational device exemption (“IDE”) study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc.

Spinal Implants — Spinal Repair Solutions 
 We provide a wide array of implants designed for use primarily in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar fusion surgeries. These implants are made of either metal or a thermoplastic compound called PEEK. The majority of the implants that we offer are made of titanium metal. The Firebird Spinal Fixation System, the Phoenix Minimally Invasive Spinal Fixation System, and the Centurion POCT Systems are sets of rods, cross connectors, and screws that are implanted during posterior fusion procedures. The Firebird Modular and pre-assembled Spinal Fixation Systems are designed to be used in either open or minimally-invasive posterior lumbar fusion procedures with our ProView MAP System. To complement our plates, rods, and screw fixation options, we offer an entire portfolio of cervical and thoracolumbar PEEK interbody devices within our Pillar and Forza product lines.  This interbody portfolio includes two stand-alone devices, Lonestar and Pillar SA, as well as the Construx Mini PTC system, a novel titanium composite spacer, which offers a superior alternative to other plasma spray coated options currently available on the market.  We also offer specialty plates and screws that are used in less common procedures, and as such, are not manufactured by many device makers.  
Biologics — Regenerative Solutions 
 The premier biologics tissues we market include the Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution tissue forms, which are cortical cancellous allografts that retain the inherent growth factors and viable cells found in bone. They are used during surgery in the treatment of musculoskeletal defects for bone reconstruction and repair. These allografts are intended to offer a viable alternative to an autograft procedure, as harvesting autograft has been shown to add risk of an additional surgical procedure and related patient discomfort in conjunction with a repair surgery. 
 The fiberFUSE tissue is the newest biologics tissue form with handling characteristics analogous to the Trinity ELITE product without compromising bone content. It provides an advanced demineralized bone offering that leverages fiber technology with the advantages of ingrowth that cancellous bone provides and expands the offering to address a broader scope of surgical applications. This tissue offering was developed by MTF in close collaboration with Orthofix to expand our portfolio and provides an opportunity to serve a great number of clinical indications addressed by surgeons.
 We receive marketing fees through our collaboration with MTF for the Trinity ELITE, Trinity Evolution, fiberFUSE, AlloQuent, and VersaShield tissues. MTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals, surgery centers, and other points of care for service fees, which are submitted by customers via purchase orders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to market the Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution tissue forms and exclusive rights to market the fiberFUSE and AlloQuent tissues in the U.S. We market the VersaShield tissue under a private label brand via a non-exclusive marketing agreement for the tissue form. 
 To date, our Biologics products are offered primarily in the U.S. market due in part to restrictions on providing U.S. human donor tissue in other countries.
 Future Product Applications
 We remain very active with multiple internal developments to support future, new technology commercialization efforts. These new technologies will apply to both the cervical and thoracolumbar spinal anatomy. In addition, we remain active in evaluating external licensing and acquisition opportunities to add implant, biologics, and other emerging technologies to our spine portfolio. We expect that the contribution of new, internally developed technologies and undefined external acquisitions will be the primary driver of future growth. 
 Regarding our Bone Growth Therapy business, we have sponsored research at the University of Pennsylvania, Cleveland Clinic, New York University, and University of California San Francisco, where scientists conducted animal and cellular studies to identify the mechanisms of action of our PEMF signals on bone and tendon and efficacy of healing. From these efforts, many studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Among other insights, the studies illustrate positive effects of PEMF on callus formation and bone strength as well as proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in regeneration and healing. Furthermore, we believe that the research work with Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania, allowing for characterization and visualization of the Orthofix PEMF waveform, is paving the way for signal optimization for a variety of new applications and indications. This collection of pre-clinical data, along with additional clinical data, could represent new clinical indication opportunities for our regenerative stimulation solutions. In addition, we currently have research and a clinical study underway to identify potential clinical indications for treating rotator cuff tears and we also have initiated a U.S. 2-Level IDE study for the M6-C artificial cervical disc.

 We provide internal and external fixation solutions for extremity repair and deformity correction, both for adults and children. Our fracture repair products consist of fixation devices designed to stabilize a broken bone until it can heal. With these devices, we can treat simple and complex fracture patterns, along with achieving deformity corrections. 
 External Fixation 
 External fixation devices are used to stabilize fractures and offer an ideal treatment for complex fractures, fractures near the joints, and in patients with known risk factors or co-morbidities. The treatment is minimally invasive and allows external manipulation of the bone to obtain and maintain final bone alignment (reduction). The bone is fixed in this way until healing occurs. External fixation allows small degrees of micromotion (dynamization), which promotes blood flow at the fracture site, and accelerates the bone healing process. External fixation devices may also be used temporarily in complex trauma cases to stabilize the fracture prior to treating it definitively. In these situations, the device offers rapid fracture stabilization, which is important in life-saving as well as limb salvage procedures. 
 We offer most of our products in sterile packaging, which fulfills the need of a streamlined and ready-to-use set of products, particularly in trauma applications where timing is crucial.
 Examples of our external fixation devices include the TrueLok, TL-HEX, the Galaxy Fixation System, and the LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System.
 Internal Fixation
 Internal fixation devices consist of either long rods, commonly referred to as nails, or plates that are attached to the bone with the use of screws. Nails and plates come in various sizes, depending on the bone that requires treatment. A nail is inserted into the medullary canal of a fractured long bone of the human arm or leg (e.g., humerus, femur, or tibia). Alternatively, a plate is attached by screws to an area such as a broken wrist, hip, or foot. Examples of our internal fixation devices include Chimaera, AHN, and the G-BEAM Fusion Beaming System. 
 Acquired in March 2020, the FITBONE intramedullary lengthening nail provides an internal option for limb lengthening of the femur and tibia and provides Orthofix with the most complete limb reconstruction portfolio on the market. Over 3,500 cases have been performed with the FITBONE system in more than 15 countries.
 12


In addition to treating bone fractures, we also design, manufacture and distribute devices intended to treat congenital bone conditions, such as angular deformities (e.g., bowed legs in children), degenerative diseases, and conditions resulting from a previous trauma. An example of a product offered in this area is the eight-Plate Plus. 
 Product Development
 Our primary research and development facilities are located in Lewisville, Texas and Verona, Italy. We work with leading hospital research institutions, as well as with MTF Biologics, surgeons, and other consultants, on the long-term scientific planning and evolution of our products and therapies. Several of the products that we market have been developed through these collaborations. In addition, we periodically receive suggestions for new products and product enhancements from the scientific and medical community, some of which result in us entering into assignment or license agreements with physicians and third parties.
 In 2021, 2020, and 2019, we incurred research and development expenses of $49.6 million, $39.1 million, and $34.6 million, respectively.
 Patents, Trade Secrets, Assignments and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, assignment and license agreements, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We possess numerous U.S. and foreign patents, have numerous pending patent applications, and have license rights under patents held by third parties. Our primary products are patented in the major markets in which they are sold. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position. The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Our success is dependent, in part, on us not infringing upon patents issued to others, including our competitors and potential competitors. While we make extensive efforts to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors. For a further discussion of these risks, please see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 We rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. 
 We obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third parties. We typically acquire rights under such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay a percentage of sales to the licensor. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, no assurance can be given that these arrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and assignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years, to the life of product patents, or for the economic life of the product. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach. 
 Compliance and Ethics Program 
 It is our fundamental policy to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. We have a comprehensive compliance and ethics program, which is overseen by our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. The program is intended to promote lawful and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. It is designed to prevent and detect violations of applicable federal, state, and local laws in accordance with the standards set forth in guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (“U.S. DOJ”) (“Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs” (updated June 2020)), the Office of Inspector General (HCCA-OIG “Measuring Compliance Program Effectiveness: A Resource Guide” (March 2017)), and the U.S. Sentencing Commission (“Effective Compliance and Ethics Programs” (November 2014)).

Government Regulation
 Classification and Approval of Products by the FDA and other Regulatory Authorities
 Our research, development, and clinical programs, and our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our products and facilities vary widely from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we commercially distribute in the U.S. is covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance, letter to file, approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), or some other approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, which generally determine the type of FDA approval required. Devices deemed to pose low risk are placed in class I, while devices that are considered to pose moderate risk are placed in class II, and devices deemed to pose the greatest risks, requiring more regulatory controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a device that previously received 510(k) clearance (as described below), are placed in class III. Our Spinal Implants and Global Orthopedics products are, for the most part, class II devices and the instruments used in conjunction with these products are generally class I. Our Bone Growth Therapies products and the M6-C artificial cervical disc are currently classified as class III by the FDA, and have been approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. through the PMA process. However, an FDA panel recently recommended that bone growth stimulator devices be reclassified by the FDA from Class III to Class II devices with special controls. For additional discussion of this development, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” 
 The medical devices we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe we have obtained all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our products and that they are in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. 
 
In 2017, the European Union (“E.U.”) adopted the E.U. Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation provided a transition period that went into effect on May 2021 for all currently-approved medical devices prior to May 2021 (under the European Medical Device Directive) to meet the additional requirements and for certain devices this transition period was extended until May 2024. After this transition period, all medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements. Compliance with this new regulation has required us to incur significant costs over the transition period and we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with this effort through May 2024. Failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the E.U. and other countries that utilize or rely on E.U. requirements for medical device registrations.
 Within our Biologics product category, we market tissue for bone repair and reconstruction under the brand names Trinity ELITE and Trinity Evolution, our allogeneic bone matrices comprised of cancellous bone containing viable stem cells and a demineralized cortical bone component. In addition, we provide structural allografts for spinal fusion under the brand name AlloQuent, demineralized cortical fiber technologies under the brand name fiberFUSE, and an amniotic membrane, VersaShield, which is a natural tissue barrier. These allografts are regulated under the FDA’s Human Cell, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, or HCT/P, regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device, biologic, or a drug. These tissues are regulated by the FDA as minimally-manipulated tissue and are covered by the FDA’s “Good Tissues Practices” regulations, which cover all stages of allograft processing. There can be no assurance our suppliers will continue to meet applicable regulatory requirements or that those requirements will not be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business. Further, there can be no assurance these products will continue to 
 14


be made available to us or that applicable regulatory standards will be met or remain unchanged. Moreover, products derived from human tissue or bones are from time to time subject to recall for certain administrative or safety reasons and we may be affected by one or more such recalls.
 In addition to our allograft solutions (HCT/Ps), we market and distribute additional biologics products that are synthetic in nature and are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, specifically Collage Synthetic Osteoconductive Matrix and the Opus MG line of synthetic grafts. We also provide ancillary technologies regulated by the FDA as medical devices that aid in the delivery of our bone grafting options clinically. These products are sourced from third party manufacturers, which we believe adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow disruptions. 
 For a further description of some of these risks, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.” 
 Certain Other Product and Manufacturing Regulations 
 After a device is placed in the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include: product listing and establishment registration; Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations and governmental prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our PMA approved devices; Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA and other foreign governmental agencies if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions, order device manufacturers to recall a product from the market that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals. 
 We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified Bodies to determine our compliance with the FDA’s QSR and other international regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees, or our suppliers; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. In addition to FDA inspections, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to annual Notified Body inspections. 
 Moreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices. Our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. Such additional regulation, whether in the U.S. or internationally, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For a description of some of these risks, see Item 1A of this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”
 Accreditation Requirements 
 Our subsidiary, Orthofix US LLC, has been accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (“ACHC”) for medical supply provider services with respect to durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (“DMEPOS”). ACHC, a private, not-for-profit corporation, which is certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards, was developed by home care and community-based providers to help companies improve business operations and quality of patient care. Although accreditation is generally a voluntary activity, where healthcare organizations submit to peer review their internal policies, processes, and patient care delivery against national standards, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) required DMEPOS suppliers to become accredited. We believe that by attaining accreditation, Orthofix US LLC has demonstrated its commitment to maintain a higher level of competency and a willingness to strive for excellence in its products, services, and customer satisfaction.
 15


Third-Party Payor Requirements
Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, non-government third-party payors are increasingly challenging the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain DMEPOS items via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. Bone growth therapy devices are currently exempt from this competitive bidding process. 
Laws Regulating Healthcare Fraud and Abuse; State Healthcare Laws 
 Our sales and marketing practices are also subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the “Stark Law”), the Civil False Claims Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. These laws are enforced by the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the U.S. DOJ, and other federal, state, and local agencies. Among other things, these laws and others generally (i) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients or for the purchase, order, or recommendation of any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (ii) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; (iii) prohibit the transmission of protected healthcare information to persons not authorized to receive that information; and (iv) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits. 
Laws Protecting the Confidentiality of Health Information 
 U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the HHS promulgates health information privacy and security rules under HIPAA. These rules protect health information by regulating its use and disclosure, including for research and other purposes. Failure of a HIPAA “covered entity” to comply with HIPAA regarding such “protected health information” could constitute a violation of federal law, subject to civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities include healthcare providers (including certain of those that sell devices or equipment) that engage in particular electronic transactions, including, as we do, the transmission of claims to health plans. Consequently, health information that we access, collect, analyze, and otherwise use and/or disclose includes protected health information that is subject to HIPAA. As noted above, many state laws also pertain to the confidentiality of health information. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, in particular those state laws that afford greater privacy protection to the individual than HIPAA. These state laws typically have their own penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information. 
 In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data.
 These laws and regulations impact the ways in which we use and manage personal data, protected health information, and our information technology systems. They also impact our ability to move, store, and access data across geographic boundaries. Compliance with these requirements may require changes in business practices, complicate our operations, and add complexity and additional management and oversight needs. They also may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Provision of the Affordable Care Act (Section 6002) (the “Sunshine Act”), requires public disclosure to the U.S. government of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals, including in-kind transfers of value, such as gifts or meals. The Sunshine Act also provides penalties for non-compliance. The Sunshine Act requires that we file an annual report on March 31st of a calendar year for the transfers of value incurred for the prior calendar year.
 In 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”) was signed into law. The SUPPORT Act expands the reporting obligation under the Sunshine Act to include 
 16


payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. These expanded reporting obligations are effective for payments reported in 2022, with payment tracking beginning in 2021. Non-compliance with the Sunshine Act or SUPPORT Act is subject to civil monetary penalties.
 In addition to the Sunshine Act, as expanded by the SUPPORT Act, we seek to comply with other international and individual state transparency laws, such as Massachusetts and Vermont.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 General Trends 
 We believe that demographic trends, principally in the form of a better informed, more active, and aging population in the major healthcare markets of the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan, together with opportunities in emerging markets such as the Asia-Pacific Region and Latin America, as well as our focus on innovative products, will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for our products. 
Reporting Segments and Product Categories 
 Our revenues are generated from the sales of products in our two reporting segments, Global Spine and Global Orthopedics. Further, our Global Spine reporting segment is comprised of three primary product categories: Bone Growth Therapies, Spinal Implants, and Biologics. See the following chart for the distribution of sales between each of our reporting segments and product categories for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Sales Network 
 We have a broad sales network comprised of direct sales representatives, sales agents, and distributors. This established sales network provides us with a platform to introduce new products and expand sales of existing products. We distribute our products worldwide in more than 60 countries. 
 17


In our largest market, the U.S., our sales network is generally comprised of four sales forces, each addressing one of our primary product categories; however, an increasing number of independent distributors sell products for more than one of our product categories. Within our Global Spine reporting segment, a hybrid distribution network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors sells products in our Bone Growth Therapies product category, while primarily independent distributors sell products in our Spinal Implants and Biologics product categories. In the U.S., our Global Orthopedics reporting segment products are primarily sold by independent distributors.
 Outside the U.S., we employ direct sales representatives and contract with independent distributors. In order to provide support to our independent sales network, we have sales and product specialists who regularly visit independent distributors to provide training and product support. 
 Marketing and Product Education
 We market and sell our products principally to physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, integrated health delivery systems, and other purchasing organizations. 
 We support our sales force through specialized training workshops in which physicians and sales specialists participate. We also produce marketing and training materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our customers, sales force, and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video, and multimedia formats. We require all of our sales force, direct and independent, to undergo extensive product, policy, and compliance training to ensure adherence to our standards, policies, and applicable law.
 To provide additional advanced training for physicians, consistent with the AdvaMed Code of Ethics (“AdvaMed Code”) and the MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice (“MedTech Code”), we organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations and also virtually. In person training locations include our facility in Verona, Italy, various locations in Latin America, and our corporate headquarters in Lewisville, Texas. In recent years, thousands of surgeons from around the world have attended these in person and virtual product education seminars, which have included a variety of lectures from specialists, as well as demonstrations and hands-on workshops. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales and training teams also offered virtual training opportunities and we have participated in numerous virtual sales conferences. We plan to continue to utilize these virtual training platforms into the future.
 Competition
 Our Bone Growth Therapies product category competes principally with similar products marketed by Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; DJO, LLC; and Bioventus LLC. The Biologics HCT/P and Spinal Implants products we market compete with products marketed by Medtronic, Inc.; DePuy Synthes, a division of Johnson and Johnson; Stryker Corp.; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; NuVasive, Inc.; Globus Medical Inc.; and various smaller public and private companies. For Global Orthopedics devices, our principal competitors include DePuy Synthes; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; Stryker Corp.; Smith & Nephew plc; and OrthoPediatrics Corp. 
 We believe that we enhance our competitive position by focusing on product features such as ease of use, versatility, cost, and patient acceptability, together with value-added services, such as the STIM onTrack mobile app, HEX RAY software, OrthoNEXT preoperative planning, and our medical education services. We attempt to avoid competing based solely on price. Overall cost and medical effectiveness, innovation, reliability, value-added service, and training are the most prevalent methods of competition in the markets for our products, and we believe we compete effectively.  
 Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 
 We generally design, develop, assemble, test, and package our bone growth stimulation, motion preservation, orthopedic, and spinal implant products, and subcontract the manufacturing of a substantial portion of the component parts and instruments. Although certain of our key raw materials are obtained from a single source, we believe alternate sources for these materials are available. Further, we believe an adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow interruptions. Historically, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the materials necessary to meet our production schedules. 
 We partner with MTF Biologics to provide our customers allograft solutions (HCT/Ps) for various spine, orthopedic and other bone repair needs. MTF Biologics provides donor screening, processing, and quality standards that are expected by our customers. We are the exclusive marketing representative for the Trinity ELITE, Trinity Evolution, fiberFUSE, and AlloQuent HCT/Ps and have a non-exclusive marketing agreement for our Versashield amniotic membrane.
 18


Our products are currently manufactured and assembled in the U.S. and Italy. We believe our plants comply in all material respects with the requirements of the FDA and all relevant regulatory authorities outside the U.S. For a description of the laws to which we are subject, see Item 1, “Business”, under the subheadings “Corporate Compliance and Ethics Program” and “Government Regulation.” We actively monitor each of our subcontractors in order to maintain manufacturing and quality standards and product specification conformity. 
 Human Capital Resources
 Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion principles and practices into our core values.
Employees
 At December 31, 2021, we had 1,087 employees worldwide. Of these, 786 were employed in the U.S. and 301 were employed at other non-U.S. locations. Our relations with our Italian employees, who numbered 208 at December 31, 2021, are governed by the provisions of a National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal mechanic workers industry. We are not a party to any other collective bargaining agreement. 
Compensation and Benefits
 Because attracting, developing, and retaining high-level talent is a key component of our human capital objectives, we seek to provide competitive compensation and benefits packages, and to prioritize the health and wellness our employees. In addition to the comprehensive and competitive health plans that we offer, our employees receive access to the following benefits: a 401(k) retirement plan with a Company match, an employee stock purchase plan, virtual physician consults, an employee health advocate, a Company-provided basic life insurance and disability benefits corporate wellness program, an onsite fitness center, paid parental leave, an employee assistance program, a flexible spending account, health savings accounts, and local employee discounts programs.
Talent Development
 We believe that success comes from investing in our people and ensuring our workforce is aligned with our mission and values. To achieve this goal, we devote time and resources to assist our employees in being familiar with our business, industry, and product offerings. We put an emphasis on training our employees and sales representatives to understand our business, including the underlying medical conditions that our products treat. In addition, we strive to support our teams in the areas of development, mentoring, engagement, and health and wellness, enabling them to do their best work as they grow their careers. In 2021, we launched an internship program with a diversity, equity, and inclusion focus and a global mentorship program to employees across all departments.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 The Company’s mission is to deliver innovative, quality-driven solutions as we partner with health care professionals to improve patient mobility. It is our corporate values and the diverse individuals who bring these values to life that make our high-achieving capabilities a reality. We are committed to fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. We seek to demonstrate our commitment to providing equal and equitable opportunities to all employees through programs such as our Moving 4ward initiative, a program created to embrace the value of diversity and reflect the communities where we live and work. Additionally, we proudly support the Orthofix Women’s Network, a program that provides opportunities for women to learn from each other and grow within our company and our industry. Throughout the year, we promote a variety of diverse voices to our employees by recognizing events such as Black History Month, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Women’s History Month, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, LGBTQ Pride Month, Juneteenth, and Hispanic Heritage Month. We seek to embrace and encourage our employees’ differences and know that diversity, equity and inclusion help build a truly global, transformative business and will continue to be a source of our strength. Building on this belief, all employees participated in an unconscious bias training in 2021 to increase awareness and promote equity and inclusion amongst employees. 
Health and Safety
 Promoting and protecting the safety of our workforce is a top priority. Health and safety is a responsibility that we share throughout our organization and it is a responsibility that has evolved during the last two years to meet the needs of our workforce during the 
 19


COVID-19 pandemic. Employees’ safety risks vary depending on the roles they perform, and we seek to tailor our safety efforts accordingly.
 Community
 We support a variety of charitable organizations through donations, fundraising efforts, educational partnerships with colleges and universities, and local community development. Over the years, we have raised funds and awareness for veteran support groups, food and homebuilding organizations, and health-related institutions. In 2020, we initiated a global food drive in response to food shortages caused by the pandemic. Through employee donations and matching funds we provided meaningful support to 20 food banks around the world. Orthofix also partners with Donate Life America, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that promotes the importance of organ, eye, and tissue donation. Additionally, we have an ongoing engineering partnership with the University of Texas, Dallas, enabling students to work on real life healthcare solutions as we invest in the next generation of engineers and business leaders.
