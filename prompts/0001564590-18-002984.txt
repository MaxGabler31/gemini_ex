ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS
 We were founded in 1846 and incorporated in Delaware in 1925.  We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care products and specialty products focused on animal productivity, chemicals and cleaners. Our consumer products marketing efforts are focused principally on our 11 “power brands.” These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; TROJAN condoms, lubricants and vibrators; OXICLEAN stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergents and bleach alternatives; SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes; FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; NAIR depilatories; ORAJEL oral analgesic; XTRA laundry detergent; the combination of the L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION brand names for the our gummy dietary supplement business; BATISTE dry shampoo; and WATERPIK water flossers and showerheads. 
 We sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and the Specialty Products Division (“SPD”). Our segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.  The table set forth below shows the percentage of our net sales contributed by each segment and each group of similar products marketed by us during 2017, 2016 and 2015:

 | % of Net Sales
-----------------------+---------------
 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Consumer Domestic | | | 
Household Products | 44% | 46% | 45% 
Personal Care Products | 32% | 31% | 31% 
Consumer International | 16% | 15% | 15% 
Specialty Products | 8% | 8% | 9% 

 

Additional information concerning the results of each of our segments is set forth in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and in “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 All domestic brand “rankings” contained in this Annual Report are based on dollar share rankings from ACNielsen AOC (All Outlets Combined) for the 52 weeks ended December 17, 2017. Foreign brand “rankings” are derived from several sources.
 
Recent Acquisitions
 We made two consumer products acquisitions in 2017.  On January 17, 2017, we acquired the VIVISCAL brand (the “Viviscal Acquisition”), the number one non-drug hair growth supplement in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, from Lifes2good Holdings Limited for $160 million.  On August 7, 2017, we acquired the WATERPIK brand (the “Waterpik Acquisition”) for approximately $1 billion.  WATERPIK is the number one water flosser and replacement showerhead brand in the U.S.
 Additionally, on May 1, 2017, we acquired Agro BioSciences, Inc. (the “Agro Acquisition”), an innovator and leader in developing custom probiotic products for poultry, cattle and swine.
 
Consumer Domestic
 Our founders first marketed sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda, in 1846 for use in home baking. Today, this product has a wide variety of uses in the home, including as a refrigerator and freezer deodorizer, scratch-free cleaner and deodorizer 
 4


for kitchen surfaces and cooking appliances, bath additive, dentifrice, cat litter deodorizer and swimming pool pH stabilizer. We specialize in baking soda-based products, as well as other products which use the same raw materials or technology or which are sold in the same markets.  Our Consumer Domestic segment includes each of our 11 power brands, as well as other well-known brands and household and personal care products.  We divide the Consumer Domestic segment into household and personal care product groups.  
 Household Products 
 In 2017, household products constituted approximately 57% of our Domestic Consumer sales and approximately 44% of our consolidated net sales. 
 ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda remains the number one leading brand of baking soda in terms of consumer recognition of the brand name and reputation for quality and value. The deodorizing properties of baking soda have led to the development of numerous baking soda-based household products. For example, we market ARM & HAMMER FRIDGE FRESH, a refrigerator deodorizer equipped with a baking soda filter to help keep food tasting fresher, and ARM & HAMMER Carpet Deodorizer.  Our other primary household products include laundry detergents marketed under the ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN and XTRA brands, fabric softener sheets marketed under the ARM & HAMMER and NICE’N FLUFFY b
rands, cat litter under our ARM & HAMMER brand, and household cleaning products under the CLEAN SHOWER, SCRUB FREE, ORANGE GLO, OXICLEAN and KABOOM brands.  Our laundry detergents constitute our largest consumer business, measured by net sales. 
Personal Care Products
 In 2017, personal care products constituted approximately 43% of our Consumer Domestic sales and approximately 32% of our consolidated net sales.
 Our personal care business was founded on the unique strengths of our ARM & HAMMER trademark and baking soda technology. We have expanded our personal care business through the acquisition of antiperspirants, oral care products, depilatories, reproductive health products, oral analgesics, nasal saline moisturizers and dietary supplements under a variety of other leading brand names. 
 ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, when used as a dentifrice, helps whiten and polish teeth, removes plaque and leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean. These properties led to the development of a complete line of sodium bicarbonate-based dentifrice products that are marketed and sold nationally primarily under the ARM & HAMMER brand name. Our other personal care products include antiperspirants and deodorants under the ARRID and ARM & HAMMER brands, condoms under the TROJAN brand (the number one condom brand in the U.S.), battery-operated toothbrushes under the SPINBRUSH brand (the number one leading brand of battery-operated toothbrushes in the U.S. in 2017), water flossers and showerheads under the WATERPIK brand (the number one water flosser and replacement showerhead brand in the U.S.), home pregnancy and ovulation test kits under the FIRST RESPONSE brand (the number one selling brand in the U.S.), hair-removal products under the NAIR brand, oral analgesics and oral care products under the ORAJEL brand (the market leader in the toothache, canker sore, and children’s teething categories in the U.S.), children’s gummy dietary supplements under the L’IL CRITTERS brand and adult gummy dietary supplements under the VITAFUSION brand (both number one leading brands in their respective categories), a growing number of hair products under the BATISTE, VIVISCAL, TOPPIK (the number one leading brand of cosmetics for thinning hair), and XFUSION brands, and nasal saline moisturizers and solutions under the SIMPLY SALINE and STERIMAR brands. 
Consumer International
 Our Consumer International segment markets a variety of personal care products, household and over-the-counter products in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, China, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil. Export sales from the U.S. are included in this segment. 
 Total Consumer International net sales represented approximately 16% of our consolidated net sales in 2017.  Net sales of the businesses located in Europe, Canada, Mexico and Australia accounted for 33%, 30%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our 2017 international net sales in this segment. No other country in which we operate accounts for more than 10% of our total international net sales and no product line accounts for more than 20% of total international net sales.
 Certain of our international product lines are similar to our domestic product lines and many are unique. For example, in addition to selling these brands in the U.S., we market our ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN laundry products and TROJAN condoms in Canada and Mexico, ARM & HAMMER cat litter in Canada, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and oral care products in most of our international markets, waxes and depilatory products in virtually all international locations and L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy dietary supplements principally in Canada and Asia. 
 5


We also market SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes internationally, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, China and Australia. We sell STERIMAR nasal hygiene products in a number of markets in Europe, as well as in Mexico, parts of Asia and Australia and other international markets. We also sell BATISTE dry shampoo principally in the United Kingdom, where it is the number one selling dry shampoo, Australia, Canada, France, Brazil, China and Mexico, as well as other markets including the U.S. We also market the CURASH line of babycare products in Australia, and GRAVOL anti-nauseant and RUB-A535 topical analgesic in Canada and other international markets. 
 Specialty Products Division 
 Our SPD segment focuses on sales to businesses and participates in three product areas: Animal Productivity, Specialty Chemicals and Specialty Cleaners, and accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Animal Productivity Products 
 Since the ARM & HAMMER animal productivity business began in 1972, with its launch of ARM & HAMMER baking soda as a feed additive to help dairy cows produce more milk, we have built a leading portfolio of nutritional supplements designed to help improve the health and productivity of dairy cows.  Today our portfolio of dairy nutritional supplements includes brands such as MEGALAC rumen bypass fat (licensed from Volac International Limited) – a supplement made from natural oils – which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production, resulting in improved milk yields.  In addition, we market a line of high quality protein and amino acid products, including BIO-CHLOR and FERMENTEN, which are designed to help reduce health issues associated with calving as well as provide needed protein to ensure proper growth and milk production.
 Over the last five years, we have been successful at expanding our product offerings to include unique prebiotics and probiotics.  CELMANAX Refined Functional Carbohydrate is a yeast based prebiotic that helps ensure a well-functioning gastrointestinal track in dairy cows, beef cattle, poultry and other livestock.  On May 1, 2017, we acquired the Agro Biosciences, Inc. business and we now market the CERTILLUS family of probiotics products in the poultry, dairy, beef and swine industries.  
 Specialty Chemicals
 Our specialty chemicals business primarily encompasses the manufacture, marketing and sale of sodium bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial markets. In industrial markets, sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods, as an antacid in pharmaceuticals, as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers, as an alkaline agent in swimming pool chemicals, and as a buffer in kidney dialysis. 
 We and Occidental Chemical Corporation are equal partners in a joint venture, Armand, which manufactures and markets potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate for sale in domestic and international markets. The potassium-based products are used in a wide variety of applications, including agricultural products, specialty glass and ceramics, and potassium silicates. Armand also manufactures for the Company a potassium carbonate-based animal feed additive for sale in the dairy industry, described above under “Animal Productivity Products.”Specialty Cleaners
 We also provide a line of cleaning and deodorizing products for use in commercial and industrial applications such as office buildings, hotels, restaurants and other facilities.
 We and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) are equal partners in a joint venture, ArmaKleen, which has built a specialty cleaning products business based on our technology and Safety-Kleen’s sales and distribution organization. In North America, this joint venture distributes our proprietary product line of aqueous cleaners along with our ARMEX blast media line, which is designed for the removal of a wide variety of surface coatings. 
COMPETITION
 We compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories, which are highly innovative categories, characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions, and require significant advertising and promotion. We compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance, brand recognition, price, value and other consumer benefits. Consumer products, particularly laundry and dietary supplements, are subject to significant price competition. As a result, we, from time to time, may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share.  Product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch, and we usually are 
 6


not able to determine whether the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line.
 Because of the competitive environment facing retailers, we face pricing pressure from customers, particularly high-volume retailer store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. These concessions or terms could reduce our margins. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers, they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us, which would harm our sales and profitability.
 Our competitors in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments include P&G, The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., Nestle Purina PetCare Company, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Johnson & Johnson, Ansell Limited, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Alere Inc., NBTY, Inc. and Pharmavite LLC. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share.
 Competition within our specialty chemicals and animal productivity product lines is intense. The specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization, customers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs. Product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch, and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines. Our key competitors with respect to our SPD segment are Archer Daniel Midland Co, Diamond V, Lallemand Inc., Solvay Chemicals, Inc., Genesis Alkali and Natural Soda, Inc.
 DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS
 Our Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments products are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, pharmacies and drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores, and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. The Consumer Domestic Segment employs a sales force based regionally throughout the U.S. and utilizes the services of independent food brokers, who represent our products in the food, mass, pet, dollar and club, as well as numerous other classes of trade. Our Consumer International distribution network is well-established and varies according to the needs of each market. Our subsidiaries in certain countries primarily utilize internal warehousing and distribution capabilities that enable direct shipment to key retailers. Our products are stored in our plants and third-party owned warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities. 
 SPD markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the U.S. and Canada. Distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturers’ representatives and independent distributors. Our products in this segment are stored in our plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities.
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
 Approximately 83%, 84% and 83% of our consolidated net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were to customers in the U.S. Approximately 95%, 98% and 96% of our long-lived assets were located in the U.S. at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other than the U.S., no one country accounts for more than 5% of consolidated net sales or 5% of total assets. 
SEASONALITY
 
Our business is generally not seasonal, although the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments are affected by sales of SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes (which typically are higher during the fall, in advance of the holiday season), sales of NAIR depilatories and waxes (which typically are higher in the spring and summer months), and sales of VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS dietary supplements (which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year, in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health).
RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY
 We manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at Green River, Wyoming and Old Fort, Ohio. The primary source of soda ash, a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate, is the mineral trona, which is found in abundance in southwestern Wyoming near our Green River plant. We have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 7


We are a party to a partnership agreement with Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners, which mines and processes trona reserves in Wyoming. Through the partnership and related supply and services agreements, we fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements, enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material. We also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company. The partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us. We believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available.
 We believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of our other major products. Detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources. Bottles, paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers, although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under long-term supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale. We also use a palm oil fraction (by-product) in a number of products including, our rumen bypass fats products. Alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements.
 The cost of raw materials, including surfactants, diesel fuel and oil based raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses, were higher in 2017 relative to 2016, increasing our core commodity costs. Increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers.
 We utilize the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products. 
 PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
 Our trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this Annual Report. The majority of our trademarks are registered with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries. The ARM & HAMMER trademark has been used by us since 1867, and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of our business. Our products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by the Company, including TROJAN, NAIR, ORAJEL, WATERPIK, FIRST RESPONSE, XTRA, OXICLEAN, SPINBRUSH, BATISTE, SIMPLY SALINE, L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION. Our portfolio of trademarks represents substantial goodwill in the businesses using the trademarks.
 U.S. patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. Although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole. 
 CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG 
 In each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, net sales to our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates (“Wal-Mart”), were 24%, 24% and 24% respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the three-year period. The time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short, and as a result, backlog is not significant. 
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
 We conduct research and development activities primarily at our Princeton facility in New Jersey. We devote significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and basic research to develop differentiated products with new and distinctive features and to provide increased convenience and value to our customers. To increase our innovative capabilities, we engage outside contractors for general research and development in activities beyond our core areas of expertise. We spent $70.8 million, $63.2 million and $64.7 million on research and development activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 General
 Some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and foreign agencies. 
 FDA regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products, such as product development, manufacturing, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and distribution. The regulations adopted and standards imposed by the FDA and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in 
 8


compliance. These agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines and penalties, the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing and/or distribution. 
 In addition, we sell products that are subject to regulation under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, both of which are administered by the EPA. 
 We are also subject to regulation by the FTC in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling, advertising, promotion, trade practices and other matters.  The FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. Such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of a dietary supplement.
 The CPSC administers the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products, including pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and dietary substances, containing certain ingredients (e.g., iron).
 Our relationship with certain union employees may be overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the countries, states, provinces and other localities in which we sell our products. 
 Medical Device Clearance and Approval 
 To be commercially distributed in the U.S., a medical device must, unless exempt, receive clearance or approval from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). For lower risk class II devices, we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “510(k)” clearance. Our condoms, lubricants, contact lens solution, wound wash and home pregnancy test kits are regulated as class II devices. Some other low risk devices, including SPINBRUSH and other battery powered toothbrushes, are in class I and are generally exempted from the 510(k) requirement. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device, or “predicate” that is already legally in commercial distribution. Any modification to a 510(k) cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, generally requires a new 510(k) clearance. We may determine that a new 510(k) clearance is not required, but if the FDA disagrees, it may retroactively require a 510(k) clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance is obtained. 
Medical Device Postmarket Regulation
 After a medical device is commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including: 
  
• | the quality system regulation, which imposes FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements governing the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, servicing, labeling, storage, installation, and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use;
• | labeling regulations, including a prohibition on product promotion for unapproved or “off label” uses; 
• | the medical device reporting regulation requiring a manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
• | the reports of corrections and removals regulation, which requires a manufacturer to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. 

 OTC Pharmaceutical
 We market over-the-counter (“OTC”) pharmaceutical products, such as toothpaste, antiperspirant, and oral analgesics products, that are also subject to FDA and foreign regulation. Under the U.S. OTC monograph system, selected OTC pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application. The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels. Pharmaceutical products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements.
 9


All facilities where OTC pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with cGMP regulations and/or regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located. All of our pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility, such as seizure, injunction or recall. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our OTC pharmaceutical products marketed in the U.S.
We cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business.
 Food Products
 We market baking soda and animal feed products, such as rumen fermentation enhancers and Dietary Cation-Anion Difference (“DCAD”) balancers that are also subject to FDA and foreign regulation. The Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls including hazard analysis, risk controls, supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping. FSMA grants the FDA the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain conditions. The FDA is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of FSMA. The potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance cannot be determined now.
Dietary Supplements
 The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, importing, selling, and storing of dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDCA governs the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. 
 Dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the U.S. before October 15, 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing, unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered. The notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. The FDA may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe, which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient. On July 5, 2011, the FDA issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients for public comment and not for implementation. The FDA has not taken any further steps to implement the guidance, which, if implemented, could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients that may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification. 
 A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading, the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action.
 The FDA’s cGMP regulations govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. As with OTC products, the FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility, seizure, injunction or recall. There is considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation and implementation of the cGMP regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated, and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. The manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the U.S. whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the FDA. 
 Additional legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements. The effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, if and 
 10


when promulgated, cannot be determined. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation.  
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns including air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management activities, and the safety of our employees. We endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations. These steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities. The audits, conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental, health and safety compliance, include site visits at each location, as well as, a review of documentary information, to determine compliance with such federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. 
EMPLOYEES 
 At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,700 employees. We are party to a labor contract with the International Machinists Union at our Colonial Heights, Virginia plant, which expires May 31, 2018. Internationally, we employ union employees in France, Mexico, Brazil and New Zealand. We believe our relations with both our union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
