Company Overview
 
We are an end-to-end, full-service programmatic advertising platform primarily focused on providing advertising technology, data-driven campaign optimization and other solutions to underserved and less efficient markets on both the buy- and sell-side of the digital advertising ecosystem. Direct Digital Holdings, Inc., incorporated as a Delaware corporation on August 23, 2021, is the holding company for DDH LLC, the business formed by our founders in 2018 through the acquisitions of Huddled Masses and Colossus Media. Colossus Media operates our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™. Huddled Masses is the platform for the buy-side of our business. In 2020 we acquired Orange142 to further bolster our overall programmatic buy-side advertising platform and enhance our offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, healthcare, education, financial services and consumer products with particular emphasis on small and mid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets. In February 2022, we completed our initial public offering and certain organizational transactions which resulted in our current structure.
 
In the digital advertising space, buyers, particularly small and mid-sized businesses, can potentially achieve significantly higher return on investment (“ROI”) on their advertising spend compared to traditional media advertising by leveraging data-driven over-the-top/connected TV (“OTT/CTV”), video and display, in-app, native and audio advertisements that are delivered both at scale and on a highly targeted basis. Traditional (non-digital) advertising, such as broadcast TV or print media, follows the “spray and pray” approach to reach out to the public, but the ROI from using such traditional (non-digital) advertising campaigns is mostly unpredictable. On the other hand, digital advertising is heavily data-driven and can provide real-time details of targeted advertising campaigns and outcomes. On the sell-side, publishers can more successfully sell their advertising inventory in a programmatic manner by sharing data and information about their digital audiences at scale on an individualized basis, which helps buyers to better target audiences.
 


Programmatic Marketplace Transaction
 
The Buy Side
 
On the buy side of the digital supply chain, digital advertising is the practice of delivering promotional content to users through various online and digital channels and leverages multiple channels, platforms such as social media, email, search engines, mobile applications and websites to display advertisements and messages to audiences. Traditional (non-digital) advertising follows the “spray and pray” approach to reach out to the public, but the ROI is mostly unpredictable. On the other hand, digital advertising is heavily data-driven and can give real-time details of advertising campaigns and outcomes. The availability of user data and rich targeting capabilities makes digital advertising an effective and important tool for businesses to connect with their audiences.
 
We have aligned our business strategy to capitalize on significant growth opportunities due to fundamental market shifts and industry inefficiencies. Several trends, happening in parallel, are revolutionizing the way that advertising is bought and sold. Specifically, the rise of the internet has led to a wholesale change in the way that media is consumed and monetized, as ads can be digitally delivered on a 1-to-1 basis. In traditional methods of advertising, such as broadcast TV, ads can target a specific network, program, or geography, but not a single household or individual as digital and OTT/CTV ads can. Additionally, we expect that the continued destabilization, including the phase out of digital “cookies” in 2023, will (i) create more opportunities for technology companies that provide next-generation CTV and digital solutions and (ii) minimize performance disruption for advertisers and agencies.

The Buy-Side Business: Huddled Masses & Orange142
 
The buy-side segment of our business, operated through Huddled Masses, which has been in operation since 2012, and Orange142, which has been in operation since 2013, enables us to provide the programmatic purchase of advertising on behalf of our clients. Programmatic advertising is rapidly taking market share from traditional ad sales channels, which require more staffing, offer less transparency and involve higher costs to buyers. Our buy-side platform provides the technology for first-party data management, media purchases, campaign execution and analytics, and therefore helps drive increased ROI across a wide array of digital media channels. Because our technology accesses several of the large demand side platforms (“DSPs”), our platform is able to leverage customer insights across multiple DSPs to drive campaign performance and ROI for our clients. By taking this DSP-agnostic approach, our platform provides the broadest market access for our clients so that clients can easily buy ads on desktop, mobile, connected TV, linear TV, streaming audio and digital billboards. Additionally, our technology has unique visibility across inventory to create customized audience segments at scale. Depending on the client objective and DSP we choose, our buy-side platform provides forecasting and deep market insights to our clients to improve their return-on-advertising spend (“ROAS”) across channels.
 
The buy-side segment businesses offer technology-enabled advertising solutions and strategic planning to clients. In particular, our buy-side platform focuses on small to-mid-sized clients and enable them to leverage programmatic technology to engage their potential customers more directly, on a one-on-one basis, in any local market, with specificity to media device and footprint. Our technology leverages data to assess where our clients’ potential customers are in the decision-making process and manage campaign pacing and optimization based on data-driven analytics to drive the purchasing decision or encourage the call to action. With marketing budgets typically more limited and operating footprints generally more local or state-to-state, we believe small and mid-sized businesses are focused primarily on ROI-based results that deliver precise advertising and measurable campaign success to level the playing field with larger competitors. Serving the needs of approximately 200 small and mid-sized clients for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the buy-side of our business leverages the insights of leading DSPs, such as The Trade Desk, Xandr, Google DV360, MediaMath and others, to drive increased advertising ROI and reduced customer acquisition costs for our clients. The result is the benefit to our buy-side clients in that they enjoy a more even playing field compared to larger advertisers by driving more effective marketing and advertising in local markets that are compatible to their business footprint.
 
We believe that we have a unique competitive advantage due to our data-driven technology that allows us to provide front-end, buy-side planning for our small and mid-sized clients, coupled with our proprietary Colossus SSP where we can curate the last-mile in the execution process to drive higher ROI. In our business and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use the terms client and customer interchangeably.
 
The Sell Side
 
On the sell side of the digital supply chain, the supply side platform (“SSP”), is an ad technology platform used by publishers to sell, manage and optimize the ad inventory on their websites in an automated and effective way. The SSPs help the publishers monetize the display ads, video ads, and native ads on their websites and mobile apps. The SSPs have enhanced their functionalities over the years and have included ad exchange mechanisms to efficiently manage their ad inventory. Also, SSPs allow the publishers to connect to DSPs directly instead of connecting through ad exchanges. The SSP allows publishers’ inventory to be opened up and made available to advertisers they may not be able to directly connect with. SSPs sell ad inventories in many ways — for example, directly to ad networks, via direct deals with DSPs, and most commonly via real-time bidding (“RTB”) auctions. The publisher makes its ad inventory available on an SSP and invites advertisers to bid based on the user’s data received. Each time the publisher’s web page loads, an ad request is sent to multiple ad exchanges and, in some cases, to the demand side platform directly from the SSP. In the case of RTB media buys, many DSPs would place bids to the impressions being offered by the publisher during the auction. The advertiser that bids a higher amount compared to other advertisers will win the bid and pay the second highest price for the winning impression to serve the ads.

The Sell-Side Platform: Colossus SSP
 
Colossus Media, which has been in operation since 2017, is our proprietary sell-side programmatic platform operating under the trademarked banner of Colossus SSP™. Our sell-side segment maintains a proprietary platform, Colossus SSP, which is an advertising technology platform used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize available inventory (ad space) on their websites and mobile apps in an automated way. In December 2021, our platform processed over 70 billion impressions, over 200 billion auction bid requests that seek to buy ad inventory from our publishers and served approximately 80,000 buyers. Each impression or transaction occurs in a fraction of a second. Given that most transactions take place in an auction/bidding format, we continue to make investment across the platform to further reduce the processing time. In addition to the robust infrastructure supporting our platform, it is also critical that we align with key industry partners in the digital supply chain.
 
Colossus SSP is agnostic to any specific demand side platform. To that end, our proprietary Colossus SSP is integrated into several leading DSPs both directly, through Bidswitch, and indirectly, through such platforms as Xandr/AppNexus, The Trade Desk, Google 360, Verizon Media, MediaMath, Zeta Global, Samsung, Pulsepoint, and others. We continue to add new DSP partners especially where we believe the DSP might offer a unique advertising base seeking to target our multicultural audiences at scale. We help our advertiser clients efficiently reach diverse communities including African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and LGBTQ+ customers in highly targeted campaigns. This business began as a trading desk supporting advertisers’ desires to reach diverse audiences and has evolved into the preeminent ad tech platform to support this goal. We partner with both large publishers such as Hearst, MediaVine, Gannett, and several others, as well as smaller publishers such as Ebony Magazine, People Magazine, Newsweek, Blavity, La Nacion and many others.
 
Colossus SSP offers our publisher clients’ ad inventory to existing small and mid-sized buy-side clients at Huddled Masses and Orange142, and other major DSP clients of Colossus Media, which enables our buy-side technology to curate and manage client outcomes more effectively. In addition, because it is a stand-alone platform, Colossus SSP offers its ad inventory to larger, multinational, clients seeking more authentic advertising access to unique, often diverse and multicultural, audiences.
 
Our proprietary Colossus SSP was custom developed with a view towards the specific challenges facing small and mid-sized publishers with the belief that often smaller publishers offer a more engaged, highly-valued, unique following but experienced technological and budgetary constraints on the path to monetization. Connecting our buy-side business to Colossus SSP completes the end-to-end solution for our small to-mid-sized buy-side customers while creating additional revenue opportunities for our Colossus SSP publishers.
 
Our business strategy on the sell-side also presents significant growth potential, as we believe we are well positioned to be able to bring underserved multicultural publishers into the advertising ecosystem, thereby increasing our value proposition across all clients including our large clients. We have proprietary rights to the Colossus SSP via a license agreement with a third-party developer. We believe the Colossus SSP is the last-mile of delivery for our buy-side clients in that our technology curates unique, highly optimized audiences informed by data analytics, artificial intelligence and algorithmic machine-learning technology, resulting in increased campaign performance.
 
The Data Management Platform
 
We also leverage a sophisticated data management platform, which is DDH’s proprietary data collection and data marketing platform used to gather first-party data, market intelligence and audience segmentation information to support campaign optimization efforts for buy-side clients, Colossus SSP clients and third-party clients. Our combined platform offers results in an enhanced, highly loyal client base, particularly on the buy-side.
Our Industry and Trends
 
There are several key industry trends that are revolutionizing the way that advertising is bought and sold. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the rapidly evolving industry trends in digital marketing and shifts in consumer behavior, including:
Shift to Digital Advertising. Media has increasingly become more digital as a result of three key items:
 

• | Advances in technology with more sophisticated digital content delivery across multiple platforms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in consumer behavior, including spending longer portions of the day using mobile and other devices; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Better audience segmentation with more efficient targeting and measurable results.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The resulting shift has enabled a variety of options for advertisers to efficiently target and measure their advertising campaigns across nearly every media channel and device. These efforts have been led by big-budgeted, large, multi-national corporations incentivized to cast a broad advertising net to support national brands.

Shift from Linear Broadcast to OTT/CTV. According to eMarketer, as of the end of 2022, approximately 68.5 million U.S. households will maintain a cable subscription which declined from approximately 78 million U.S. households at the end of 2020. However, advertising reach could access more than 240.7 million households via OTT subscriptions, or at least 70 million households via ad-supported OTT/CTV channels, according to ComScore’s “State of OTT 2021” report. Consumers increasingly want the flexibility and freedom to consume content on their own terms resulting in access to premium content at lower prices and with fewer interruptions. Advertisers are recognizing these trends and reallocating their ad budgets accordingly to those companies that can access audiences through a variety of existing and new channels.
 
Increased Adoption of Digital Advertising by Small and Mid-Sized Companies. Only recently small and mid-sized businesses have begun to leverage the power of digital media in meaningful ways, as emerging technologies have enabled advertising across multiple channels in a highly localized nature. Campaign efficiencies yielding measurable results and higher advertising ROI, as well as the needs necessitated by the global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic, have prompted these companies to begin utilizing digital advertising on an accelerated pace. We believe this market is rapidly expanding, and that small to-mid-sized advertisers will continue to increase their digital spend.
 
Significant Increase in Multicultural Audience and Targeted Content. As digital media has grown and emerging marketing channels continue to gain adoption, audience segmentation, including on multicultural lines, has become more granular. A growing and increasing segment of those audiences is the multicultural audience, which has been traditionally underserved in the industry. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, racial minority and multi-racial consumers represent 42% of the U.S. population and are projected to be the numerical majority in the U.S. by 2044. When we expand the definition of multicultural to include LGBTQ+ customers, the numbers are significantly greater. Advertisers and publishers alike face the same challenge. Advertisers are seeking new avenues and opportunities to connect with multicultural audiences in their natural media consumption environments while publishers are producing unique content to attract loyal consumers. The advantage will go to those innovative companies able to directly connect both sides to those audiences and leverage the insights flowing from those connections.
Local Ad Buying Becoming More Programmatic. Programmatic advertising enables advertisers to precisely target local audiences and increasingly an “audience of one.” Large amounts of inventory have been consolidated, allowing local advertisers to then be more selective about where, when and to whom they show their ads. The technology behind programmatic advertising, such as geotargeting, IP address identification, 1-3-5 radius store location advertising, has provided the opportunity for targeted local advertising to smaller advertisers, which technologies in the past have been more easily available to larger national advertisers. We believe being able to go into a programmatic platform and target the same audience across all digital inventory is a major competitive advantage. Additionally, we also believe that the ability to customize audiences to the needs of local providers is a significant benefit for local advertisers since they are able to deviate from the broad audience segments defined by national advertisers. Higher customer engagement translates into higher retention and extended customer lifecycle representing the opportunity to sell and upsell customers. We believe the local advertising market remains in the early stages of understanding and leveraging these capabilities.
Death of Cookies Will Likely Destabilize Small-to-Mid-Size Business Ad Market. As the advertising industry faces the eventual phasing out of third-party cookies, namely by Google, by 2023, small-to-mid-sized business will face potentially greater challenges in the adoption and transition to digital. While first- party data driven by first-party cookies will still have broad-based advertising support, more robust advertising efforts are expected to experience some level of performance degradation. Specifically, the inability to tie ad impressions to an identity will add to the list of challenges already being faced by small-to-mid-sized businesses. We expect that the destabilization will create significant opportunities for next-generation technology companies that can provide media buying solutions and minimize performance disruption for advertisers and agencies.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has put a greater focus on ROI on ad spend performance. Compared to traditional channels, digital ads are more measurable and flexible, which makes them more attractive and resilient.
 
Our Customers
 
On the buy-side of our business, our customers consist primarily of purchasers of digital advertising inventory and consulting services. We served the needs of approximately 200 small and mid-sized clients during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, consisting of advertising buyers, including small and mid-sized companies, large advertising holding companies (which may manage several agencies), independent advertising agencies and mid-market advertising service organizations. Many advertising agencies and advertising holding companies have decision-making that is generally highly decentralized, such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. We serve a variety of customers across multiple industries including travel/tourism (including destination marketing organizations or DMOs), energy, consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) healthcare, education, financial services (including cryptocurrency technologies) and other industries. Some of the significant brands we work with on the buy-side include the U.S. Army, Just Energy, Bitcoin Depot, Visit Virginia Beach, Visit Colorado Springs and Pigeon Forge.

On the sell-side of our business, the Colossus SSP, the buyers on our platform include DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 15,400 advertisers per month in 2020, which has increased to approximately 80,000 in December 2021. As spending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of the overall ad spend, advertisers and agencies are seeking greater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into Supply Path Optimization (“SPO”) agreements directly with buyers. As part of these agreements, we are providing advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, volume-based business terms, and visibility into campaign performance data and methodology. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe the following attributes and capabilities form our core strengths and provide us with competitive advantages:
 

• | End-to-End, Technology-Driven Solution Focused on Providing Higher Value to Underserved Markets. Our small and mid-sized client base is seeking high ROI, low customer acquisition costs and measurable results that grow their topline. Because we focus exclusively on the first and last miles of media delivery, we engage clients at the front-end of the digital supply chain with the first dollar of spend, in many cases prior to agency involvement, and drive data-driven results across the digital advertising ecosystem to optimize ROI. We offer an end-to-end solution that enables us to set and carry- out the digital campaign strategy of our clients in full, in a more efficient and less expensive manner than some of our competitors. Small and mid-sized companies are looking for partners that can drive results across the entire digital supply chain. On the Colossus SSP, we offer a wide range of niche and general market publishers an opportunity to maximize advertising revenue driven by technology-enabled targeted advertising to multicultural and other audiences. We believe our technology’s ability to tailor our efforts to our clients-specific needs and inform those efforts with data and algorithmic learnings is a long-term advantage to serving this end of the market.

• | Comprehensive Processes Enhance Ad Inventory Quality and Reduce Invalid Traffic (“IVT”). We operate what we believe to be one of the most comprehensive processes in the digital advertising ecosystem to enhance ad inventory quality. In January 2022, Colossus SSP was ranked by MediaMath as 5th among the industry’s approximately 80 supply-side companies in terms of key quality measures such as transparency, fraud detection, and accountability. In the advertising industry, inventory quality is assessed in terms of IVT, which can be impacted by fraud such as “fake eyeballs” generated by automated technologies set up to artificially inflate impression counts. As a result of our platform design and proactive IVT mitigation efforts, in 2021, less than 1% of inventory was determined to be invalid, resulting in minimal financial impact to our customers. We address IVT on a number of fronts, including: sophisticated technology, which detects and avoids invalid traffic on the front end; direct publisher and inventory relationships, for supply path optimization; and ongoing campaign and inventory performance review, to ensure inventory quality and brand protection controls are in place.

• | Curated Data-Driven Sell-Side Platform to Support Buy-Side. The Colossus SSP enables us to gather data to build and develop unique product offerings for our clients. The ability to curate our supply allows us to serve a broad range of clients with challenging and unique advertising needs and optimize campaign performance in a way that our siloed competitors are unable to do. This model, together with our infrastructure solutions and ability to quickly access excess server capacity, helps us scale up efficiently and allows us to grow our business at a faster pace than a pure buy-side solution would. In addition, our clients can easily buy targeted data from over 150 sources through our platform. We also provide clients access to our proprietary data through our data management platform, which only increases with continued use of our platform. We believe that the integration of data and decisioning within a single platform enables us to better serve our clients.

• | High Client Retention Rate and Cross Selling Opportunities. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we had approximately 200 clients on the buy-side and 80,000 clients on the sell-side. They understand the independent nature of our platform and relentless focus on driving ROI-based results. Our value proposition is complete alignment across our entire digital supply platform beginning with the first dollar in and last dollar out. We are technology and media agnostic, and our clients trust us to provide the best opportunity for success of their brands and businesses. As a result, our clients have been loyal, with over 90% client retention for the clients that represent approximately 80% of our revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In addition, we cultivate client relationships through our pipeline of moderate and self-serve clients that conduct campaigns within our platform that eventually grow into managed service clients, which has resulted in their increased use of our platform over time. As our clients expand their usage of our technology platform, they often transition to our managed services delivery model, which in turn drives increased client loyalty. The managed services delivery model allows us to combine our technology with a highly personalized offering to strategically design and manage advertising campaigns, provide ad hoc support and recommend strategy adjustments as needed.

• | Growing and Profitable Business Model. We have grown our revenue steadily while increasing our gross profit, which we believe demonstrates the power of our technology platform, the strength of our client relationships and the leverage inherent to our business model. On September 30, 2020, we acquired Orange142 to further bolster our overall buy-side advertising platform and enhance our offerings across multiple industry verticals such as travel, healthcare, education, financial services, consumer products and others, with particular emphasis on small and mid-sized businesses transitioning into digital with growing digital media budgets. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net loss was $(1.5) million and $(0.9) million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $6.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Please see the section of this Annual Report titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

• | Solutions for the Destabilization of Advertising. As a result of the impending phase out of third-party cookies by 2023 by Google, we have begun integrating identity resolution solutions in order to provide our clients with accurate, targeted advertising without cookies. We believe these solutions provide higher CPM (cost per thousand impressions) advertising, thus resulting in higher revenues. Leveraging our third-party technology providers, our technology has a potential reach of over 250 million matched people online and is powered by over 600 million unique online authentication events per month. To cater to the need for precision and scale, we will be investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to build out our own collection of identities, often referred to as an “ID Lake,” from first-party and third-party data sources, that will facilitate matches and relations between the disparate sets of data.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced Management Team. Our management team, led by our two founders, has significant experience in the digital advertising industry and with identifying and integrating acquired businesses. Specifically, our two founders, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Walker and President Keith Smith, have over 45 years of combined experience. The team has led digital marketing efforts for companies both large and small, with unique experience leading small and mid-sized companies through the challenges of transitioning platforms into the programmatic advertising space. Our Chief Technology Officer, Anu Pillai, is experienced in developing digital platforms on both the buy-side and sell-side, ranging from consumer-packaged goods (“CPG”) companies focused on e-commerce to publishers seeking to monetize their ad inventory. Our Chief Financial Officer, Susan Echard, a former senior auditor at Ernst & Young LLP, has significant experience working with public companies directly as well a strong background with mergers and acquisitions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ESG-Centered Strategy. We believe our business strategy promotes the ideals of a business focused on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues, with particular focus on social and governance issues. Our unique focus has already resulted in numerous partnerships with both large and small advertisers as the multicultural market continues to grow and expand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Social, Diversity and Governance
 
We believe it is essential for our organization, from top to bottom, to understand and relate to the issues our clients face on both the buy-side and sell-side. Our founding owners are of African-American descent and founded our Company on multicultural principles designed to alleviate the challenges that buyers and publishers face accessing an expansive multicultural market. Our management team reflects the tone and tenor of our multicultural audiences and our policies on gender equality and gender pay. More than 70% of our management are women and/or identify as being from a diverse background, including all four of our executive officers.

 Environmental
 
Our platform requires significant amounts of information to be stored across multiple servers and we anticipate those amounts to increase significantly as we grow. We are committed to ensuring that we incorporate environmental excellence in our business mindset. Energy use, recycling practices and resource conservation are a few of the factors we take into consideration in building our technological infrastructure, selecting IT partners, and utilizing key suppliers. In the first half of 2022, we expect to transition our server platform to HPE Greenlake, which is centered on environmentally-friendly operations and marketed as “Greenlake-as-a-service,” through which we promote its energy conservation principles. We opted for HPE GreenLake’s as-a-service model because it represents a shift towards supplier responsibility for the elimination of wasted infrastructure and processing capacity. Our needs are metered and monitored, providing insights that can lead to significant resource and energy efficiencies by avoiding overprovisioning and optimizing the IT refresh cycle. This enables us to bring existing equipment to the highest levels of utilization and to eliminate idling equipment that drains energy and resources, yielding both environmental and financial savings.
Our Growth Strategy
 
We have a multi-pronged growth strategy designed to continue to build upon the momentum we have generated so far in order to create opportunities. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:

• | Continue to expand our highly productive “on the ground” buy-side and sell-side sales teams throughout the United States, with a particular focus on markets where we believe our client base is underserved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize management’s experience to identify and close additional acquisition opportunities to accelerate expansion into new industry verticals, grow market share and enhance platform innovation capabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leveraging our end-to-end product offering as a differentiating factor to win new business and cross- sell to existing clients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aggressively grow the Colossus SSP advertising inventory, including both multicultural and general inventory. We aim to increase our omni-channel capabilities to focus on highest growth content formats such as OTT/CTV audio (such as podcasts, etc.), in-app and others.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continued innovation and development of our data management platform and proprietary ID Lake and collection of first-party data to inform decision-making and optimize client campaigns.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in further optimization of our infrastructure and technology solutions to maximize revenue and operating efficiencies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revenues
 
We generate revenues through a broad range of offerings throughout our technology platforms. On the buy-side of our business, our technology drives the design and execution of advertising strategies across an array of digital channels including programmatic display, social, paid search, mobile, native, email, video advertising, OTT/CTV, audio, digital out-of-home (“DOOH”) and more. In the world’s constantly shifting and expanding digital landscape, where it is easy for “set it and leave it” mentalities and impersonal algorithms to steer digital advertising campaigns, our data-driven technologies enable customized ROI-focused outcomes for our clients. Our team is made up of savvy digital strategists, skilled software developers, experienced ad buyers or traders, expert technicians and data analysts. We have a wide variety of small and mid-sized companies representing numerous industry verticals such as travel, healthcare, education, financial services, and consumer goods and services. We are typically engaged on an “insertion order” or master services agreement, with the typical engagement driven by the campaign goals of the client. For our mid- sized clients, we typically engage on a long-term contractual basis ranging from one to five years, while our smaller clients tend to engage on a shorter duration of less than one year despite the fact that many of our smaller clients have been long term clients well in excess of one year.
 
On the sell-side of our business, through our proprietary Colossus SSP, we generate revenues by enabling programmatic media buyers to buy ad inventory from our host of publishers and content creators aggregated to provide access to buyers at scale. Advertisers and agencies often have a large portfolio of brands requiring a variety of campaign types and support for a wide array of inventory formats and devices, including OTT/CTV, video and display, in-app, native and audio. Our omni-channel proprietary technology platform is designed to maximize these various advertising channels, which we believe is a further driver of efficiency for our buyers. As of December 31, 2021, the platform is comprised of publishers across multiple channels including OTT/CTV, display, native, in-app, online video (“OLV”), audio and DOOH. Through our platform, media buyers are able to buy more than 70 billion monthly impressions across many unique audiences including multicultural audiences at scale with 10 billion, or 14%, of those impressions being diverse and multicultural- focused, including African Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans and LGBTQ+ customers. We charge a standard fee to our publishers for providing access to a host of media buyers on a daily basis. Our publishers, through our platform, had access to more than 80,000 buyers of ad inventory in December 2021. We have a sales team working on behalf of our publishers to enlist more ad buyers across all media channels to generate more revenue for our publishers. The Colossus SSP continues to expand its capabilities to give our content providers more avenues to distribute ad inventory such as OTT/CTV, digital audio, DOOH, etc. and inform our publishers to enhance their ad selling needs by distributing content in various forms to meet the rising demands of the ad buying community.

Our sales organization focuses on marketing our technology solution to increase the adoption of our products by existing and new buyers and sellers. We market our products and services to buyers and sellers through our national sales team that operates from various locations across the United States. This team leverages market knowledge and expertise to demonstrate the benefits of programmatic advertising and how we can drive better performance and results for our clients. We are focused on expanding our national sales presence primarily by growing our sales personnel presence in certain states and regions around the country in which we currently operate and/or are seeking to establish a presence. We typically seek to add experienced sales personnel with an established track record and/or verifiable book of business and client relationships.
 
For the buy-side platform, our sales team has three fundamental components: (1) a consulting services team that advises clients on a more enterprise level in the design and implementation of a digital media strategy; (2) a professional services team with each seller integration to assist sellers in getting the most value from our solution; and (3) our client services team that works closely with clients to manage and/or support campaigns. For Colossus SSP, our professional services team manages each new DSP or publisher/seller integration while the buyer team focuses on the unique challenges and issues arising with our inventory buys.
 
Our marketing initiatives are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and driving advertising spend to our platform. We often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, writes whitepapers, publishes marketing collateral, generates blog posts and undertakes client research studies.
 
Competition
 
Buy-Side Competition
 
The buy-side digital advertising industry is a very competitive, fast-paced industry with ongoing technological changes, new market entrants and behavioral changes in content consumption. Overall digital advertising spending historically has been highly concentrated in a small number of very large companies that have their own inventory, including Google, Facebook, Comcast, Verizon, AT&T and Amazon, with which we compete for digital advertising inventory and demand. Despite the dominance of large companies, there is still a large addressable market that is highly fragmented and includes many providers of transaction services with which we compete. There has been rapid evolution and consolidation in the advertising technology industry, and we expect these trends to continue, thereby increasing the capabilities and competitive posture of larger companies, particularly those that are already dominant in various ways, and enabling new or stronger competitors to emerge. Based on the current focus of our competitors, there is even more opportunity for engagement in the underserved and multicultural markets on which we focus.
 
Sell-Side Competition
 
On the sell-side of the digital advertising industry, competition is robust but more limited in that there were approximately 80 current SSPs in operation as of January 2022, according to MediaMath. We continue to refine our offering so that it remains competitive in scope, ease of use, scalability, speed, data access, price, inventory quality, brand security, customer service, identity protection and other technological features that help sellers monetize their inventory and buyers increase the return on their advertising investment. While our industry is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that our solution enables us to compete favorably on these factors. We achieve this by ensuring that we have the right integrations and implementations in place. Our traffic verification partner is directly integrated within our exchange to ensure inventory quality on a real-time basis. We partner with an accredited Media Rating Council vendor to provide an added layer of security through sophisticated IVT detection and filtration. Our verification with the Trustworthy Accountability Group indicates our status as a trusted player in the digital advertising ecosystem. Through our direct integration with The Media Trust’s Creative Quality Assurance (QA) product, we detect and eliminate the serving of malicious ads in real time, and by transacting on a universal cookie ID, consumers are served more relevant ads, advertisers reach more valuable users and publishers can match their audience data. In the end, we believe these factors enable our sales team to promote the advantages of our platform and drive greater adoption of Colossus SSP.

Seasonality in Our Business
 
In the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in our sell-side advertising segment, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, for our buy-side advertising segment, the second and third quarters of the year reflect our highest levels of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 57 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our employees are good. We promote a diverse workforce and believe that it fosters innovation and cultivates an environment filled with unique perspectives. As a result, diversity and inclusion are part and parcel of our ability to meet the needs of our customers. Respect for human rights and a commitment to ethical business conduct are fundamental to our business model. In addition, we measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis, as we believe an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive and profitable company. We obtain feedback from our employees to implement programs and processes designed to keep our employees connected with the Company.
Intellectual Property
 
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws in the U.S. and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property.
 
We own intellectual property related to our owned sites. As of December 31, 2021, we owned approximately four websites and URLs in varying stages of development to support our marketers advertising efforts. We also hold six U.S. registered trademarks and one pending trademark registration application.
