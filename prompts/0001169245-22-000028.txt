Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Our lead product candidate, bentracimab (also known as PB2452), is a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. Based on feedback from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to seek approval of bentracimab in the United States through an accelerated approval process. Bentracimab has been generally well tolerated in our completed trials, with no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs. In our completed Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials of bentracimab, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours. We are currently conducting our pivotal Phase 3 REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab. In a prespecified interim analysis of 150 enrolled patients (142 of whom enrolled required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure and eight of whom enrolled with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding), bentracimab achieved the primary endpoint of the trial by immediately and sustainably reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. We are targeting to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although this timing could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are developing bentracimab pursuant to a co-development agreement, or the SFJ Agreement, with SFJ Pharmaceuticals X, Ltd., an SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group company, or SFJ. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. We are also developing our preclinical product candidate, PB6440, for treatment-resistant hypertension. Except for the rights that we granted to Alfasigma S.p.A., or Alfasigma, for bentracimab, we retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates.
As we advance our clinical programs for bentracimab with site activations and patient enrollment, we remain in close contact with our clinical research organizations, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 and its variants may have on our clinical trials and current timelines and to consider whether we can implement appropriate mitigating measures to help lessen such impacts. At this time, however, we cannot fully forecast the scope of impacts that COVID-19 may have on our ability to initiate trial sites, enroll and assess patients, supply study drug and report trial results. 
Bentracimab
Bentracimab is a novel recombinant human monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment, or Fab fragment, designed to reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor is an antiplatelet therapy widely prescribed to reduce the rates of death, heart attack and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome, or ACS, or who have previously experienced a heart attack. The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines recognize ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet therapy for ACS. In 2021, ticagrelor, currently marketed by AstraZeneca plc, or AstraZeneca, under the brand names Brilinta and Brilique, had worldwide sales of $1.5 billion. Ticagrelor binds to platelets to prevent them from forming blood clots, which could restrict blood flow to critical organs in these patients, causing heart attacks or strokes. Due to ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, patients on ticagrelor have an elevated risk of spontaneous bleeding. In addition, patients on ticagrelor who need urgent surgery cannot wait the recommended five days for ticagrelor’s effect to dissipate and are at increased risk of major bleeding during and after surgery. There are currently no other known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs. In the European Union, an extracorporeal whole blood purification adsorber device is available that may be useful for non-specific removal of ticagrelor during some cardiac procedures when used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass. The maker of the device, CytoSorbents Corporation, has also initiated a clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the use of the DrugSorb-ATR antithrombotic removal system during cardiothoracic surgery. Upon approval, bentracimab would be the only therapeutic agent available for specific reversal of ticagrelor. We believe the availability of bentracimab as a specific reversal agent could expand ticagrelor's use by mitigating concerns regarding bleeding risk and uniquely position ticagrelor as the only oral antiplatelet drug with a reversal agent. In our Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials, as well as in the interim analysis of our Phase 3 REVERSE-IT trial, bentracimab achieved immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity, with potential customizable duration of reversal based on the dosing regimen, which we believe has the potential to bring life-saving therapeutic benefit to these patients by increasing the safety of ticagrelor.
In March 2020, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial, a global, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial in which we plan to enroll a total of 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. The primary endpoints for this trial are the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with intravenous infusion of bentracimab as measured by the VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker and achievement of clinical hemostasis in enrolled patients. In the interim analysis of 150 enrolled patients (142 of whom required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure and eight of whom enrolled with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding), which we announced 
in November 2021, bentracimab achieved the primary endpoint of the trial by immediately and sustainably reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. Bentracimab was generally well tolerated, with five drug-related non-serious adverse events reported in three patients. The cohort of patients requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure has been fully enrolled, and trial sites have shifted focus to enrolling patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding events. We are continuing to attempt to accelerate enrollment of these patients, including by working to increase the number of enrolling clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, and the European Union as we believe that a broader site footprint will increase the probability of enrolling these patients. In addition, our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for bentracimab was recently approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, of the China National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, in August 2021. We expect to begin enrolling patients in China in the first half of 2022.
The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab in April 2019, and the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, granted bentracimab Priority Medicines, or PRIME, designation in February 2020. The FDA previously provided feedback that we could submit a BLA for potential accelerated approval based on an interim analysis of the first approximately 100 patients treated in our REVERSE-IT trial. For the interim analysis, the FDA also recommended that approximately 50 patients enrolled have uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and approximately 50 require urgent surgery or an invasive procedure, although the FDA indicated that whether there are an adequate number of patients in either group would be a review issue.
We intend to submit our BLA for potential accelerated approval based on the interim analysis of the patients in our REVERSE-IT trial, all of whom were measured against the same VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker and hemostasis endpoints described above. For the interim analysis, we elected to continue to enroll ticagrelor patients in excess of our prior target of approximately 100 patients to take advantage of robust surgical enrollment and to mitigate continued uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on future patient availability. We are targeting to submit our BLA in mid-2022, although that timeline could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the submission of our BLA, the FDA could determine that we did not enroll a sufficient number of patients in the REVERSE-IT trial, including patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding, for all or some of the proposed indications we intend to pursue. Further, the FDA may require us to conduct extensive post-approval studies or require us to make modifications to our ongoing REVERSE-IT trial after approval and marketing.
We intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA
requirements. With regard to the 200 total patients needed for full enrollment of the REVERSE-IT trial, our protocol provides
that no more than approximately two-thirds of patients can come from either the uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding
population or the patient population requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. The Committee for Medicinal Products
for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA has also generally agreed with our proposed clinical development plan for bentracimab.
In June 2021, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Alfasigma, or the Alfasigma Sublicense, pursuant to which we granted Alfasigma exclusive rights to distribute and sell bentracimab in the European Union and European Economic Area, as well as the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine and certain other countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States, Europe and central Asia, or the Sublicense Territory. Under the Alfasigma Sublicense, we are responsible for developing bentracimab and securing regulatory approval with the EMA and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, including in accordance with the SFJ Agreement, after which any marketing authorizations will be assigned to Alfasigma. Alfasigma is obligated to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals necessary to market and sell bentracimab (including pricing approvals and post-marketing commitments) and is also responsible for securing regulatory approval in countries outside of Europe and the United Kingdom.
PB6440
PB6440 is a highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor being developed for treatment-resistant hypertension. In preclinical studies to date, PB6440 demonstrated dose-dependent aldosterone reduction without a significant increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone or deoxycortisol in both rodent and primate models. The oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles observed in these preclinical studies appear suitable for once-daily oral dosing in humans. To date, no evidence of toxicity has been observed in either in vitro toxicity studies or in animal models, including primates. We initiated nonclinical IND-enabling studies for PB6440 in 2021 and we plan to submit an IND in the second half of 2022. We are also targeting to begin a first-in-human trial in late 2022, although our timelines could be impacted by the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, develop and commercialize novel therapies for cardiovascular diseases. The key elements of our strategy include:
•Continue to advance bentracimab through clinical development and regulatory approval. We intend to develop and commercialize bentracimab as a novel reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. In 
March 2020, in collaboration with SFJ, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial in patients on ticagrelor with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure, and recently completed the planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial. We intend to continue to enroll patients in the REVERSE-IT trial in the United States, the European Union and Canada, and we expect to begin enrolling patients in China in the first half of 2022. We have received Breakthrough Therapy designation and plan to submit a BLA seeking accelerated approval of bentracimab prior to completion of the REVERSE-IT trial, based on biomarker data from an initial subset of the REVERSE-IT patients, in mid-2022. The EMA granted bentracimab PRIME designation in February 2020, and the China NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in December 2021.
•Continue the preclinical development of PB6440 for treatment-resistant hypertension. We initiated IND-enabling studies for PB6440 in 2021, and we plan to submit an IND for PB6440 with the FDA in the second half of 2022. We are also targeting to begin a first-in-human trial in late 2022, although our timelines could be impacted by the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
•Leverage our ELP technology platform to expand our development pipeline. We believe that our ELP technology enhances solubility, stability and bioavailability, provides extended drug exposure and creates product candidates that are straightforward to manufacture and administer. As such, we plan to utilize our platform to identify product candidates for additional indications. We intend to apply our ELP technology to improve the pharmacokinetics of proteins and peptides with well-characterized therapeutic activities but suboptimal half-lives, in order to improve their pharmacokinetics, enable their use as pharmaceutical products and allow for more convenient dosing regimens.
•Commercialize our product candidates. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with AstraZeneca for bentracimab and Duke University, or Duke, for our ELP technology, pursuant to which we retain worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates. In addition, we own all of the assets and intellectual property rights related to PB6440. If approved, we intend to commercialize bentracimab and PB6440 independently in the United States and through partnerships in international markets. As we advance towards regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we intend to establish a focused marketing and sales infrastructure.
Pipeline
Our preclinical and clinical-stage pipeline is set forth below:
Bentracimab: Antiplatelet Therapy Reversal Agent for Ticagrelor
Our lead product candidate, bentracimab, is a novel ticagrelor reversal agent, which we are developing for the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor.
We are currently conducting REVERSE-IT, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of bentracimab, in which we plan to enroll 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. In the interim analysis of 150 enrolled patients, bentracimab achieved the primary endpoint of the trial by immediately and sustainably reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. Bentracimab was generally well tolerated. We observed similar results in a Phase 2a clinical trial in older subjects and healthy, younger subjects and in a Phase 2b trial of healthy, older subjects.
Background on Acute Coronary Syndrome
ACS describes a range of conditions associated with sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, or heart attack. ACS is caused by the inappropriate formation of clots in the coronary arteries. These blood clots are made up primarily of platelets, small lens-shaped cells found in the blood that normally aggregate at sites of injury to help stop bleeding. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 805,000 Americans have a heart attack every year, and heart attacks are a leading cause of death in the developed world.
The primary treatment for ACS is the use of antiplatelet drugs to prevent the worsening of existing clots or to reduce the formation of additional clots. These clots can occur in the heart or in stents that are placed in the blocked coronary artery to keep the blood vessel open or elsewhere in the body. Without antiplatelet drugs, patients are at a significantly increased risk of recurrent heart attacks, stroke and death. The standard of care for ACS patients is dual antiplatelet therapy, or DAPT, which is a combination of aspirin and an inhibitor of a specific receptor found on platelets known as the P2Y12 receptor. This combination is started after a patient experiences a heart attack or other manifestation of ACS and has been shown to significantly reduce platelet aggregation and clot formation and reduce the frequency of recurrent heart attacks, stroke and death.
While the antiplatelet drugs used in DAPT have proven effective at improving overall outcomes in ACS patients, their suppression of blood clotting increases patients’ risk of bleeding. Bleeding events in patients on antiplatelet therapy, which 
6


can occur spontaneously or as a result of injury or surgery, are classified as minor or major. In the 18,000-patient clinical trial, Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes, or PLATO, conducted by AstraZeneca, ticagrelor was shown to be superior to the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, marketed under the brand name Plavix, in reducing recurrent heart attack, stroke and death in patients with ACS. However, in both treatment groups, approximately 11% to 12% of patients in the trial suffered major bleeding events, and in approximately 6% of patients, these major bleeding events were fatal or life-threatening. The causes of bleeding varied in the trial population. In approximately 3% of the patients on ticagrelor, the major bleeding events were spontaneous and not related to any medical procedure, whereas approximately 9% of patients on ticagrelor developed major bleeding that was related to procedures like coronary artery bypass surgery, or CABG. Although the trial protocol recommended that patients who needed CABG stop taking ticagrelor for one to three days prior to surgery, nearly half of all ticagrelor patients needed surgery urgently and could not wait the up to three days for ticagrelor’s effect to dissipate so normal blood clotting could be restored. Overall, up to 80% of patients who underwent CABG surgery in the trial suffered a major or life-threatening bleeding event related to the surgery, and for those who needed urgent surgery and could not wait three days for the effects of ticagrelor to dissipate, approximately 50% experienced a fatal or life-threatening bleeding event. While some of this risk was likely associated with patients’ underlying conditions, the overall bleeding risk is significantly increased by antiplatelet drugs, and the current United States and European prescribing information for ticagrelor suggests suspension of ticagrelor treatment for five days prior to surgery.
Despite the increased bleeding risk, antiplatelet drugs, along with anticoagulant drugs that are used to prevent clots in veins, represent some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the United States due to their lifesaving effects. There are currently no other known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs. In the European Union, an extracorporeal whole blood purification adsorber device is available that may be useful for non-specific removal of ticagrelor during some cardiac procedures when used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass. The maker of the device, CytoSorbent Corporation, has also initiated a clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the use of the DrugSorb-ATR antithrombotic removal system during cardiothoracic surgery. Upon approval, bentracimab would be the only therapeutic agent available for specific reversal of ticagrelor. In the absence of a specific reversal agent, physicians have limited treatment options, and sometimes administer platelet transfusions, which are unproven in this setting. The ability to quickly reverse the antiplatelet activity of ticagrelor and restore normal clotting would increase its safety, both in instances of major bleeding as well as in situations where surgical or other medical interventions associated with bleeding are urgently needed.
Background on Antiplatelet Drugs
The three oral antiplatelet P2Y12 receptor antagonist drugs prescribed in DAPT are clopidogrel, marketed under the brand name Plavix; prasugrel, marketed under the brand name Effient; and ticagrelor, marketed under the brand names Brilinta and Brilique. Unlike clopidogrel and prasugrel that permanently bind to and inhibit the target receptors on platelets, ticagrelor binds to the P2Y12 receptor in a transient manner, quickly cycling on and off the receptor. We believe this transient binding of ticagrelor presents a unique opportunity to develop a specific reversal agent for ticagrelor, whereas the permanent binding of the other drugs to the receptor precludes a reversal agent from being developed.
We consider ticagrelor to be the best-in-class P2Y12 antiplatelet agent because it has demonstrated a superior benefit-risk profile compared to other products in the P2Y12 class. In 2020, ticagrelor had worldwide sales of $1.6 billion. Ticagrelor has achieved this level of market share despite the availability of generic versions of clopidogrel and prasugrel. We believe ticagrelor growth is being driven in part by treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology that recognize ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet treatment for ACS. We believe that the availability of a reversal agent could further drive the use of ticagrelor by making it the only reversible oral P2Y12 antiplatelet treatment, thereby conferring a possible safety benefit over the other agents. Furthermore, based on the growth of clopidogrel prescriptions after the introduction of a generic form of that drug, we believe ticagrelor prescriptions could grow significantly after its patents expire in 2024 and generic competition drives prices down to similar levels as other P2Y12 antiplatelet therapies.
Our Solution: Bentracimab
Bentracimab is a human Fab fragment that binds to ticagrelor with high affinity and specificity to reverse ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity. We believe that the availability of bentracimab may further differentiate ticagrelor from other P2Y12 receptor antagonists by providing for better clinical management of the balance between the desired antiplatelet effect and prevention or control of bleeding. We exclusively licensed bentracimab from MedImmune Limited, or MedImmune, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca.
Bentracimab Background
7


Ticagrelor works by binding to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, thereby preventing adenosine diphosphate, or ADP, from causing platelet aggregation. Ticagrelor binds transiently to the P2Y12 receptor, quickly cycling on and off, and allowing bentracimab to bind to free ticagrelor, thereby preventing ticagrelor’s inactivation of the receptor and removing ticagrelor from circulation. With ticagrelor removed, ADP can once again activate the P2Y12 receptor and induce platelet aggregation. This activity is illustrated below.
Mechanism of action of ticagrelor and its reversal by bentracimab
Bentracimab binds to ticagrelor with an affinity that is approximately 100 times stronger than ticagrelor’s affinity for the P2Y12 receptor. This high affinity enables bentracimab to bind to free ticagrelor, resulting in an immediate reversal of ticagrelor’s effect and restoration of platelet activity.
Clinical Development of Bentracimab
Phase 3 REVERSE-IT Clinical Trial
In March 2020, we commenced our pivotal REVERSE-IT trial. We expect to enroll a total of 200 ticagrelor patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure in this global, multi-center, non-randomized, open-label trial and file for an accelerated approval based upon the results of the interim analysis of the first 150 patients, which we announced in November 2021. The primary endpoints for this trial are the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor with intravenous infusion of bentracimab as measured by the VerifyNow® PRUTest® biomarker and achievement of clinical hemostasis in enrolled patients. We are targeting to submit our BLA in mid-2022.
We recently completed the planned interim analysis of the first 150 patients enrolled in the REVERSE-IT trial and
announced the results from this analysis in November 2021. The prespecified interim analysis of 150 enrolled patients (142 of
whom enrolled required urgent surgery or an invasive procedure and eight of whom enrolled with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding) demonstrated that bentracimab achieved the primary endpoint of the trial by immediately and sustainably reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. As measured by the point-of-care VerifyNow PRUTest platelet function assay, a
135% reduction in platelet inhibition (P<0.001) was observed within five to ten minutes after initiation of bentracimab infusion
and sustained through all timepoints over 24 hours. More than 90% of eligible patients achieved the co-primary endpoint of the
trial, defined as good or excellent hemostasis within 24 hours of initiation of bentracimab therapy (P<0.001). Thrombotic
events were reported in 5.3% of patients, with none resulting in death or considered by investigators to be related to
bentracimab.
Bentracimab was generally well tolerated, with five non-serious adverse events, reported in three patients,
considered by investigators to be related to bentracimab. The most common adverse events were related to pain associated with
surgical procedures. Four patients died of events considered by investigators to be unrelated to treatment with bentracimab: two
patients from septic shock and two patients from cardiogenic shock. Bentracimab immunogenicity was also measured in the
trial by testing patients for anti-drug antibodies, or ADA, before and after the initiation of bentracimab infusion. Results of the
immunogenicity testing found that 22.6% of patients had pre-existing ADA, 24.3% of patients developed ADA after
bentracimab infusion, and 53.0% of patients had no ADA. The presence of ADA had no apparent effect on ticagrelor reversal
as measured by VerifyNow or on achievement of effective hemostasis.
Phase 2b Clinical Trial
In November 2021, we announced topline data from our Phase 2b bentracimab trial, which is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bentracimab in reversing the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in 200 healthy volunteers who are older and elderly (ages 50 to 80), with 150 subjects receiving bentracimab and 50 subjects receiving placebo, all after pretreatment with dual antiplatelet therapy composed of ticagrelor and low-dose aspirin. In the Phase 2b bentracimab trial, we observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours as measured using the point-of-care VerifyNow PRUTest biomarker. In addition, treatment with bentracimab had a favorable safety profile, with no drug-related SAEs or thrombotic events reported in the Phase 2b trial. In our earlier, completed Phase 2a clinical trial of bentracimab, we also observed immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity within five minutes following initiation of infusion and sustained reversal for over 20 hours.
Phase 2a Clinical Trial
In September 2019, we completed a Phase 2a clinical trial of bentracimab in older and elderly subjects dosed with ticagrelor and aspirin and in healthy, younger subjects on supratherapeutic doses of ticagrelor. We observed a statistically significant reversal of ticagrelor within five minutes of initiation of bentracimab infusion, which was sustained for over 20 hours. Platelet function was normalized by 15 minutes (30 minutes for the supratherapeutic ticagrelor-dose cohort) following initiation of bentracimab infusion and remained normal for over 20 hours. Bentracimab was generally well tolerated, with only minor AEs reported. These results are consistent with results observed in healthy, younger subjects treated with ticagrelor in our Phase 1 trial. The older and elderly subjects in the Phase 2a trial resemble the patient population most likely to be treated with ticagrelor and to potentially benefit from bentracimab, if approved.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial
In September 2018, we completed a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of bentracimab, delivered as an intravenous infusion in healthy subjects pre-dosed with ticagrelor that was designed to identify the target dose, determine proof of concept and evaluate the safety and tolerability of bentracimab. In the trial, we observed that bentracimab immediately and completely reversed the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. We conducted this trial pursuant to an IND that we sponsored and that became effective in March 2018. In March 2019, the full results from this trial of bentracimab were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Our Phase 1 clinical trial enrolled 64 subjects across 10 sequential dose cohorts. Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the early dose cohorts in the trial, we adjusted the intravenous infusion of bentracimab to identify the optimal dose and dosing regimen for future trials and for the target patient populations. The initial three cohorts of subjects were dosed with 30-minute intravenous infusions of bentracimab alone in order to assess pharmacokinetics and safety. Subsequent cohorts were pre-dosed with the standard clinical regimen of ticagrelor for two days prior to administration of bentracimab to enable direct assessment of reversal of ticagrelor’s inhibition of platelet aggregation using platelet function assays. There were no bentracimab-related AEs or SAEs in any of the dose cohorts.
In cohorts 5 and 6, which were the first cohorts in which potentially pharmacodynamically active doses of bentracimab were administered, we saw immediate and complete reversal of ticagrelor’s antiplatelet activity based upon restoration of platelet function. In 11 out of 12 subjects, platelet function was restored at the first measured time point at the end of the 30-minute infusion. The duration of reversal varied from approximately one to four hours depending upon the dose level and subject, with longer duration at higher doses. In cohort 7, we modified the dosing regimen to deliver a total dose of 18 g, 
with 3 g delivered in the first five minutes of infusion, followed by 15 g delivered at a constant rate over an additional seven hours and 55 minutes. In cohort 7, we observed that all subjects achieved complete and sustained restoration of platelet function within two hours after the start of infusion. The duration of reversal in cohort 7 lasted approximately 16 hours from the start of the infusion as measured by restoration of platelet activity.
In cohorts 8, 9 and 10, the dosing regimen of bentracimab was further refined to achieve both a more rapid onset of reversal and a longer duration of reversal compared to earlier cohorts. We administered a total dose of 18 g, with the initial 6 g delivered as a bolus in cohorts 8, 9 and 10. The remaining 12 g was administered after the initial bolus for an additional 12 to 16 hours in cohorts 8, 9 and 10. In each of these cohorts, we observed both immediate and complete reversal within the first five minutes following initiation of infusion and a sustained duration of reversal of over 20 hours. We intend to further evaluate the dose and dosing regimens observed in these cohorts in future clinical trials.
Planned BLA Submission
Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit a BLA for potential accelerated approval based on the interim analysis of our REVERSE-IT trial, which included 142 patients enrolled requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure and eight patients enrolled with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding. To support our plan to seek full approval and consistent with the recommendation of the FDA, we plan to enroll 200 total patients in the REVERSE-IT trial. After we submit our BLA with data from the first 150 patients, we intend to complete the REVERSE-IT trial and establish a post-approval registry in accordance with FDA requirements. We are targeting to submit our BLA for bentracimab in mid-2022, although this timing could be impacted by the continued scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bentracimab in April 2019. The EMA granted bentracimab PRIME designation in February 2020 and NMPA of China granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in December 2021.
PB6440 for Treatment-Resistant Hypertension
PB6440 is a selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor that we are developing as an orally administered treatment for resistant hypertension. The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone is a critical regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance in the body and, as such, can play an important role in the development of high blood pressure or hypertension. Elevated aldosterone levels are associated with resistant hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Agents that block the action of mineralocorticoids at the receptor level, such as spironolactone, have been shown to lower blood pressure, including in patients with resistant hypertension. However, use of these agents is limited by adverse side effects. Inhibition of the production of aldosterone through inhibition of the enzyme responsible for its synthesis, aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), is an alternative approach to treatment of hypertension. However, development of aldosterone synthase inhibitors is challenging because of a closely-related enzyme, steroid 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), which many potential compounds also inhibit. In preclinical studies, PB6440 was observed to be a highly potent and selective inhibitor of aldosterone synthase and demonstrated a dose-dependent aldosterone reduction without a significant increase in 11-deoxycorticosterone or deoxycortisol in both rodent and primate models. The oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles appear suitable for once-daily oral dosing in humans.
We initiated nonclinical IND-enabling studies for PB6440 in 2021, and we plan to submit an IND in the second half of 2022. We are also targeting to begin a first-in-human trial in late 2022, although our timelines could be impacted by the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
ELP Technology
Our proprietary ELP technology is based on recombinant biopolymers called ELPs, which comprise individual subunits or building blocks derived from a five-amino acid repeat motif found in the human protein elastin. This five-amino acid motif is repeated multiple times to form the ELP biopolymer. We produce our ELP-based products by engineering E. coli to produce a single protein comprising the active peptide or protein fused to the ELP biopolymer. This molecule is active as a fusion protein and does not require cleavage or release of the peptide. ELP fusion proteins are produced in the soluble fraction of E. coli, which allows for ease of scale-up and purification.
Fusion to ELPs significantly improves the stability of peptides and proteins and enables use of natural or minimally altered peptide sequences. We believe these fusion proteins retain similar potency to the native molecule while being protected from degradation by enzymes in circulation. Additionally, we have observed that the fusion protein maintains the solubility and long half-life of the ELP, in many cases allowing for long-term liquid stability, which is important for injectable products.
ELP fusion proteins can undergo a reversible phase transition, in which ELP fusion proteins aggregate and form a sustained-release depot under the skin. This phase transition is driven by changes in temperature. At lower temperatures ELP fusion proteins are completely soluble, while at warmer temperatures the ELP fusion proteins are in a gel-like state. This allows the ELP fusion proteins to be easily handled and administered subcutaneously using standard, fine gauge needles and syringes. Once the ELP fusion protein is exposed to body heat, it forms a drug depot that slowly releases soluble ELP fusion protein into circulation. By modifying the amino acid sequence of the individual subunits and by varying its overall length, we can engineer our ELP fusion proteins to be released on timescales extending to a week or longer.
Product candidates based on our ELP technology, including prior product candidates for which we have ceased development in order to focus on the development of therapies for cardiovascular diseases, have been evaluated in over 500 patients with no known SAEs considered to be drug-related and resulting in study drug discontinuation.
Preclinical ELP Programs
We continue to invest in applying our ELP technology to the development of novel product candidates. Our focus is on peptides and proteins that are scientifically or clinically validated but where a suboptimal half-life, stability and delivery limit their potential therapeutic applications.
Our more advanced ELP preclinical programs include:
•Glucagon-like peptide-2. Glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, stimulates growth of intestinal villi, increasing their ability to absorb nutrients. GLP-2 is a potential treatment for patients with short bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease or mucositis in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Teduglutide, currently marketed under the brand name Gattex, is an FDA-approved therapy based on GLP-2 that requires daily injections. In animal models, our GLP-2-ELP product candidate provided sustained levels of GLP-2, resulting in greater efficacy than teduglutide with less frequent dosing.
•C-type natriuretic peptide. C-type natriuretic peptide, or CNP, is a regulator of bone growth and can rescue defects in fibroblast growth factor 3 that cause achondroplasia resulting in dwarfism. Native CNP has a half-life of less than three minutes, limiting its use as a direct therapeutic. We are developing our CNP-ELP product candidate to deliver therapeutic levels of CNP with once weekly subcutaneous injections. In a mouse model, we observed a demonstrated effect on linear growth when our CNP-ELP product candidate was injected once every four days.
Pemziviptadil (PB1046)
Pemziviptadil (also known as PB1046), a novel, subcutaneously-injected VIP analogue, is a recombinant fusion
protein composed of VIP and our proprietary ELP technology. Pemziviptadil has been administered to nearly 90 patients
with hypertension or a history of cardiac disease in three Phase 1/2 clinical trials conducted in the United States with no SAEs
considered to be drug-related and resulting in study drug discontinuation to date. We previously pursued development of
pemziviptadil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, but voluntarily ended our Phase 2b trial in
December 2021 due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on manufacturing, associated drug supply and the rate of
enrollment in the trial. After a strategic review, we have decided to stop further development of pemziviptadil in order to
reprioritize resources and capital towards pre-commercialization activities for bentracimab and the advancement of other
pipeline programs, including PB6440 for resistant hypertension.
License, Co-Development and Other Agreements
MedImmune Limited License Agreement
In November 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with MedImmune, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, or the MedImmune License. Pursuant to the MedImmune License, MedImmune granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by MedImmune to develop and commercialize any products covered by the MedImmune License, or the MedImmune licensed products, for the treatment, palliation, diagnosis or prevention of any human disorder or condition. The in-licensed patent rights are generally directed to antibodies that bind to ticagrelor and methods of use and include two issued patents in the United States, three pending patent applications in the United States and 13 pending foreign applications. The last patent is expected to expire in 2036 without extension. We have the right to sublicense the licensed technology to third parties subject to certain conditions as specified in the MedImmune License. Under the MedImmune License, we grant to MedImmune a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license and 
right of reference solely to exploit any drug product containing ticagrelor or any invention, discovery, development or modification with respect to any drug product containing ticagrelor.
Under the terms of the MedImmune License, we have paid or are required to pay:
•an upfront fee of $0.1 million;
•quarterly fees relating to technical services provided by MedImmune;
•up to $18.0 million upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones;
•up to $50.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones; and
•mid-single digit to low-teen royalty percentages on net sales of MedImmune licensed products, subject to reduction in specified circumstances.
From the inception of the MedImmune License through December 31, 2021, we have paid $3.6 million under the MedImmune License, related to third-party product storage costs and a milestone payment.
The MedImmune License requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for and commercialize the MedImmune licensed products throughout the term of the MedImmune License. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to control prosecution of the in-licensed patents. In addition, our rights under the MedImmune License are not assignable without the prior written consent of MedImmune, except to a third-party acquirer by our merger or sale of our stock or assets or to an affiliate of our company.
Unless earlier terminated, the MedImmune License automatically expires on the date on which we no longer owe any royalty payments to MedImmune under the MedImmune License, which date will occur on the later of (1) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the MedImmune licensed products, (2) the expiration of the last in-licensed patent in 2036 and (3) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity under the MedImmune License. The MedImmune License may be terminated prior to its expiration:
•by mutual written consent of us and MedImmune;
•by either party upon the other party’s material breach of the MedImmune License that is not cured within the specified cure period based on the nature of such breach;
•by either party in the event of either party’s bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences;
•by MedImmune if we bring any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents;
•by us, under specified circumstances, if we believe in good faith that there is (1) an issue with respect to the safety or efficacy of bentracimab or any MedImmune licensed product containing bentracimab or (2) an issue with respect to the commercial viability of any MedImmune licensed products, in each case subject to dispute resolution by an independent expert; and
•by us, with respect to a particular country or region, if any product containing ticagrelor is withdrawn by a regulatory authority in such country or region.
Upon termination of the MedImmune License, we grant to MedImmune an exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license under our patent rights and know-how to use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, develop, make, have made, manufacture, commercialize, have used, import, export, transport, distribute, promote, market or otherwise dispose certain compounds or products covered by the MedImmune License.
In January 2020, in connection with our entering the SFJ Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the exclusive license agreement pursuant to which MedImmune consented to a potential assignment of the MedImmune License and transfer of our business related to bentracimab to SFJ in the event of the occurrence of certain program transfer events, should they ever occur.
Co-Development Agreement for Bentracimab with SFJ Pharmaceuticals
In January 2020, we entered into the SFJ Agreement, pursuant to which SFJ provides us funding to support the global development of bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor. Under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ has agreed to pay us up to $120.0 million to support the clinical development of bentracimab. In addition to the $90.0 million of 
initial funding, we have elected to receive an additional $30.0 million of funding having met specific, pre-defined clinical development milestones for bentracimab. From the inception of the SFJ Agreement through December 31, 2021, SFJ has provided funding and paid for amounts on our behalf in the aggregate amount of $91.3 million under the SFJ Agreement. We also expect that SFJ will fund or reimburse an additional $28.7 million of clinical trial costs and other expenses.
During the term of the SFJ Agreement, we have primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in the United States and the European Union, while SFJ has primary responsibility for clinical development and regulatory activities for bentracimab in China and Japan and provides clinical trial operational support in the European Union. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete our REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab and to file a BLA or its foreign equivalent within specified timelines with each of the FDA and the EMA. We have formed a joint steering committee with SFJ to oversee and manage the collaboration, including our REVERSE-IT program and the regulatory process.
Under the terms of the SFJ Agreement, following the FDA approval of a BLA for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $325.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If the EMA, or the national regulatory authority in certain European countries, authorizes a marketing approval for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $5.0 million and an additional $205.0 million in the aggregate in seven additional annual payments. If either the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan, or the PMDA, or the NMPA of China approves a marketing application for bentracimab, we will pay SFJ an initial payment of $1.0 million and then an additional $59.0 million in the aggregate in eight additional annual payments. 
Within 120 days following approval of a BLA, or its equivalent, for bentracimab in one of the jurisdictions described above, we have the right, at our option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments for such jurisdiction (i.e., the U.S. Approval Payments, EU Approval Payments or Japan/China Approval Payments, as applicable) for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate. Within 120 days following a change of control of our company, we or our successor have the right, at its option, to make a one-time cash payment to SFJ to buy out all or a portion of the future unpaid approval payments in any of the jurisdictions in which a BLA, or its equivalent, for bentracimab was approved prior to the change of control for a price reflecting a mid-single-digit discount rate, provided that SFJ has not previously assigned the right to receive such payments to a third party, in which event we or our successor shall not have such right.
Under the SFJ Agreement, we granted SFJ a security interest in all of the assets we own or control that are necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of bentracimab, or bentracimab Intellectual Property. In connection with the grant of the security interest, we agreed to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt or enter into licensing transactions with respect to the bentracimab Intellectual Property. In addition, we agreed that the security interest granted to SFJ will be a first-priority security interest, subject only to the lien of SVB for our existing indebtedness to SVB.
Upon execution of the SFJ Agreement, we issued to SFJ a ten-year warrant exercisable for 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50. The warrant is exercisable as follows: (i) 1,100,000 shares may be exercised at any time after the effective date of the SFJ Agreement, provided that SFJ may not sell such exercised shares until one year after such effective date, and (ii) the remaining 1,100,000 shares may be exercised at any time at SFJ’s election if the results of our REVERSE-IT trial meet the interim primary endpoint as set forth in the REVERSE-IT trial protocol.
In the event that (i) we fail to pay any amounts payable to SFJ under the SFJ Agreement within a specified time period, (ii) we are in default of our obligations, subject to certain exclusions, under the MedImmune License, or (iii) either (a) we determine it is probable that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that our financial statements for the then-current quarter are issued, or available to be issued or (b) a “going concern” footnote is included in any of our financial statements, and, in either case ((a) or (b)), we fail to remedy such going concern condition as specified in the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab transferred to SFJ. We refer to such events (i), (ii) or (iii) as the Potential Program Transfer Events. We have multiple quarters in which to remedy the going concern condition, including by restructuring our costs and operations, raising additional capital in financing or strategic transactions or accepting additional financing from SFJ on the same terms as their original commitment (which additional financing they have the option, but not obligation, to provide). If our business related to bentracimab is transferred to SFJ, we will not share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab until SFJ has received a 300% return on its investment in bentracimab, after which we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the United States and certain European countries, and after SFJ has received an aggregate 500% return on its investment in bentracimab, we will be entitled to a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales of bentracimab in the rest of the world. See Risk Factors—"The auditor's opinion on our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Further, under the SFJ Agreement, SFJ may elect to have our business related to bentracimab 
transferred to SFJ if we do not remedy such going concern condition within the periods specified in the SFJ Agreement and our ability to share in any revenues from the commercialization of bentracimab will be materially and adversely affected. We may be forced to delay
or reduce the scope of our development programs and/or limit or cease our operations if we are unable to obtain additional
funding to support our current operating plan."
The SFJ Agreement expires upon the payment of all approval payments owing to SFJ, unless earlier terminated. The SFJ Agreement may be terminated by us at will at any time after SFJ has paid or incurred a total of $60.0 million of bentracimab development costs and before receipt of approval of any BLA (or its equivalent) for bentracimab from the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA or the NMPA. SFJ may terminate the SFJ Agreement (i) upon the occurrence of a material adverse event, as defined in the SFJ Agreement, (ii) upon a change of control of us, (iii) if (a) we are enjoined from further developing or commercializing bentracimab in any of the United States, certain European countries, China, Japan or Hong Kong or (b) the future value of bentracimab is materially adversely affected due to (1) certain third-party patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of bentracimab in any of the United States, certain European countries or China, Japan or Hong Kong or (2) invalidity or unenforceability of all patent rights controlled by us covering bentracimab as a reversal agent for the antiplatelet drug ticagrelor in patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure in any of the United States, certain European countries, Japan, China or Hong Kong (we refer to each of (a) and (b) as an Adverse Patent Impact), if we do not cure the Adverse Patent Impact within six months of notice from SFJ, or (iv) if SFJ disagrees with certain decisions made by us as part of the joint steering committee. The SFJ Agreement may be terminated by either party (i) upon a material breach of the SFJ Agreement by the other party, (ii) if bentracimab fails to receive regulatory approval from at least one of the FDA, the EMA, the PMDA or the NMPA after completion of the REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab, submission of BLAs, or their equivalents, to such agencies and the use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval of such BLAs, or their equivalents, (iii) if the REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab is completed or terminated and either (a) the primary endpoint in the REVERSE-IT trial is not achieved or (b) SFJ reasonably determines that the results of the trial do not support regulatory approval, (iv) upon the bankruptcy of the other party, (v) if the independent data monitoring committee for the REVERSE-IT trial of bentracimab recommends termination of the trial for safety or health reasons or for futility or the parties mutually agree that a material health or safety concern exists, or (vi) upon a breach by the other party involving improper payments or a violation of anti-corruption policies, unless such breach can be cured without having a materially adverse impact on the probability of completing clinical trials of bentracimab or obtaining regulatory approval for bentracimab.
In certain instances, upon the termination of the SFJ Agreement, we will be obligated to pay SFJ a multiple of the amounts paid or incurred by SFJ under the SFJ Agreement, including specifically:
•300% of such amounts (1) in the event that SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement due to a material uncured breach of the SFJ Agreement by us or our bankruptcy, (2) if we terminate the SFJ Agreement at will prior to the first regulatory approval of bentracimab, or (3) if the SFJ Agreement were to be terminated due to a safety concern and such termination either (a) arose from our gross negligence, or (b) is due to a serious safety issue that was known to us on the date of the SFJ Agreement but the data demonstrating such serious safety issue were not disclosed to SFJ or publicly known prior to the date of the SFJ Agreement;
•150% of such amounts if SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement (1) upon a change of control of us or (2) upon a breach involving improper payments or a violation of anti-corruption policies by us, unless such breach can be cured without having a materially adverse impact on the probability of completing clinical trials of bentracimab or obtaining regulatory approval for bentracimab;
•100% of such amounts in the event of a termination due to an Adverse Patent Impact; and
•100% of such amounts (plus an amount reflecting interest on such amounts) at an annual rate of 25% in the event of termination by SFJ due to disagreement with certain decisions made by us as part of the joint steering committee.
In addition, if following termination of the SFJ Agreement we continue to develop bentracimab and obtain approval of a BLA (or its equivalent) in the United States, the European Union, Japan or China, we will make the applicable approval payments for such jurisdiction to SFJ as if the SFJ Agreement had not been terminated, less any payments made upon termination, except that if we terminate the SFJ Agreement for SFJ’s failure to make any payment to us when due, or SFJ terminates the SFJ Agreement due to a material adverse event, as defined in the SFJ Agreement, then our obligation to make such approval payments would be reduced by 50%.
Duke License Agreement
In October 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Duke, which was most recently amended in April 2019, or the Duke License. Pursuant to the Duke License, Duke granted to us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by Duke, and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain know-how of Duke, to develop and commercialize any products or processes covered by the Duke License, or the Duke licensed products, relating to ELPs. The in-licensed patent rights are generally directed to providing extended exposure for proteins and peptides administered through subcutaneous injections and include 13 registered patents in the United States, 24 registered patents in foreign jurisdictions, two pending patent applications in the United States and four pending foreign applications. The last patent is expected to expire in 2030 without extension.
We have the right to sublicense the Duke licensed products to third parties subject to certain conditions specified in the Duke License. In May 2017, certain patent rights under the Duke License reverted to Duke, and Duke subsequently granted to us a non-exclusive license under such patent rights to develop and commercialize any products or processes involving such patent rights. We also granted back to Duke an exclusive sublicense under certain patent rights licensed to us under the Duke License and a non-exclusive license under certain patent rights owned or controlled by us, in each case to exploit compounds developed using our proprietary ELP technology.
Under the terms of the Duke License, we have paid or are required to pay:
•an upfront fee of $37,000;
•amendment fees of $0.2 million related to subsequent amendments of the Duke License;
•additional licensing fees of $0.2 million;
•up to $2.2 million in clinical and regulatory milestone fees;
•up to $0.4 million in commercial milestone fees;
•low single-digit royalty percentages on net sales of Duke licensed products, with minimum aggregate royalty payments of $0.2 million payable following our achievement of certain commercial milestones; and
•up to the greater of $0.3 million or a low double-digit percentage of the fees we receive from a third party in consideration of forming a strategic alliance with respect to certain patent rights covered under the Duke License.
In consideration for license rights granted to us, we initially issued Duke 24,493 shares of our common stock. Until we had reached a certain stipulated equity milestone, which we reached in October 2007, we were obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to Duke from time to time so that its aggregate ownership represented 7.5% of our issued and outstanding capital stock.
From the inception of the Duke License through December 31, 2021, we have incurred royalty costs of $0.3 million under the Duke License. As of May 2017, Duke is required to pay us a percentage of revenue that it receives from granting a license or sublicense with respect to certain products covered under the Duke License. As of December 31, 2021, Duke has not paid us any of such fees. We also must pay Duke the first $1.0 million of non-royalty payments we receive from a sublicensee, and thereafter a low double-digit percentage of any additional non-royalty payments we receive.
The Duke License requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for and commercialize the Duke licensed products according to a particular development schedule throughout the term of the Duke License. We are required to apply for, prosecute and maintain all United States and foreign patent rights under the Duke License. In addition, our rights under the Duke License are not assignable without the prior written consent of Duke, except to a third-party acquirer by our merger or sale of our stock or assets, or to an affiliate of our company.
Unless earlier terminated, the Duke License automatically expires on the date on which all patent rights granted under the Duke License expire, or upon our bankruptcy, insolvency or certain similar occurrences. The Duke License may be terminated prior to its expiration:
•by mutual written consent of us and Duke;
•by us upon three months’ written notice to Duke;
•by either party upon the other party’s illegal conduct or guilty plea with respect to intentional fraud, willful misconduct or felony;
•by either party upon the other party’s material breach of the Duke License that is not cured within the specified cure period based on the nature of such breach; and
•by Duke upon our decision to cease commercial development of the patent rights covered by the Duke License for a material period of time.
Upon termination of the Duke License, we grant to Duke an exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license under our patent rights and know-how to use any intellectual property developed by us in the course of exercising our rights under the Duke License.
Alfasigma Sublicense Agreement
In June 2021, we entered into the Alfasigma Sublicense under which we granted to Alfasigma exclusive rights to develop, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import any product composed of or containing bentracimab, or Licensed Products, in the Sublicense Territory. Under the terms of the Alfasigma Sublicense, in July 2021, we received a $20.0 million upfront payment from Alfasigma, and we will be eligible to receive up to $35.0 million upon the achievement of certain pre-revenue regulatory milestones, up to $190.0 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones and tiered royalty payments on net sales, with percentages starting in the low double digits and escalating to the mid-twenties.
With respect to the up to $35.0 million of regulatory milestone payments: (i) $10.0 million is payable following acceptance by the EMA of the filing of the first drug approval application for a Licensed Product; (ii) $12.5 million is payable following achievement of conditional regulatory approval from the EMA; and (iii) the remaining $12.5 million is payable following achievement of unconditional regulatory approval from the EMA allowing for prescribing of a Licensed Product for the reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in both (a) patients with uncontrolled major or life-threatening bleeding and (b) patients requiring urgent surgery or an invasive procedure. 
Under the Alfasigma Sublicense, we are responsible for developing the Licensed Products and securing regulatory approval with the EMA and the MHRA, including in accordance with the SFJ Agreement, after which any marketing authorizations will be assigned to Alfasigma. Alfasigma is obligated to obtain and maintain any regulatory approvals necessary to market and sell the Licensed Products (including pricing approvals and post-marketing commitments) and is also responsible for securing regulatory approval in countries outside of Europe and the United Kingdom. Alfasigma will purchase its requirements from us for a set period, after which we are obligated to supply a lesser amount of Alfasigma's requirements, for Licensed Product at the lower of cost or a price not to exceed certain agreed amounts.
Unless earlier terminated, the Alfasigma Sublicense automatically expires, with respect to each Licensed Product and each country in the Sublicense Territory, on the latest of (1) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country, (2) the expiration of the last out-licensed patent of such Licensed Product in such country and (3) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, if any, of such Licensed Product in such country.
In connection with the Alfasigma Sublicense, in June 2021 we also entered into an Acknowledgement of Grant of Sublicense with MedImmune and Alfasigma, or the Acknowledgement of Grant, which provides for, among other things, (i) a potential assignment of the Alfasigma Sublicense from us to MedImmune or (ii) a potential assignment of the Medimmune License from us to Alfasigma, in either case in the event that we breach certain obligations under the Medimmune License that are not cured or remedied and SFJ has grounds to execute a “Program Transfer” (as defined in the SFJ Agreement) but elects not to do so. We recognized $10.8 million and zero in revenue under the Alfasigma Sublicense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Wacker License Agreement
In April 2019, we entered into a license agreement, or the Wacker License Agreement, with Wacker Biotech GmbH, or Wacker, pursuant to which Wacker granted us an exclusive license under certain of Wacker’s intellectual property rights to use Wacker’s proprietary E. coli strain for the manufacture of bentracimab worldwide outside of specified Asian countries and to commercialize bentracimab, if approved, manufactured by us or on our behalf using Wacker’s proprietary E. coli strain throughout the world. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license, subject to certain conditions as specified in the Wacker License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay a fixed, nominal per-unit royalty, which is subject to adjustment, and an annual license fee in a fixed Euro amount in the low to mid six digits. The agreement will be in force for an indefinite period of time, and upon the expiration of our royalty obligations, the license will be considered fully paid and will convert to a non-exclusive license. Either party may terminate the Wacker License Agreement for breach if such breach is not cured within a specified number of days. We completed a technology transfer of our current manufacturing process for bentracimab from Wacker to BioVectra Inc., or BioVectra, another manufacturer certified for good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and have engaged BioVectra to manufacture drug substance for our ongoing clinical trials and to manufacture commercial supply of bentracimab following regulatory approval, if obtained.
Viamet Asset Purchase Agreement
In January 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, or the PB6440 Agreement, with Viamet Pharmaceuticals Holdings, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Selenity Therapeutics (Bermuda), Ltd., or the Sellers, pursuant to which we acquired all of the assets and intellectual property rights related to PB6440, the Sellers’ proprietary CYP11B2 inhibitor compound (formerly known as SE-6440 or VT-6440) and certain other CYP11B2 inhibitor compounds that are covered by the patent rights acquired by us under the PB6440 Agreement, or together, the Compounds. The acquired patent rights include 20 issued or pending United States and foreign patents and patent applications, with the last issued patent acquired expected to expire in 2037. Under the terms of the PB6440 Agreement, we paid the Sellers an upfront fee of $0.1 million upon the closing of the transaction, and we are required to pay the Sellers up to $5.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and intellectual property milestones with respect to certain product candidates that contain a Compound, up to $142.5 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to any approved product that contains a Compound, and low- to mid-single digit royalty percentages on the net sales of approved products that contain a Compound, subject to customary reductions and offsets in specified circumstances.
BioVectra Supply Agreement
In March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with BioVectra, or the BioVectra Agreement, for the manufacture and supply by BioVectra of bulk drug substance for bentracimab for commercial distribution following regulatory approval, if obtained. We have also engaged BioVectra to manufacture drug substance for our ongoing clinical trials. Under the terms of the BioVectra Agreement, BioVectra has committed to maintaining capacity to manufacture an agreed number of batches of product each year, and we have committed to purchase a specified minimum number of batches of product per year, or the Minimum Annual Commitment, although we are free to contract with third parties for the manufacture of bentracimab.
We will pay a supply price per batch of product to be determined after the manufacturing process for the product is validated in accordance with the BioVectra Agreement, plus the cost of certain consumables, raw materials, and third-party testing. The parties have agreed that the initial supply price of product will be within a specified percentage of the estimated supply price set forth in the BioVectra Agreement and will remain firm through the second anniversary of validation. Thereafter, on an annual basis following the second anniversary of validation, either party may propose adjustments to the supply price for increases or decreases based on a specified inflation rate, subject to a maximum inflation adjustment per year, and BioVectra may propose adjusting the supply price beyond that inflation rate if it can document extraordinary increases or decreases in costs, subject to a specified maximum percentage increase or decrease per year.
Pursuant to the Minimum Annual Commitments, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of (i) approximately $14.0 million of batches of product in years 2022 through 2023, (ii) approximately $37.0 million of batches of product in 2024, and (iii) approximately $48.0 million of batches of product in each of years 2025 through 2031. In the event we do not purchase the applicable Minimum Annual Commitment in a given year, we will be obligated to make a payment to BioVectra in an amount equal to the then-applicable supply price per batch multiplied by the difference between the Minimum Annual Commitment for such year and the number of batches of product we actually purchased in such year, or the Minimum Shortfall Payment, except in the event that BioVectra was unable to deliver the number of batches ordered by us in such year. In the event of certain serious or extended failures by BioVectra to supply product in the quantities ordered by us in a given year, our Minimum Annual Commitment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be subject to reduction, and our obligation to make a Minimum Shortfall Payment for such year (and potentially one or more subsequent years) will be waived. We will have the right to reduce the Minimum Annual Commitments for the year 2026 and subsequent years by up to a specified maximum percentage per year. Further, if we are only able to obtain regulatory approval for products incorporating bentracimab in only one of the United States or Europe, we and BioVectra have agreed to discuss in good faith an amendment to the BioVectra Agreement to reflect decreased requirements for product and impacts to the supply price to reflect lower volume commitments.
The initial term of the BioVectra Agreement commences on the effective date of the BioVectra Agreement and continues until the tenth anniversary after the manufacturing process for the product is validated in accordance with the BioVectra Agreement, or Validation. The term of the BioVectra Agreement may be extended for additional one-year periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate the BioVectra Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the occurrence of certain events of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the BioVectra Agreement (i) in the event of certain regulatory compliance failures by BioVectra or any person employed or retained by it to perform services under the BioVectra Agreement, or (ii) subject to payment of a termination fee to BioVectra (the amount of which decreases over the term of the BioVectra Agreement from an initial maximum in the mid-teens of millions of dollars to zero), in the event we decide that it will not, or is unable to, pursue regulatory approval or commercialization of products incorporating bentracimab or in the event of termination of our license to the product from MedImmune Limited. We may also terminate the BioVectra Agreement without cause and without payment of a termination 
fee upon 24 months’ notice following the fifth anniversary of regulatory approval of a product incorporating bentracimab by either the FDA or the EMA.
Manufacturing
Our large molecule clinical product candidate bentracimab and our ELP preclinical and research and development pipeline candidates are currently manufactured using a microbial expression system. Our manufacturing utilizes a straight-forward E. coli fermentation process with a simple column chromatography-based purification process. Our small molecule candidate, PB6440 is manufactured through chemical synthesis. We believe that these manufacturing processes will enable our product candidates to be manufactured efficiently for clinical and commercial applications. We do not have any cGMP manufacturing facilities. Instead, we utilize third parties for the cGMP manufacture of our product candidates for clinical trials, and we intend to continue to use third parties in the near term for the future clinical development and, if they are approved, commercial manufacture of our drug products. Our contract manufacturers are FDA-inspected establishments that have a history of supplying products to the pharmaceutical industry in accordance with cGMP.
Bentracimab
Bentracimab bulk drug substance, provided to us pursuant to the MedImmune License, was filled and released for use in our initial clinical trials. The bentracimab drug substance was manufactured by Wacker, a third-party contract manufacturer, utilizing Wacker’s proprietary E. coli strain. We completed a technology transfer of our current manufacturing process for bentracimab from Wacker to BioVectra, another cGMP manufacturer, and have engaged BioVectra to manufacture drug substance for our ongoing clinical trials and to manufacture commercial supply of bentracimab following regulatory approval, if obtained.
ELP Preclinical Pipeline
To date, we have relied on a non-proprietary E. coli strain for the production of our preclinical ELP pipeline candidates. Third-party manufacturers have performed the cGMP manufacturing of the drug product. Due to efficiencies achieved to date, we intend to utilize this non-proprietary strain for future manufacturing. As we advance preclinical product candidates through development, we intend to establish additional supply agreements and/or technology transfer agreements in order to meet our expected needs for future clinical trials and potential commercial demand.
PB6440
PB6440 is a small molecule candidate manufactured through chemical synthesis. Third-party manufacturers will perform the cGMP manufacturing of the drug. As we advance PB6440 through development, we intend to establish additional supply agreements and/or technology transfer agreements in order to meet our expected needs for future clinical trials and potential commercial demand.
Sales and Marketing
Except for the for the rights we granted to Alfasigma for bentracimab, we retain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates. Given our stage of development, we are in the process of building our commercial organization and distribution capabilities. We intend to commercialize bentracimab, if approved, independently in the United States because we believe the patient populations and medical specialists for these indications are sufficiently concentrated to allow us to effectively promote these products with a targeted sales team. We may explore, and selectively pursue, strategic collaborations or partnerships with third parties to commercialize any other future approved products both in and outside of the United States in order to maximize the commercial potential of our products.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
Our current and potential future competitors have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more 
successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our drug candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
Bentracimab
There are currently no other known reversal agents approved or in clinical development for ticagrelor or any other antiplatelet drugs. In the European Union, an extracorporeal whole blood purification adsorber device is available that may be useful for non-specific removal of ticagrelor during some cardiac procedures when used in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass. The maker of the device, CytoSorbent Corporation, has also initiated a clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the use of the DrugSorb-ATR antithrombotic removal system during cardiothoracic surgery. Upon approval, bentracimab would be the only therapeutic agent available for specific reversal of ticagrelor. As a result, market acceptance of bentracimab, if approved, will depend heavily on the continued market acceptance and use of ticagrelor. Ticagrelor competes against other commercially available antiplatelet therapies, including other P2Y12 receptor antagonists, many of which are available as generic drugs and are therefore currently significantly less expensive than ticagrelor. New antiplatelet therapies may also be developed in the future, including other reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonists and other antiplatelet therapies, which could also have reversal agents, that could displace ticagrelor as the preferred antiplatelet agent for ACS.
PB6440
    Although we anticipate that PB6440 may be used as a complement to patients’ existing antihypertensive therapies, we expect to compete with existing generic treatments for hypertension that target the mineralocorticoid receptor. In addition to the currently approved mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, eplerenone and spironolactone, we are also aware of a number of therapies in clinical development for the treatment of resistant hypertension with which PB6440 would compete if approved, including:
•Aprocitentan, orally active dual endothelin receptor antagonist that is being developed by Janssen Biotech;
•Firibastat, a selective and specific inhibitor of Aminopeptidase A being developed by Quantum Genomics;
•CIN-107, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor being developed by Cincor Pharmaceuticals;
•MLS-101, and aldosterone synthase inhibitor being studied by Mineralys Therapeutics; and
•BI 690517, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor being studied by Boehringer Ingelheim.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for bentracimab, PB6440 and future product candidates and related discoveries and our ELP technology; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our ELP technology, our product candidates and other proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
The term of individual patents varies depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of the delay by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in issuing the patent. In addition, a patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the patent term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period of the drug covered by the patent. The patent term extension based upon delay by the FDA can be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and the extension may only apply to one patent that covers the approved drug (and to only those patent claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it). There can be no assurance that any such patent term adjustment or extension will be obtained. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically in countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-
provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
As of December 31, 2021, our patent estate contained at least 22 patent families that we own or in-license that protect various aspects of our ELP technology or our product candidates. We own or have rights in 26 United States patents, 16 United States patent applications, 135 foreign patents and 75 foreign patent applications.
Bentracimab
With regard to bentracimab, we in-licensed one patent family. As of December 31, 2021, this patent family included two issued United States patents with composition of matter claims covering bentracimab that are expected to expire in 2035 and 2036, without taking patent term extensions into account, three pending United States patent applications, two issued foreign patents, and 13 pending foreign applications, that if issued, would expire in 2035. 
PB6440
Upon acquiring the intellectual property rights of PB6440 in January 2020, we acquired three patent families relating to aldosterone synthase inhibitors, which as of December 31, 2021 consisted of three granted patents in the United States, two pending applications in the United States and 15 pending foreign applications. The granted United States patents are expected to expire in 2037, without taking patent term extensions into account.
ELP Technology
As of December 31, 2021, we owned two patent families relating to our ELP technology, which consist of two granted patents in the United States, two pending applications in the United States and ten pending foreign applications. The first granted patent is expected to expire in 2021 and the second is expected to expire in 2035, without taking patent term extensions into account.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some trials also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product or, for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require 
one or more Phase 4 post-marketing studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Accelerated Approval Program
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For biologic products, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
To qualify for the Breakthrough Therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on certain health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates, independent contractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, as well as their 
covered subcontractors. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; as well as state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
We are also subject to additional federal laws, such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits, any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers would be subject to regulation under the FCPA. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Market acceptance and sales of any drug products depend in part on coverage and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for drug products will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and other private health insurers. Coverage and reimbursement for our product also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using bentracimab as a ticagrelor reversal agent. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which our product is used may not be available. Even if the procedure using our product is covered, third-party payors may package the cost of the drug into the procedure payment and not separately reimburse the physician for the costs associated with our product. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover or separately reimburse for our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Additionally, in the United States, there is no 
uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided is made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement.
Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement.
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational.
Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our product candidates, to the extent that customers who are prescribed our product candidates, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is completed on an annual basis. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula and introduced a merit-based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program. This program provides clinicians with two ways to participate, including through the Advanced Alternative Payment Models, or APMs, and the Merit-based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS. In November 2019, CMS issued a final rule finalizing the changes to the Quality Payment Program. The full impact to overall physician reimbursement as a result of the introduction of the Quality Payment Program remains unclear. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates.
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, contains a number of provisions of particular importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including 
among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief legislation has temporarily suspended these reductions from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Congress is also considering drug pricing as part of other health reform initiatives. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
