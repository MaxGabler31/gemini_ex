Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Anixa Biosciences, Inc. is a biotechnology company developing therapies and vaccines that are focused on critical unmet needs in oncology and infectious disease. Our therapeutics programs include (i) the development of a chimeric endocrine receptor T-cell therapy, a novel form of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) technology, initially focused on treating ovarian cancer, which is being developed at our subsidiary, Certainty Therapeutics, Inc. (“Certainty”), and (ii) the discovery and ultimately development of anti-viral drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 focused on inhibiting certain protein functions of the virus. Our vaccine programs include (i) the development of a preventative vaccine against triple negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), the most lethal form of breast cancer, as well other forms of breast cancer and (ii) a preventative vaccine against ovarian cancer.
 
Our subsidiary, Certainty, is developing immuno-therapy drugs against cancer. Certainty holds an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by The Wistar Institute (“Wistar”), the nation’s first independent biomedical research institute and a leading National Cancer Institute designated cancer research center, relating to Wistar’s chimeric endocrine receptor targeted therapy technology. We have initially focused on the development of a treatment for ovarian cancer, but we also may pursue applications of the technology for the development of treatments for additional solid tumors. The license agreement requires Certainty to make certain cash and equity payments to Wistar upon achievement of specific development milestones. With respect to Certainty’s equity obligations to Wistar, Certainty issued to Wistar shares of its common stock equal to five percent (5%) of the common stock of Certainty.

Certainty, in collaboration with the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Inc. (“Moffitt”), is advancing toward human clinical testing the CAR-T technology licensed by Certainty from Wistar aimed initially at treating ovarian cancer. We submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in March 2021 and in August 2021, we received authorization from the FDA to commence enrollment and treatment of patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. We are performing the activities necessary to prepare for treatment of patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial, and we anticipate treating the first enrolled patient in the first calendar quarter of 2022. This study is a dose-escalation trial with two arms based on injection method—intraperitoneal or intravenous—to determine the maximum tolerated dose in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer and to assess persistence, expansion and efficacy of the modified T-cells. The study is being conducted at Moffitt and will consist of 24 to 48 patients who have received at least two prior lines of chemotherapy. The study is estimated to be completed in two to four years depending on multiple factors including when maximum tolerated dose is reached and the rate of patient recruitment.
 
In April 2020, we entered into a collaboration with OntoChem GmbH (“OntoChem”) to discover and ultimately develop anti-viral drug candidates against COVID-19. Through this collaboration, we utilized advanced computational methods, machine learning, and molecular modeling techniques to perform in silico screening of over 1.2 billion compounds in chemical libraries (including publicly available compounds and OntoChem’s proprietary libraries) to evaluate if any of these compounds could disrupt one of two key enzymes of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19.
 
The screening process resulted in the identification of multiple compounds that could potentially disrupt critical enzymes of the virus. Several of these compounds were synthesized and tested in in vitro biological assays. Upon completion of these biological assays, we identified two of the most promising compounds and tested them in animal models. In these animal studies, the two compounds were compared to Remdesivir, which at the time the assays were performed was the only anti-viral drug authorized by the FDA for COVID-19. The data showed that administration of the drugs to infected hamsters did not cause any noticeable adverse effects, and monitoring of weight and general animal behavior demonstrated comparable efficacy between each of our compounds and Remdesivir. Based on this promising data in the animal study, we directed our team to proceed to the next stage of drug development and we selected one of the compounds around which our team are performing combinatorial synthetic medicinal chemistry to evaluate whether potency can be increased and pharmacokinetics optimized.
 
In May 2021, after completion of the aforementioned animal studies, OntoChem assigned its rights and obligations related to this collaboration to MolGenie GmbH (“MolGenie”), a company spun-out from OntoChem focused on drug discovery and development. As a result of the MolGenie spin-out, there was no change in the personnel working on our project, and the assignment caused no interruptions to the program’s development.
 
While use of preventative vaccines is widespread throughout much of the developed world, we believe that there is and will continue to be a need for effective treatments for COVID-19. There are a number of factors that have limited the effectiveness, both in the near and long term, of the vaccines currently in use, including, but not limited to, vaccine persistence, viral escape and perceptions of long-term safety resulting in vaccine resistance. Furthermore, there are currently two new anti-viral treatments, Pfizer’s Paxlovid, which is a combination therapy consisting of the protease-inhibitor nirmatrelvir and the antiretroviral ritonavir and Merck’s polymerase-inhibitor molnupiravir, that have recently been authorized for emergency use in the U.S. These treatments use oral formulations, while all other currently authorized or approved treatments require administration in a hospital setting. As the main component of Pfizer’s treatment is a protease-inhibitor, it is most similar to our compounds, and we therefore anticipate similar or better efficacy with our compounds. Whereas Pfizer’s nirmatrelvir was based on research done on rhinoviruses and not designed specifically for SARS-CoV-2, our compounds were designed specifically against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and at the current time we do not anticipate the need for a combination therapy.

We hold an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (“Cleveland Clinic”) relating to a certain breast cancer vaccine technology developed at Cleveland Clinic. Utilizing this technology, we are working in collaboration with Cleveland Clinic to develop a method to vaccinate women against contracting breast cancer, focused specifically on TNBC. The focus of this vaccine is a specific protein, α-lactalbumin, that is only expressed during lactation in a healthy mother’s mammary tissue. This protein disappears when the mother is no longer lactating, but reappears in many forms of breast cancer, especially TNBC. Studies have shown that vaccinating against this protein prevents breast cancer in mice.
 
Following submission of an IND application with the FDA in November 2020, and the FDA’s subsequent authorization to proceed with clinical trials in December 2020, in October 2021, we commenced dosing patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial of our breast cancer vaccine. Funded by a U.S. Department of Defense grant, this study is a multiple-ascending dose Phase 1 trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the vaccine in patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as well as monitor immune response. The study is being conducted at Cleveland Clinic and will consist of 18 to 24 patients who have completed treatment for early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer within the past three years and are currently tumor-free but at high risk for recurrence. During the course of the study, participants will receive three vaccinations, each two weeks apart, and will be closely monitored for side effects and immune response. The study is estimated to be completed in the third calendar quarter of 2022.
 
In November 2020, we executed a license agreement with Cleveland Clinic pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Cleveland Clinic relating to certain ovarian cancer vaccine technology. This technology pertains to among other things, the use of vaccines for the treatment or prevention of ovarian cancers which express the anti-Mullerian hormone receptor 2 protein containing an extracellular domain (“AMHR2-ED”). In healthy tissue, this protein regulates growth and development of egg-containing follicles in the ovary. While expression of AMHR2-ED naturally and markedly declines after menopause, this protein is expressed at high levels in the ovaries of postmenopausal women with ovarian cancer. Researchers at Cleveland Clinic believe that a vaccine targeting AMHR2-ED could prevent the occurrence of ovarian cancer. We entered into a joint development agreement with Cleveland Clinic to advance this vaccine toward human clinical testing.
 
In May 2021, Cleveland Clinic was granted an award for our ovarian cancer vaccine technology by the National Cancer Institute’s (“NCI”) PREVENT program. The NCI is a part of the National Institutes of Health. The PREVENT program is a peer-reviewed agent development program designed to support preclinical development of innovative interventions and biomarkers for cancer prevention and interception towards clinical trials. The scientific and financial resources of the PREVENT program will be used for our ovarian cancer vaccine technology to perform virtually all pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and IND-enabling studies. This work will be performed at NCI facilities, by NCI scientific staff and with NCI financial resources and will require no material financial expenditures by the Company, nor the transfer of any rights to the Company’s assets.
 
In July 2020, we implemented a strategic realignment of our business and redirected resources to exclusively focus on the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Accordingly, we suspended operations of our subsidiary, Anixa Diagnostics Corporation, and the development of the Cchek™ artificial intelligence driven platform of non-invasive blood tests for the early detection of cancer.

Over the next several quarters, we expect the development of our breast and ovarian cancer vaccines, our COVID-19 therapeutic discovery program and Certainty’s CAR-T technology to be the primary focus of the Company. As part of our legacy operations, the Company remains engaged in limited patent licensing activities regarding the Cchek™ liquid biopsy platform, as well as in the area of encrypted audio/video conference calling. We do not expect these activities to be a significant part of the Company’s ongoing operations nor do we expect these activities to require material financial resources or attention of senior management.
 
Over the past several years, our revenue was derived from technology licensing and the sale of patented technologies, including revenue from the settlement of litigation. We have not generated any revenue to date from our therapeutics or vaccine programs. In addition, while we pursue our therapeutics and vaccine programs, we may also make investments in and form new companies to develop additional emerging technologies. We do not expect to begin generating revenue with respect to any of our current therapy or vaccine programs in the near term. We hope to achieve a profitable outcome by eventually licensing our technologies to large pharmaceutical companies that have the resources and infrastructure in place to manufacture, market and sell our technologies as therapeutics or vaccines. The eventual licensing of any of our technologies may take several years, if it is to occur at all, and may depend on positive results from human clinical trials.
 
CAR-T therapeutics
 
Certainty was formed to develop immuno-therapy drugs against cancer, and in November 2017, we entered into a license with Wistar whereby we obtained rights to certain intellectual property surrounding Wistar’s chimeric endocrine receptor targeted therapy technology.
 
CAR-T therapeutics have demonstrated positive results in B-cell cancers, but very little progress has been made on solid tumors. Our CAR-T technology is initially focused on ovarian cancer and is based on engineering killer T-cells with the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (“FSH”) to target ovarian cells that express the FSH-Receptor. Data on this technology, including the animal studies showing efficacy, was published in January 2017 in the journal, Clinical Cancer Research. The FSH-Receptor has been shown to be a very exclusive protein found on a large percentage of ovarian cancer cells, but not on a significant number of non-ovarian healthy tissues in adult females.
 
Studies have shown that the FSH-Receptor is also expressed in endothelial cells of the vasculature of neoplasias. We anticipate performing further studies to evaluate the ability of our CAR-T to disrupt the vasculature of other cancers, after we commence clinical trials of this technology against ovarian cancer.
 
We have been working with researchers at Moffitt to complete the steps necessary to commence human clinical testing of our CAR-T therapy for patients suffering from ovarian cancer. Moffitt is one of the top cancer centers in the country with pre-clinical and clinical expertise with CAR-T technology. Moffitt has conducted many of the highest profile CAR-T trials in the world.
 
We performed numerous studies in preparation for the IND application. In those studies, several groups of tumor free, female mice were intra-peritoneally infused with increasing concentrations of the murine CAR-T construct and their health status was monitored for up to five months. The following summarizes the results of these studies:
 

● | No treated mice showed any signs of pain/stress, difficulty breathing or increased respiratory rate, reduced movement, reduced grooming or feeding, dehydration, anorexia or any other sign of distress. Control mice also did not show any distress. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The treated mice did not show any weight loss. Control mice also did not show any weight loss.

● | One cohort of treated mice also had blood drawn periodically for measurement of markers for liver function (AST-Aspartate transaminase/ALT-Alanine transaminase), kidney function (creatinine), and metabolic function (glucose). No abnormal values were observed, as was the case for control mice. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Serum IL-6 (interleukin-6) increased in the treated mice, as well as mice treated with control T-cells. This indicated that the T-cells were inducing the expected inflammatory response. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Histological analysis of the ovaries showed that 60% of the treated mice had significant reduction in ovarian mass, while the control mice exhibited no reduction. This observation confirms that the CAR-T was successfully attacking the ovaries, as we hoped and expected. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While these results are positive, there are many uncertainties in drug development, and most drugs fail to reach commercialization. In the future, we hope to achieve a profitable outcome by eventually licensing our technology to a large pharmaceutical company that has the resources and infrastructure in place to manufacture, market and sell our technology as a cancer treatment.
 
We anticipate beginning the human clinical trials in the first calendar quarter of 2022. This study is a dose-escalation trial with two arms based on injection method—intraperitoneal or intravenous—to determine the maximum tolerated dose in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer and to assess persistence, expansion and efficacy of the modified T-cells. The study is being conducted at Moffitt and will consist of 24 to 48 patients who have received at least two prior lines of chemotherapy. The study is estimated to be completed in two to four years depending on multiple factors including when maximum tolerated dose is reached and the rate of patient recruitment.
 
The Market
 
We believe that our CAR-T technology may be used as an effective treatment against multiple solid tumor types, however, we have initially focused on ovarian cancer. According to American Cancer Society statistics, ovarian cancer accounts for just 2% of all female cancer cases, but 5% of cancer deaths in women due to the disease’s low survival rate. It is estimated that in 2021, approximately 21,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,000 American women will die from this disease. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need, as the overall five-year relative survival rate for ovarian cancer patients is 49%. However, ovarian cancer survival varies substantially by age, with the overall five-year survival rate for women 65 and older of only 32%.
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary FSH-Receptor targeted immuno-therapy platform for treating solid tumors and scientific expertise in the field of cell therapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our program. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
COVID-19 therapeutics
 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (“SARS-CoV-2”). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and while in the majority of cases results in mild symptoms, in many cases the symptoms progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
 
There are currently few broadly available effective treatments. Further, most treatments that are currently being employed require administration in a hospital setting, thus continuing to overburden the healthcare system, and the orally-available treatments developed by Pfizer and Merck have only recently received authorization by the FDA. In addition, nearly all treatments currently in use or in clinical trials were originally developed for other indications, and were not designed specifically against SARS-CoV-2, and therefore may have limited effectiveness. We believe that newly designed drugs that are purposefully developed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2, enabled by recent studies of the molecular biology of the virus, will have the potential to be far more effective than repurposing existing drugs.
 
In April 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with OntoChem, who subsequently assigned its rights and obligations under the collaboration agreement to MolGenie, for the purpose of discovering and ultimately developing anti-viral drug candidates for COVID-19. Our collaboration has primarily focused on the virus’ main protease (“Mpro”), which is an enzyme of the virus that severs a large poly-peptide into functional proteins that enable the virus to replicate in a human host. Our program has focused on identifying molecules that inhibit the function of this enzyme, and potentially stop or slow the virus’ ability to replicate and cause disease. Since this protease does not have human analogs, potential inhibitors may not affect any human proteins and therefore toxic side effects may be minimized.

Through our collaboration, we utilized advanced computational methods, machine learning and molecular modeling techniques to perform in silico screening of over 1.2 billion compounds in OntoChem’s chemistry and gene ontology database (including publicly available compounds and OntoChem’s proprietary libraries) to evaluate if any of these compounds could disrupt Mpro and to evaluate the molecules’ potential side effects, as well as their drug-like characteristics. This screening process resulted in identifying a large number of compounds that could potentially be safe and effective against COVID-19.
 
The screening process resulted in the identification of multiple compounds that could potentially disrupt critical enzymes of the virus. Several of these compounds were synthesized and tested in in vitro biological assays. Upon completion of these biological assays, we identified two of the most promising compounds and tested them in animal models. In these animal studies, the two compounds were compared to Remdesivir, which at the time the assays were performed was the only anti-viral drug authorized by the FDA for COVID-19. The data showed that administration of the drugs to infected hamsters did not cause any noticeable adverse effects, and monitoring of weight and general animal behavior demonstrated comparable efficacy between each of our compounds and Remdesivir. Based on this promising data in the animal study, we directed our team at OntoChem to proceed to the next stage of drug development and we selected one of the compounds around which OntoChem and other third-party service providers are performing combinatorial synthetic medicinal chemistry to evaluate whether potency can be increased and pharmacokinetics optimized.
 
As SARS-CoV-2 has continued to mutate over the course of the pandemic, we have performed genomic variant analysis to determine whether our compounds may be effective against new variants as they have arisen. To date, the results of such analyses have shown that either no significant mutations have been found in or near the active site of the Mpro enzyme or any known mutations do not change the function of the enzyme, and therefore we believe that our compounds should be effective against the Delta variant, as well as the newly identified Omicron variant, which has become the most common form of the virus circulating in the U.S., though there is no assurance that this will be the case.


The Market
 
According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) data, as of the date of this Report, in the U.S., there have been nearly 54 million cases of COVID-19 and over 820,000 deaths. According to World Health Organization (“WHO”) data, globally, there have been over 280 million cases and over 5.4 million people have died.


Currently, there are few broadly available effective treatments for COVID-19. Further, the most common treatments that are currently being employed, such as Remdesivir and various steroid and antibody treatments, are all in-patient therapeutics and require hospitalization, adding to the burden on the healthcare system. We believe that a better approach, which we are employing, would be a therapeutic that can be formulated as a pill and taken as soon as there is a positive test for COVID-19. While two orally-available anti-viral treatments developed by Pfizer and Merck have recently been authorized for emergency use by the FDA, both have limitations as Pfizer’s treatment requires a combination therapy with an antiretroviral drug commonly used to treat HIV and the Merck treatment has shown limited efficacy.
 
The market for orally delivered COVID-19 treatments that would dramatically reduce hospitalization rates would be significant, especially if such treatments were effective against multiple variants of the virus.

Competition
 
Competition in the COVID-19 treatment and prevention market is fierce, with hundreds of therapies and vaccines currently in development. There are currently a number of preventative vaccines that have received regulatory approvals globally. While these vaccines have been effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, there remain challenges regarding persistence and viral escape as well as the resistance to vaccination by a significant portion of the population and also the difficulty in vaccinating and boosting the world population. Further, there are currently two new orally-available anti-viral treatments, the combination protease-inhibitor-antiretroviral Paxlovid developed by Pfizer and the polymerase-inhibitor molnupiravir developed by Merck, that have recently been authorized for emergency use in the U.S. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and vaccines and new therapies and vaccines that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary compounds for treating COVID-19 and scientific expertise in the field of synthetic chemistry provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments.

Breast and Ovarian Cancer vaccines
 
We licensed certain technology from Cleveland Clinic to develop vaccines for the treatment or prevention of TNBC and other breast cancers which express the α-lactalbumin protein. This protein is only expressed during lactation in healthy women, but may also be expressed in individuals with certain breast cancers, most notably TNBC, the most lethal form of breast cancer. Further, we have licensed certain technology from Cleveland Clinic to develop vaccines for the treatment or prevention of ovarian cancers which express AMHR2-ED. This protein regulates growth and development of egg-containing follicles in the ovary and its expression naturally and markedly declines after menopause. However, AMHR2-ED is expressed at high levels in the ovaries of postmenopausal women with ovarian cancer.

Typically, vaccines harness the immune system to protect people from infectious diseases. Broad-based vaccination programs have essentially eliminated some of the most deadly and debilitating diseases in history, small pox and polio among them. However, there has been little success developing a preventative (prophylactic) vaccine against cancer.
 
Vaccines work by exposing a benign form of a disease agent to an individual’s immune system. The immune system identifies the agent and learns to attack and destroy it, retaining a memory of the agent so the immune system knows to react quickly if an individual is exposed to the disease agent months or years later.
 
Most vaccines attack pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. The immune system is better able to assail these agents because they come from outside the body. Cancer, however, is caused by aberrant cells that arise out of our resident cells, which can make it difficult for our immune system to find the diseased cells, especially as advancing age weakens our immune system. Once these aberrant cells gain critical mass, they become cancer.
 
Despite the lack of success with cancer vaccines, recently gained knowledge about the human immune system has led to the development, approval and commercialization of revolutionary immuno-therapy drugs. These drugs do not attack cancer directly, but rather modulate the immune system in ways that enable it to destroy or dramatically impair cancer cells.
 
The breast cancer vaccine technology licensed from Cleveland Clinic has identified a protein, alpha-lactalbumin, that is present in healthy breast tissue only when a woman is lactating and disappears when she stops nursing her child. Alpha-lactalbumin is never present on any other cell in the body. However, it does show up in many types of breast cancer, including TNBC, an aggressive and deadly form of the disease. By developing a vaccine that targets alpha-lactalbumin, we feel the immune system can destroy these breast cancer cells as they arise and ultimately prevent breast tumors from forming.
 
Cleveland Clinic researchers have demonstrated in animal studies that vaccination against alpha-lactalbumin completely prevented breast cancer in mice that were specifically bred to develop breast cancer. Data on this technology, including the animal studies showing efficacy, was published in March 2016 in the journal, Cancers.
 
The ovarian cancer vaccine technology licensed from Cleveland Clinic has identified the AMHR2-ED protein, the expression of which is involved in egg production in the ovaries and is no longer expressed after menopause. AMHR2-ED is not meaningfully present on any other cell in the body. However, it does appear in many cases of epithelial ovarian cancers, the most common type of ovarian cancer. By developing a vaccine that targets AMHR2-ED, we feel the immune system can destroy these ovarian cancer cells as they arise and ultimately prevent tumors from forming. Data on this technology, including animal studies showing efficacy, was published in November 2017 in the journal, Cancer Prevention Research.
 
While the data thus far for both of our cancer vaccines has been positive, there are many uncertainties in drug development, and most drugs fail to reach commercialization.
 
During 2021, we worked with researchers at Cleveland Clinic to advance the breast cancer vaccine technology toward human clinical testing, and in October 2021, began treating patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, in May 2021, we and our partners at Cleveland Clinic began working with the NCI who will perform all pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and IND-enabling studies to advance our ovarian cancer vaccine technology toward human clinical testing.

The Breast Cancer Market
 
According to American Cancer Society statistics, breast cancer accounts for 30% of all female cancer cases, and 15% of cancer deaths in women. It is estimated that in 2021, 282,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. and 44,000 women will die from this disease. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there has been little change in breast cancer incidence rate over the last ten years.
 
The market for prophylactic cancer vaccines is sizable—bigger in fact than the market for any type of cancer therapeutic. After all, doctors administer cancer drugs only after a patient has been diagnosed, while a prophylactic vaccine may be administered to all people who have a possibility of developing the disease.
 
While in the U.S., 282,000 women are estimated to be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, there are approximately 75 million women over the age of 40—the time in life when women face an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Worldwide, the number is dramatically larger.
 
The Ovarian Cancer Market
 
According to American Cancer Society statistics, ovarian cancer accounts for just 2% of all female cancer cases, but 5% of cancer deaths in women due to the disease’s low survival rate. It is estimated that in 2021, 21,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed and 14,000 American women will die from this disease. Despite continuous advances made in the field of cancer research every year, there remains a significant unmet medical need, as the overall five-year relative survival rate for ovarian cancer patients is 49%. However, ovarian cancer survival varies substantially by age, with the overall five-year survival rate for women 65 and older of only 32%.
 
The market for prophylactic cancer vaccines is sizable—bigger in fact than the market for any type of cancer therapeutic. While in the U.S., 21,000 women are estimated to be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, there are approximately 30 million women over the age of 60—the time in life when women face an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Worldwide, the number is dramatically larger.

Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approvals for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
Employees
 
As of October 31, 2021, we had five employees, four full-time and one part time, working for our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, we work with research teams at Moffitt, Cleveland Clinic, and MolGenie, as well as their subcontractors, to develop each of our projects.

● | Our current business model relies on strategic collaborations with commercial partners to provide the resources and infrastructure to manufacture and ultimately market and/or sell our technologies. We may have difficulty in timing the establishment of these partnerships to achieve the greatest economic benefit for the Company, or in establishing these partnerships at all. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have never generated any revenue from biotechnology and pharmaceutical product sales and our biotechnology and pharmaceutical products may never be profitable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The therapeutics and vaccines that we are developing are novel and present significant challenges to successfully reaching market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | While pre-clinical testing of our product candidates has been positive, we may experience unfavorable results and unforeseen delays once we commence human clinical trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are dependent on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to our Intellectual Property
 

● | We rely on licenses from Wistar for our CAR-T technology and Cleveland Clinic for our breast and ovarian cancer vaccine technologies, and if we lose any of these licenses we may be subjected to future litigation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risks Related to our Common Stock
 

● | The issuance or sale of shares in the future to raise money or for strategic purposes could reduce the market price of our common stock.

● | We have issued a significant number of securities pursuant to our incentive plans and may continue to do so in the future. The vesting and, if applicable, exercise of these securities and the sale of the shares of common stock issuable thereunder may dilute your percentage ownership interest and may also result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock.
