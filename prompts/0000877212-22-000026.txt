Item 1.Business
The Company
We are a global leader providing Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other workflow automation products and services. The Company’s solutions are proven to help our customers and end-users digitize and automate their workflows to achieve their critical business objectives, including improved productivity and operational efficiency, optimized regulatory compliance, and better customer experiences. 
We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of AIDC products, including: mobile computers, barcode scanners and imagers, RFID readers, specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems (“RTLS”), related accessories and supplies, such as labels and other consumables, and related software applications. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services, as well as cloud-based software subscriptions and robotics automation solutions. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and other industries. We provide 
our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force and extensive network of over 10,000 channel partners, operating in approximately 180 countries, with 128 facilities and approximately 9,800 employees worldwide.
Through continual innovation of our technologies, we are leading an evolution of the traditional AIDC market into EAI, which encompasses solutions that sense key operational information such as packages moving through a supply chain, equipment in a factory, workers and robots in a warehouse, shoppers in a store, and patients in a hospital. Data from enterprise assets, including status, condition, location, utilization, and preferences, is then analyzed to provide prioritized actionable insights. Finally, with the benefits of cloud computing and connectivity, these insights and directives can be delivered to the right user at the right time to drive the best next action. As a result, our solutions enable enterprises to “sense, analyze, and act” more effectively throughout their workflows.
The evolution of the AIDC market to transform workflows is being driven by strong underlying secular trends in technology, which include the internet of things (“IoT”), cloud-based data analytics, intelligent automation, mobility, computer vision, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning. The IoT enables the real-time exchange of an increasingly broad set of information among a proliferation of smart, connected devices. Cloud computing and expanded data analytics are allowing enterprises to make better business decisions through improved timeliness and increased visibility into workflows. While traditional AIDC solutions sporadically capture limited amounts of data and populate static enterprise systems, newer solutions that can leverage artificial intelligence through machine learning can analyze real-time data from many sources to generate actionable insights. The continued rapid growth of mobile devices and application software are also significantly expanding mobile computing use cases throughout enterprises and supply chains. With these expanded capabilities, end-users can consume and act upon dynamic enterprise data and information anytime and anywhere. Additionally, computer vision (including machine vision) technology, which enables the automatic extraction and understanding of useful information from a digital image or video, provides a key element in many of our solutions.

Regulatory Matters
Wireless Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to certain wireless regulatory matters. The use of wireless voice, data, and video communications systems requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies, these include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios, and portable or hand-held devices. Consequently, our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time-to-time by the FCC, NTIA, or regulatory agencies in other countries. Our products operate both on the licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities, and consequently, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.
Other Regulatory Matters
Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites.
