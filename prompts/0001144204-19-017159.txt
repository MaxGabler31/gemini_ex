Overview
 
InsPro Technologies Corporation (“InsPro Technologies”, “we”, “our”) is a technology company that provides InsPro EnterpriseTM, which is a software application, used by insurance companies and administrators in the insurance industry.
 
We acquired Atiam Technologies, L.P. on October 1, 2007. HBDC Acquisition, LLC, which changed its name to InsPro Technologies, LLC (“InsPro LLC”) on May 14, 2009, develops, sells and supports our InsPro Enterprise software application. InsPro Enterprise is a comprehensive, web-based insurance administration software application, which was introduced by Atiam Technologies, L.P. in 2004. InsPro Enterprise clients include insurance carriers and third party administrators. We market InsPro Enterprise as a licensed software application, and we realize revenue from the sale of the software licenses, application service provider fees, software maintenance fees and consulting and implementation services.
 
During 2005 through October 1, 2007 our operations were primarily that of our former Telesales business, which we effectively sold in 2009.
 
InsPro Enterprise
 
Product Evolution and Development
 
InsPro LLC, and its predecessor, Systems Consulting Associates, Inc.(“SCA”), was founded in 1986 by Robert J. Oakes as a programming and consulting services company. In 1988, SCA entered into a long-term contract with Provident Mutual Insurance Company to develop, maintain, install, support and enhance IMACS, which was an insurance direct marketing and administration software system. IMACS was the precursor to InsPro Enterprise. InsPro Technologies dedicated four years, from 2001 to 2005, to developing its principal product, the initial version of InsPro Enterprise, which is a comprehensive, scalable and modular web-based insurance marketing, claims administration and policy servicing platform.
Product and Services 
 
We offer both a licensed and an application service provider (“ASP”) use of InsPro Enterprise, which is used for insurance administration and marketing for group and individual insurance business lines. InsPro Enterprise efficiently processes agent, direct market, worksite and web site generated business.
 
During 2018, we earned $21,634,355 in revenue of which 33% was earned from Trustmark Insurance Company, 17% earned from various subsidiaries of Cap Gemini S.A and 14% from Physicians Mutual Insurance Company.
 
InsPro Enterprise incorporates a modular design, which enables the customer to purchase only the functionality needed, thus minimizing the customer’s implementation cost and time necessary to implement InsPro Enterprise. InsPro Enterprise can be tailored to the requirements of a wide range of customers from the largest insurance companies and marketing organizations to small third party administrators, operating in environments ranging from a single server environment to mainframe installations. InsPro Enterprise currently supports a wide range of insurance distribution channels, including the Internet, traditional direct marketing, agent-generated, individual and group plans, worksite and association-booked business, and supports underwritten as well as guaranteed issue insurance products including long term care, Medicare supplement, critical illness, long and short term disability, whole and term life, comprehensive major, hospital indemnity and accidental death and dismemberment.

An InsPro EnterpriseTM software license entitles the purchaser a perpetual license to a copy of the InsPro Enterprise software installed at a single client location, which may be used to drive a production and model office instance of the application. The ASP Hosting Service enables a client to lease InsPro Enterprise, paying only for that capacity required to support its business. ASP hosting clients access an instance of InsPro Enterprise installed on our servers located at a third party’s site. The ASP Hosting Service can also enable a client to outsource its application management of its perpetually licensed InsPro Enterprise software to InsPro Technologies.
 
Software maintenance fees apply to both licensed and ASP clients. Maintenance fees cover periodic updates to the application and the InsPro Enterprise Help Desk.
 
Consulting and implementation services are generally associated with the implementation of an InsPro Enterprise instance for either an ASP or licensed client, and cover such activity as InsPro Enterprise installation, configuration, modification of InsPro Enterprise functionality, client insurance plan set-up, client insurance document design and system documentation.
 
InsPro Enterprise software agreements with our clients often involve multiple elements. We allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value or the residual method, as applicable using vendor specific objective evidence to determine fair value, which is based on prices charged when the element is sold separately. Software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software is delivered in accordance with all terms and conditions of the customer contracts, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable. Maintenance revenue, which pertains to post-contract customer support, including technical support and unspecified when-and-if available software upgrades, is recognized ratably over the maintenance agreement term. If fair value does not exist for any undelivered element, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of (i) delivery of such element or (ii) when fair value of the undelivered element is established, unless the undelivered element is a service, in which case revenue is recognized as the service is performed once the service is the only undelivered element.
 
Sales, Marketing and Operations
 
InsPro Technologies markets its products and services directly to prospective insurance carriers and third party administrators via trade shows, advertising in industry publications and direct mail.
 
InsPro Technologies also provides professional services to its clients, which include system implementation, legacy system migration to InsPro Enterprise, InsPro Enterprise application management, web development, InsPro Enterprise help desk and hosting service support.
 
InsPro Technologies utilizes several outside IT consulting firms, who assist with InsPro Technologies’ implementation and post implementation services to our clients. Implementation services include assisting clients in setting up their insurance products in InsPro Enterprise, providing modifications to InsPro Enterprise’s functionality to support the client’s business, interfacing InsPro Enterprise with the client’s other systems, automation of client correspondence to their customers and data conversion from the client’s existing systems to InsPro Enterprise. Post implementation services include these same services to existing clients supporting their ongoing utilization of InsPro Enterprise.
 
Competition
 
The market for insurance policy administration systems and services is very competitive, rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and subject to technological change. Many of our competitors are more established than we are and have greater name recognition, a larger customer base and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than InsPro Technologies.

InsPro Technologies is focused on the group voluntary (workplace) life and health products, senior health, disability, affinity, long term care and association segments of the insurance industry. InsPro Technologies competes with companies such as Accenture (Accenture Life Insurance & Annuity Platform), Synnex Corporation (Concentrix/GIAS and Genelco Software Solutions), Computer Sciences Corporation (FutureFirst), EXLService Holdings (LifePro), Majesco, and Fiserv Inc. (ID3), as well as with such smaller enterprises as Management Data, Inc., Flexible Architecture, and Simplified Technology, which is a privately held company that provides Fast Insurance Components. To compete we use best practice technologies and methods incorporated into InsPro EnterpriseTM, which provides customers with a user-friendly, flexible, modular and cost-effective insurance administrative software system. InsPro Enterprise’s modular design, scalability and ASP hosting service option makes InsPro Enterprise a compelling insurance administrative system for clients ranging from small third party administrators to the largest insurance carriers.
