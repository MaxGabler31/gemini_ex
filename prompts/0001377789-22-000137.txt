Item 1. Business
Aviat Networks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a global supplier of microwave networking solutions, backed by an extensive suite of professional services and support. Aviat Networks, Inc. may be referred to as “the Company,” “AVNW,” “Aviat Networks,” “Aviat,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2006 to combine the businesses of Harris Corporation’s Microwave Communications Division (“MCD”) and Stratex Networks, Inc. (“Stratex”). On January 28, 2010, we changed our corporate name from Harris Stratex Networks, Inc. to Aviat Networks, Inc.
Our principal executive offices are located at 200 Parker Dr., Suite C100A, Austin, Texas 78728, and our telephone number is (408) 941-7100. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol AVNW. As of July 1, 2022, we had 712 employees compared with 687 employees as of July 2, 2021.
Overview and Description of the Business
We design, manufacture and sell a range of wireless networking products, solutions and services to two principal customer types. 
1.Communications Service Providers (“CSPs”): These include mobile and fixed telecommunications network operators, broadband and internet service providers and network operators which generate revenues from the communications services that they provide.
2.Private network operators: These are customers which do not resell communications services but build networks for reasons of economics, autonomy, and/or security to support a wide variety of mission critical performance applications. Examples include federal, state and local government agencies, transportation agencies, energy and utility companies, public safety agencies and broadcast network operators around the world. 
We sell products and services directly to our customers, and, to a lesser extent, agents and resellers.
Our products utilize microwave and millimeter wave technologies to create point to point wireless links for short, medium and long-distance interconnections. In addition to our wireless products, we also provide routers and a range of software tools and applications to enable deployment, monitoring, network management and optimization of our systems as well as to automate network design and procurement. We also source, qualify, supply and support third party equipment such as antennas, optical transmission equipment and other equipment necessary to build and deploy a complete telecommunications transmission network. We provide a full suite of professional services for planning, deployment, operations, optimization and maintenance of our customers’ networks.
Our wireless systems deliver urban, suburban, regional and country-wide communications links as the primary alternative to fiber optic, low earth orbit satellite and copper connections. Fiber optic connections are the primary alternative. In dense urban and suburban areas, short range wireless solutions are faster to deploy and lower cost per mile than new fiber deployments. In developing nations, fiber infrastructure is scarce and wireless systems are used for both long and short distance connections. Wireless systems also have advantages over optical fiber in areas with rugged terrain, and to provide connections over bodies of water such as between islands or to offshore oil and gas production platforms. Through the air wireless transmission is also inherently lower in latency than transmission through optical cables and can be leveraged in time sensitive networking applications. 
Revenue from our North America and international regions represented approximately 66% and 34% of our revenue in fiscal 2022, respectively, 67% and 33% of our revenue in fiscal 2021, respectively, and 64% and 36% of our revenue in fiscal 2020, respectively. Information about our revenue attributable to our geographic regions is set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in “Note 10. Segment and Geographic Information” of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Market Overview
We believe that future demand for microwave and millimeter wave transmission systems will be influenced by a number of factors across several market segments. 
Mobile/5G Networks
As mobile networks expand, add subscribers and increase the number of wirelessly connected devices, sensors and machines, they require ongoing investment in backhaul infrastructure. Whether mobile network operators choose to self-build this backhaul infrastructure or lease backhaul services from other network providers, the evolution of the network drives demand for transmission technologies such as microwave and millimeter wave wireless backhaul. Within this overall scope there are multiple individual drivers for investment in backhaul infrastructure.
•5G Deployments. Mobile Radio Access Network (“RAN”) technologies are evolving. With the evolution from 4G (HSPA+ and LTE) to 5G, technology is advancing and providing subscribers with higher speed access to the Internet, social media, and video streaming services. The rapid increases in data to be transported through the RAN and across the backhaul infrastructure drives requirements for higher data transport links necessitating upgrades to or replacement of the existing backhaul infrastructure.
•Subscriber Growth. Traffic on the backhaul infrastructure increases as the number of unique subscribers grows.
•Connected Devices. The number of devices such as smart phones and tablets connected to the mobile network is far greater than the number of unique subscribers and is continuing to grow as consumers adopt multiple mobile device types. There is also rapid growth in the number and type of wireless enabled sensors and machines being connected to the mobile network creating new revenue streams for network operators in healthcare, agriculture, transportation and education. As a result, the data traffic crossing the backhaul infrastructure continues to grow.
•IoT. The Internet of Things (“IoT”) brings the potential of massive deployment of wireless end points for sensing and reporting data and remotely controlling machines and devices. The increase of data volume drives investment in network infrastructure.
•Network Densification. RAN frequency spectrum is a limited resource and shared between all of the devices and users within the coverage area of each base station. Meeting the combined demand of increasing subscribers and devices will require the deployment of much higher densities of base stations with smaller and smaller range (small cells) each requiring interconnection and proportionally driving increased demand for wireless backhaul and or fronthaul solutions as the primary alternative to optical fiber connectivity.
•Geographic Coverage. Expanding the geographic area covered by a mobile network requires the deployment of additional cellular base station sites. Each additional base station site also needs to be connected to the core of the mobile network through expansion of the backhaul system.
•License Mandates. Mobile Operators are licensed telecommunications service providers. Licenses will typically mandate a minimum geographic footprint within a specific period of time and/or a minimum proportion of a national or regional population served. This can pace backhaul infrastructure investment and cause periodic spikes in demand.
Rural Broadband
•Middle Mile. Aviat transport equipment is used to deliver broadband connectivity to rural and suburban communities as an alternative to costly fiber. There are significant investments being made to improve rural household and enterprise connectivity and many of these investments target middle mile infrastructure builds. 
•Expansion of Offered Services. Internet service providers, especially those in emerging markets, now own and operate the most modern communications networks within their respective regions. These network assets can be further leveraged to provide high speed broadband services to fixed locations such as small, medium and large business enterprises, airports, hotels, hospitals, and educational institutions. Microwave and millimeter wave backhaul is ideally suited to providing high speed broadband connections to these end points due to the lack of fiber infrastructure.
Private Networks
In addition to mobile backhaul, we see demand for microwave technology in other vertical markets, including utility, public safety, financial institutions and broadcast. 
•Many utility companies around the world are actively investing in “Smart Grid” solutions and energy demand management, which drive the need for network modernization and increased capacity of networks.
•The investments in network modernization in the public safety market can significantly enhance the capabilities of security agencies. Improving border patrol effectiveness, enabling inter-operable emergency communications services for local or state police, providing access to timely information from centralized databases, or utilizing video and imaging devices at the scene of an incident requires a high bandwidth and reliable network. The mission critical nature of public safety and national security networks can require that these networks are built, operated and maintained independently of other network infrastructure. Microwave is well suited to this environment because it is a cost-effective alternative to fiber.
•Microwave technology can be used to engineer long distance and more direct connections than optical cable. Microwave signals also travel through the air much faster than light through glass and the combined effect of shorter distance and higher speed reduces latency, which is valued for trading applications in the financial industry. Our products have already been used to create low latency connections between major centers in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe and Asia and we see long-term interest in the creation of further low latency routes in various geographies around the world.
•Evolution to IP. Network Infrastructure capacity, efficiency and flexibility is greatly enhanced by transitioning from legacy SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) / SONET (synchronous optical network) / TDM (time division multiplexing) to IP (internet protocol) infrastructure. Our products offer integrated IP transport and routing functionality increasing the value they bring in the backhaul network. 
•The enhancement of border security and surveillance networks to counter terrorism and insurgency is aided by the use of wireless technologies including microwave backhaul.
These factors are combining to create a range of opportunities for continued investment in backhaul and transport networks favoring microwave and millimeter wave technologies. As we focus on executing future generations of our technology, our goal is to make wireless technology a viable choice for an ever-broadening range of network types.
Strategy
We are engaging with customers on the evolution of use cases and applications as 5G mobile and broadband networks edge closer to implementation and begin to factor more strongly in the vendor selection process. We are confident in our ability to address current and future 5G market needs.
We are focused on building a sustainable and profitable business with growth potential. We have invested in our people and processes to create a platform for operational excellence across sales, services, product development and supply chain areas while continuing to make investments in strengthening our product and services portfolio and expanding our reach into targeted market areas.
Our strategy has three main elements aligned to deliver a compelling Total Cost of Ownership (“TCO”) value proposition. The first is our portfolio of wireless transport products allowing our customers increased capacity and flexibility with a much better total cost solution. We are expanding the data-carrying capacity of our wireless products to address the increasing data demand in networks of all types. Further, energy consumption is emerging as a key component of TCO. Our research and development contemplates innovations in capacity, energy efficiency and overall TCO.
Second, to address the operational complexity of planning, deploying, owning and operating microwave networks, we are investing in a combination of software applications, tools and services where simplification, process automation and our unique expertise in wireless technology can make a significant difference for our customers and partners. 
Finally, Aviat is investing in e-commerce through our online platform, the “Aviat Store” and supporting supply chain capabilities. Aviat can better service customers buying through the Aviat Store with lower costs, faster lead times and a simpler purchasing experience. The Aviat Store, together with our supply chain, enables customers (including Tier 2 and mobile 5G operators) to purchase products as needed, thus avoiding lengthy and variable lead times that come with other vendor solutions and allowing those customers to lower warehousing costs, reduce obsolete equipment, and lower the cost of capital by paying only when equipment is needed.
We continue to develop our professional services portfolio as key to our long-term strategy and differentiation. We offer a portfolio of hosted expert services and we continue to offer training and accreditation programs for microwave and IP network design, deployment and maintenance.
We expect to continue to serve and expand upon our existing customer base and develop business with new customers. We intend to leverage our customer base, our longstanding presence in many countries, our distribution 
channels, our comprehensive product line, our superior customer service and our turnkey solution capability to continue to sell existing and new products and services to current and future customers.
Products and Solutions
Our product and solutions portfolio is key to building and maintaining our base of customers. We offer a comprehensive product and solutions portfolio that meets the needs of service providers and network operators and that addresses a broad range of applications, frequencies, capacities and network topologies. 
•Broad product and solution portfolio. We offer a comprehensive suite of wireless transmission systems for microwave and millimeter wave networking applications. These solutions utilize a wide range of transmission frequencies, ranging from 5 GHz to 90 GHz, and can deliver a wide range of transmission capacities, ranging up to 20 Gigabits per second (Gbps). The major product families included in these solutions are CTR 8000, WTM 4000 and AviatCloud. Our CTR 8000 platform is a range of routers purpose-built for transport applications, especially those that require high level of reliability and security. The newest addition to our product portfolio is the WTM 4000, the highest capacity microwave radio ever produced to date, and purpose built for software-defined networks (“SDN.”) SDN technology is an approach to networking management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient networking configuration to improve networking performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional networking management. We introduced multiple important variants to the WTM 4000 platform; WTM4100 & 4200 providing single and dual frequency microwave links with advanced XPIC and MIMO capabilities; WTM4500 for multi-channel aggregation of microwave channels in long distance applications; WTM4800 is the latest addition to address 5G network requirements and is capable of operating in the 80GHz E Band at up to 20Gbps capacity, with a unique Multi-Band capability which simultaneously uses microwave and E Band frequencies for maximum robustness. WTM 4800 is the only single box multi-band solution for lowest total cost of ownership deployments. To address the issues of operational complexity in our customers’ networks, AviatCloud is a platform with secure hosted software and services to automate networks and their operations.
•Low total cost of ownership. Our wireless-based solutions focus on achieving a low total cost of ownership, including savings on the combined costs of initial acquisition, installation and ongoing operation and maintenance. Our latest generation system designs reduce rack space requirements, require less power, are software-configurable to reduce spare parts requirements, and are simple to install, operate, upgrade and maintain. Our advanced wireless features also enable operators to save on related costs, including spectrum fees and tower rental fees.
•Futureproof network. Our solutions are designed to protect the network operator’s investment by incorporating software-configurable capacity upgrades and plug-in modules that provide a smooth migration path to Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS (multiprotocol label switching) and segment routing based networking, without the need for costly equipment substitutions and additions. Our products include key technologies we believe will be needed by operators for their network evolution to support new broadband services.
•Flexible, easily configurable products. We use flexible architectures with a high level of software configurable features. This design approach produces high-performance products with reusable components while at the same time allowing for a manufacturing strategy with a high degree of flexibility, improved cost and reduced time-to-market. The software features of our products offer our customers a greater degree of flexibility in installing, operating and maintaining their networks.
•Comprehensive network management. We offer a range of flexible network management solutions, from element management to enterprise-wide network management and service assurance that we can optimize to work with our wireless systems.
•Complete professional services. In addition to our product offerings, we provide network planning and design, site surveys and builds, systems integration, installation, maintenance, network monitoring, training, customer service and many other professional services. Our services cover the entire evaluation, purchase, deployment and operational cycle and enable us to be one of the few complete, turnkey solution providers in the industry.
Business Operations
Sales and Service
Our primary route to market is through our own direct sales, service and support organization. This provides us with the best opportunity to leverage our role as a technology specialist and differentiate ourselves from competitors. Our focus on key customers and geographies allows us to consistently achieve a high level of customer retention and repeat business. Our highest concentrations of sales and service resources are in the United States, Western and Southern Africa, the Philippines, and the European Union. We maintain a presence in a number of other countries, some of which are based in customer locations and include, but not limited to, Canada, Mexico, Kenya, India, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.
In addition to our direct channel to market, we have relationships with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators especially focused towards large and complex projects in national security and government-related applications. Our role in these relationships ranges from equipment supply only to being a sub-contractor for a portion of the project scope where we will supply equipment and a variety of design, deployment and maintenance services.
We also use indirect sales channels, including dealers, resellers and sales representatives, in the marketing and sale of some lines of products and equipment on a global basis. These independent representatives may buy for resale or, in some cases, solicit orders from commercial or governmental customers for direct sales by us. Prices to the ultimate customer in many instances may be recommended or established by the independent representative and may be above or below our list prices. These independent representatives generally receive a discount from our list prices and are free to set the final sales prices paid by the customer.
We have a direct online sales option through our online “Aviat Store.” The Aviat Store targets customers with a traditional high cost to serve via traditional channels. We provide online design tools for radio link planning and on-line ordering tools, which we fulfill directly from our Aviat Store with multiple options of product available for next day shipment. Shipments from Aviat Store commenced late in 2018. 
We have repair and service centers in the Philippines and the United States. We have customer service and support personnel who provide customers with training, installation, technical support, maintenance and other services on systems under contract. We install and maintain customer equipment directly, in some cases, and contract with third-party service providers in other cases.
The specific terms and conditions of our product warranties vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business. On direct sales, warranty periods generally start on the delivery date and continue for one to three years.
Manufacturing
Our global manufacturing strategy follows an outsourced manufacturing model using contract manufacturing partners in North America and Asia. Our strategy is based on balancing cost and supplier performance as well as taking into account qualification for localization requirements of certain market segments, such as the Buy American Act. 
In accordance with our global logistics requirements and customer geographic distribution, we are engaged with contract manufacturing partners in Asia and the United States. All manufacturing operations have been certified to International Standards Organization 9001, a recognized international quality standard. We have also been certified to the TL 9000 standard, a telecommunication industry-specific quality system standard.
Backlog
Our backlog was approximately $245 million at July 1, 2022 and $225 million at July 2, 2021 consisting primarily of contracts or purchase orders for both product and service deliveries and extended service warranties. Services include management’s initial estimate of the value of a customer’s commitment under a services contract. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a customer’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind down costs. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as backlog only to the extent of the new incremental value. We regularly review our backlog to ensure that our customers continue to honor their purchase commitments and have the financial means to purchase and deploy our products and services in accordance with the terms of their purchase contracts. Backlog 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidation, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.
We expect to substantially deliver against the backlog as of July 1, 2022 during fiscal 2023, but we cannot be assured that this will occur. Product orders in our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser without significant penalty as well as long-term projects that could take more than a year to complete. Accordingly, although useful for scheduling production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of sales for any future period because of the timing of orders, delivery intervals, customer and product mix and the possibility of changes in delivery schedules and additions or cancellations of orders. 
Customers
Although we have a large customer base, during any given fiscal year or quarter, a small number of customers may account for a significant portion of our revenue.
During fiscal 2022, Motorola accounted for 13% of our total revenue. Motorola integrates a wide variety of network and the revenue consists of more than 70 active projects. During fiscal 2021 and 2020 there were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 
Competition
The microwave and millimeter wave wireless networking business is a specialized segment of the telecommunications industry that is sensitive to technological advancements and is competitive. Our principal competitors include business units of large mobile and IP network infrastructure manufacturers such as Ericsson, Huawei, NEC Corporation and Nokia Corporation, as well as a number of smaller microwave specialist companies such as Ceragon Networks Ltd. and SIAE Microelectronica S.p.A. We also compete with fiber optic cable and low earth orbit satellites for networking connections.
Some of our larger competitors may have greater name recognition, broader product lines (some including non-wireless telecommunications equipment and managed services), a larger installed base of products and longer-standing customer relationships. They may from time to time leverage their extensive overall portfolios into completely outsourced and managed network offerings restricting opportunities for specialist suppliers. In addition, some competitors may offer seller financing, which can be a competitive advantage under certain economic climates.
Some of our larger competitors may also act as systems integrators through which we sometimes distribute and sell products and services to end users.
The smaller independent private and public specialist competitors typically leverage new technologies and low product costs but are generally less capable of offering a complete solution including professional services, especially in the North America and Africa regions which form the majority of our addressed market. 
We concentrate on market opportunities that we believe are compatible with our resources, overall technological capabilities and objectives. Principal competitive factors are cost-effectiveness, product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service, ability to meet delivery schedules and the effectiveness of dealers in international areas. We believe that the combination of our network and systems engineering support and service, global reach, technological innovation, agility and close collaborative relationships with our customers are the key competitive strengths for us. However, customers may still make decisions based primarily on factors such as price, financing terms and/or past or existing relationships, where it may be difficult for us to compete effectively or profitably.
Research and Development
We believe that our ability to enhance our current products, develop and introduce new products on a timely basis, maintain technological competitiveness and meet customer requirements is essential to our success. Accordingly, we allocate, and intend to continue to allocate, a significant portion of our resources to research and development efforts in key technology areas and innovation to differentiate our overall portfolio from our competition. The majority of such research and development resources will be focused on technologies in microwave and millimeter wave RF, digital signal processing, networking protocols and software applications.
Our research and development expenditures totaled $22.6 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in fiscal 2022, $21.8 million, or 7.9% of revenue, in fiscal 2021, and $19.3 million, or 8.1% of revenue, in fiscal 2020.
Research and development are primarily directed to the development of new products and to build technological capability. We are an industry innovator and intend to continue to focus significant resources on product development in an effort to maintain our competitiveness and support our entry into new markets. 
Our product development teams totaled 147 employees as of July 1, 2022, and were located primarily in New Zealand and Slovenia.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Because of our range of products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our facilities, we use numerous sources of raw materials needed for our operations and for our products, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics. We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors for a large number of components and subsystems and upon the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to customers’ requirements or regulatory restrictions and to meet performance and quality specifications and delivery schedules.
Our strategy for procuring raw material and supplies includes dual sourcing (where possible) on strategic assemblies and components. In general, we believe this reduces our risk with regard to the potential financial difficulties in our supply base. In some instances, we are dependent upon one or a few sources, either because of the specialized nature of a particular item or because of local content preference requirements pursuant to which we operate on a given project. Examples of sole or limited source categories include metal fabrications and castings, for which we own the tooling and therefore limit our supplier relationships, and ASIC’s and MMICs (types of integrated circuit used in manufacturing microwave radios), which we procure at volume discount from a single source. Our supply chain plan includes mitigation plans for alternative manufacturing sites which would also mitigate COVID-19 and other disruption risks.
Although we have been affected by performance issues of some of our suppliers and subcontractors, we have not been materially adversely affected by the inability to obtain raw materials or products. In general, any performance issues causing short-term material shortages are within the normal frequency and impact range currently experienced by high-tech manufacturing companies and are due primarily to the highly technical nature of many of our purchased components.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We consider our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, in the aggregate, to constitute an important asset. We own a portfolio of patents, trade secrets, know-how, confidential information, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property. As of July 1, 2022, we (collectively with our subsidiaries) own approximately 184 U.S. patents and 188 international patents and had 5 U.S. patent applications pending and 15 international patent applications pending. The United States Patent and Trademark Office and international equivalent bodies have not yet concluded substantive examination of our pending patent applications. Therefore, it is unclear what scope of additional patent coverage, if any, will eventually be provided as a result of those pending applications. Failure to obtain comprehensive patent coverage could impair our ability to prevent competitors from replicating some portions or all of our products. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The costs we pay or revenue we receive from such licenses may be dependent on certain factors, such as the market for such licenses and whether such licenses can be negotiated on commercially acceptable terms. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single patent, license or other intellectual property right. 
From time to time, we might engage in litigation to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend against claims of alleged infringement asserted by third parties. Any of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide competitive advantages. Additionally, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult, costly and time consuming. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming, and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated.
In addition, to protect our confidential information, including our trade secrets, we require our employees and contractors to sign confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers and appropriate customers to limit their access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
Although our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information, we believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless 
telecommunications industry, our innovative skills, technical expertise and ability to introduce new products on a timely basis is just as important in maintaining our competitive position as protecting our intellectual property . Trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent protections are important but must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, new product introductions and product enhancements. Although we have and will continue to implement protective measures and intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our facilities and operations, in common with those of our industry in general, are subject to numerous domestic and international laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, particularly with regard to wastes and emissions. We believe that we have complied with these requirements and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Based upon currently available information, we do not expect expenditures to protect the environment and to comply with current environmental laws and regulations over the next several years to have a material impact on our competitive or financial position but can give no assurance that such expenditures will not exceed current expectations. From time to time, we receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or equivalent state or international environmental agencies that we are a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which is commonly known as the Superfund Act, and equivalent laws. Such notices may assert potential liability for cleanup costs at various sites, which include sites owned by us, sites we previously owned and treatment or disposal sites not owned by us, allegedly containing hazardous substances attributable to us from past operations. We are not presently aware of any such liability that could be material to our business, financial condition or operating results, but due to the nature of our business and environmental risks, we cannot provide assurance that any such material liability will not arise in the future.
Electronic products are subject to environmental regulation in a number of jurisdictions. Equipment produced by us is subject to domestic and international requirements requiring end-of-life management and/or restricting materials in products delivered to customers. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations, where applicable, with respect to our existing products sold into such jurisdictions.
Radio communications are also subject to governmental regulation. Equipment produced by us is subject to domestic and international requirements to avoid interference among users of radio frequencies and to permit interconnection of telecommunications equipment. We believe that we have complied with such rules and regulations with respect to our existing products, and we intend to comply with such rules and regulations with respect to our future products. Reallocation of the frequency spectrum could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have a comprehensive policy and procedures in effect concerning conflict minerals compliance.
Employees
As of July 1, 2022, we had 712 employees, compared with 687 employees at the end of fiscal 2021, and 674 employees at the end of fiscal 2020. As of July 1, 2022, of the 712 employees, 636 were full-time employees with 258 located in the U.S. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union. In certain international subsidiaries, our employees are represented by workers’ councils or statutory labor unions. In general, we believe that our employee relations are good.
