 Company Overview
 
BitNile Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as Ault Global Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in September 2017 (sometimes referred to as “BitNile,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”). We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in, among others, the following operating businesses: commercial and defense solutions, commercial lending, data center operations, Bitcoin mining and advanced textile technology. Our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include Gresham Worldwide, Inc. (“GWW”), TurnOnGreen, Inc., formerly known as Coolisys Technologies Corp. (“TOGI”), TOG Technologies, Inc. (“TOG Technologies”), Digital Power Corporation (“Digital Power”), Gresham Power Electronics Ltd. (“Gresham Power”), Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (“Enertec”), Relec Electronics Ltd. (“Relec”), Digital Power Lending, LLC (“DP Lending”), Ault Alliance, Inc. (“Ault Alliance”), Ault Global Real Estate Equities, Inc. (“AGREE”) and BitNile, Inc. (“BNI”). We also have a controlling interest in Microphase Corporation (“Microphase”), BNI has a controlling interest in Alliance Cloud Services, LLC (“ACS”), and Ault Alliance has a significant investment in Avalanche International Corp. (“Avalanche” or “AVLP”).
 
BitNile was founded by Milton C. (Todd) Ault, III, its Executive Chairman, and is led by Mr. Ault, William B. Horne, its Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman, and Henry Nisser, its President and General Counsel. Together, they constitute the Executive Committee, which manages the day-to-day operations of the holding company. The Company’s long-term objective is to maximize per share intrinsic value. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for us by Mr. Ault and the Executive Committee. We have four reportable segments:
 

● | Ault Alliance digital learning, commercial lending and trading through DP Lending, real estate investing through AGREE, and textile treatment through Avalanche;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | BNI: Bitcoin mining operation and data center operations through ACS;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GWW: defense solutions with operations conducted by Microphase, Enertec, Gresham Power and Relec; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TOGI: commercial electronics solutions with operations conducted by Digital Power, and EV charging solutions through TOG Technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We operate as a holding company with operations conducted primarily through our subsidiaries. We conduct our activities in a manner so as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Generally, this means that we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business and that no more than 40% of our total assets will be invested in investment securities, as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. Pursuant to the Investment Company Act, companies such as our subsidiary DP Lending are excluded from the definition of an investment company since its business consists of making loans and industrial banking. We also maintain a considerable investment in Avalanche, which does business as MTIX International (“MTIX”).
 
Originally, we were primarily a solution-driven organization that designed, developed, manufactured and sold high-grade customized and flexible power system solutions for the medical, military, telecom and industrial markets. Currently, this business is conducted by Digital Power. Although we actively seek growth through acquisitions, we will also continue to focus on high-grade and custom product designs for the commercial, medical and military/defense markets, where customers demand high density, high efficiency and ruggedized products to meet the harshest and/or military mission critical operating conditions.
 
We have operations located in Europe through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Gresham Power and Relec, each of which is located in England. Gresham Power designs, manufactures and sells power products and system solutions mainly for the European marketplace, including power conversion, power distribution equipment, DC/AC (Direct Current/Active Current) inverters and UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) products. Our European defense business is specialized in the field of naval power distribution products. On November 30, 2020, we acquired Relec pursuant to a stock purchase, under which we paid approximately $4,000,000 with additional contingent cash payments up to approximately $665,000 based on Relec’s future financial performance. Relec specializes in AC/DC power supplies, DC-DC converters, displays and electromagnetic compatibility (“EMC”) filters.

We have operations based in Israel through our wholly owned subsidiary Enertec, which designs, develops, manufactures and maintains advanced end-to-end high technology electronic solutions for military, medical, telecommunications and industrial markets.
 
On November 30, 2016, we formed DP Lending, a wholly owned subsidiary. DP Lending provides commercial loans to companies throughout the U.S. to provide them with operating capital to finance the growth of their businesses. The loans range in duration from six months to three years, DP Lending loans made or arranged pursuant to a California Financing Law license (Lic.no. 60 DBO77905).
 
On June 2, 2017, we purchased 56.4% of the outstanding equity interests of Microphase. Microphase is a design-to-manufacture original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) industry leader delivering world-class radio frequency (“RF”) and microwave filters, diplexers, multiplexers, detectors, switch filters, integrated assemblies and detector logarithmic video amplifiers (“DLVAs”) to the military, aerospace and telecommunications industries. Microphase is headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut.
 
On January 7, 2020, we formed TOGI, a wholly owned subsidiary. TOGI operates its existing businesses in the customized and flexible power system solutions for the automotive, medical, military, telecom, commercial and industrial markets, other than the European markets, which are primarily served by Gresham Power. In April 2021, TOGI formed TOG Technologies as a Nevada corporation to provide flexible and scalable EV charging solutions with a portfolio of residential, commercial and ultra-fast charging products, and comprehensive charging management software and network services.
 
On December 31, 2017, Coolisys Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“CTI”), entered into a share purchase agreement with Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc. (“MICT”), a Delaware corporation, Enertec Management Ltd., an Israeli corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of MICT (“EML”), and Enertec, an Israeli corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of EML, pursuant to which CTI acquired Enertec. Enertec is Israel’s largest private manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the military market. On May 23, 2018, CTI completed its acquisition of Enertec. Effective as of December 30, 2021, CTI was merged with and into GWW as a result which upstream merger CTI ceased to exist.

Our Corporate Structure
 
On January 19, 2021, we changed our corporate name from DPW Holdings, Inc. to Ault Global Holdings, Inc. and, on December 13, 2021, we changed our corporate name from Ault Global Holdings, Inc. to BitNile Holdings, Inc. (together, the “Name Changes”). The Name Changes were each effected through a parent/subsidiary short form merger pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January 7, 2021 and December 1, 2021, respectively. Neither of the mergers nor the corresponding Name Changes affected the rights of our security holders. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol “NILE.” Existing stock certificates that reflect our prior corporate names continue to be valid. Certificates reflecting the new corporate name are issued as old stock certificates are tendered for exchange or transfer to our transfer agent.

Commencing in October 2019 and continuing through February 2022, we reorganized our corporate structure pursuant to a series of transactions by and among BitNile and its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries. The purpose of the reorganization was to align our various businesses by the products and services that constitute the majority of each subsidiaries’ revenues. As a result of the foregoing transactions, our streamlined corporate structure is currently as follows: 
 

Our Business Strategy
 
As principally a holding company, our business strategy is designed to increase stockholder value. Under this strategy, we are focused on managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to stockholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize stockholder value, such as activist trading. We anticipate returning value to stockholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
 
On October 7, 2019, we created an Executive Committee which is comprised of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. The Executive Committee meets on a daily basis to address the Company’s critical needs and provides a forum to approve transactions which are communicated to our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance on a bi-weekly basis by our Chief Executive Officer.

Our Executive Committee approves and manages our investment and trading strategy. The Executive Committee has decades of experience in financial, investing and securities transactions. Led by our Founder and Executive Chairman, Milton C. (Todd) Ault, III, we seek to find undervalued companies and disruptive technologies with a global impact. We use a traditional methodology for valuing securities that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. Upon making an investment, we often become actively involved in the companies we seek to acquire. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve stockholder value, to acquiring a controlling or sizable but non-controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business. Mr. Ault relies heavily on William B. Horne, our Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Henry Nisser, our President and General Counsel, to provide analysis and guidance on all acquisition targets and throughout the acquisition process.
 
From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our stockholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, transactions in their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings, mergers or spin-offs and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these and functionally equivalent programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our stockholders.
 
Our Executive Committee acts as the underwriting committee for DP Lending and approves all lending transactions. Under its business model, DP Lending generates revenue through origination fees charged to borrowers and interest generated from each loan. DP Lending may also generate income from appreciation of investments in marketable securities as well as any shares of common stock underlying convertible notes or warrants issued to DP Lending in any particular financing.
 
Over the recent past, we have provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of businesses in cryptocurrency mining, DeFi, defense/aerospace, industrial, telecommunications, medical and textiles. We have provided capital to subsidiaries as well as partner companies in which we have an equity interest or may be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support.
 
Our Subsidiaries and their Businesses
 
BitNile, Inc.
 
BNI conducts data center operations and Bitcoin mining through ACS.
 
Overview
 
BNI is a blockchain technology company focused on mining of Bitcoin, among other activities. We mine using purpose-built computers (or “miners”) to solve complex cryptographic algorithms (or “verify” or “solve” blocks) in the blockchain in exchange for rewards and fees denominated in the native token of that blockchain network.
 
We will evaluate each digital asset in our portfolio, or that we propose to acquire in the future (including by mining), to determine whether it would likely be considered a security under U.S. federal securities laws, in consultation with outside counsel, as applicable. We will base our analysis on relevant caselaw, applying the frameworks established by the U.S. Supreme Court and taking into consideration relevant guidance by the SEC and its staff. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Bitcoin Operations – Legal and Regulatory — A particular digital asset’s status as a ‘security’ in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and if a regulator disagrees with our characterization of a digital asset, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines and penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A determination that Bitcoin that we own or mine is a ‘security’ may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and our business.”
 
Since commencement of our mining operations in 2021 at the Facility, we have mined 45.7 Bitcoin for our own account through December 31, 2021. While we mine for cryptocurrency for sale in the ordinary course of business, we believe that cryptocurrency represents an attractive, appreciating investment opportunity, and as such we have historically held cryptocurrency assets that we do not otherwise sell to fund our operating expenses. On December 31, 2021, we held 46.75 Bitcoin valued at approximately $2.2 million based on prices as of such date. Our total revenue from mining operation was $3.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Our mining operations generated net income of $1.5 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our approximately 46.75 Bitcoins was $2.2 million, representing 0.4% of our total assets of $490.8 million as of such date.

Our Vision
 
Traditional finance has historically had poor customer service and a less than desirable user experience in mobile and web-based platforms, which opens the door to massive disruption through digital technologies. Additionally, central bank intervention in the financial markets has increasingly turned to money printing through quantitative easing, which increasingly dilutes the buying power of the global fiat currency market and leads the world to seek more scarce alternatives. The first phase of the digital transformation has been through the creation of blockchain-based digital assets. We believe the second phase of this transition will be take form in bridges being built between DeFi and traditional finance to help improve customer service and user experience in traditional finance.
 
We foresee a time when traditional banking is done in the palm of our hands in community-based, peer-to-peer transactions as opposed through financial intermediaries. This community-based, peer-to-peer network is otherwise known as DeFi. Although we do not believe DeFi will replace traditional finance in the near- to medium-term, we believe this transition will happen rapidly over the next 20 years as Millennials and Gen-Xers become the power class and the Baby Boomers retire. DeFi is a concept whereby traditional financial intermediaries are not required to process transactions. The proliferation of blockchain-based protocols will enable participants to offer novel financial products to banking customers. For instance, in a world where traditional finance provides savings account rates less than 1%, DeFi protocols can provide savings accounts with significantly higher yields. Traditional financial platforms are not currently designed to distribute these products to its customers. We believe that in the near-term integrating a traditional broker dealer could help facilitate the distribution of these decentralized finance protocols to a broad base of customers. While we recognize DeFi is in its infancy stage, we believe blockchain will be integral to its advancement. We recognize the uncertainties in DeFi and its effect on our economy both in the U.S. and globally, and acknowledge that this is a new evolving area that may not evolve as we anticipate and in which we may never be a material participant.
 
Cryptocurrency and Cryptocurrency Mining Overview
 
Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies Overview
 
Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset that function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and/or a store of value (i.e. a new form of digital money). Cryptocurrencies operate by means of blockchain technology, which generally uses open-source, peer-to-peer software to create a decentralized digital ledger that enables the secure use and transfer of digital assets. We believe cryptocurrencies and associated blockchain technologies have potential advantages over traditional payment systems, including: the tamper-resistant nature of blockchain networks; rapid-to-immediate settlement of transactions; lower fees; elimination of counterparty risk; protection from identify theft; broad accessibility; and a decentralized nature that enhances network security by reducing the likelihood of a “single point of failure.” Recently, cryptocurrencies have gained widespread mainstream attention and have begun to experience greater adoption by both retail and institutional investors and the broader financial markets. For example, Bitcoin’s aggregate market value exceeded $800 trillion in February 2022, $1 trillion in February 2021 compared to $160 billion in February 2020, based on Bitcoin prices quoted on major exchanges. As cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technologies more generally, have entered the mainstream, prices of digital assets have reached all-time highs and the broader ecosystem has continued to develop. While we expect the value of Bitcoin to remain volatile, we believe this increase in aggregate market value signals institutionalization and wider adoption of cryptocurrency.
 
Cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies that enable near instantaneous transfers. Transactions occur via an open source, cryptographic protocol platform which uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority. The online network hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the blockchain, and each cryptocurrency is associated with a source code that comprises the basis for the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the blockchain. In a cryptocurrency network, every peer has its own copy of the blockchain, which contains records of every historical transaction — effectively containing records of all account balances. Each account is identified solely by its unique public key (making it effectively anonymous) and is secured with its associated private key (kept secret, like a password). The combination of private and public cryptographic keys constitutes a secure digital identity in the form of a digital signature, providing strong control of ownership.

No single entity owns or operates the network. The infrastructure is collectively maintained by a decentralized public user base. As the network is decentralized, it does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of the currency units. Rather, the value is determined by market factors, supply and demand for the units, the prices being set in transfers by mutual agreement or barter among transacting parties, as well as the number of merchants that may accept the cryptocurrency. Since transfers do not require involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are currently little to no transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions. Units of cryptocurrency can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, at rates determined on various exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Kraken, Gemini, and others. Cryptocurrency prices are quoted on various exchanges and fluctuate with extreme volatility.
 
We believe cryptocurrencies offer many advantages over traditional, fiat currencies, although many of these factors also present potential disadvantages and may introduce additional risks, including:
 

● | acting as a fraud deterrent, as cryptocurrencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by a sender;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | immediate settlement;
--+----------------------


● | elimination of counterparty risk;
--+----------------------------------


● | no trusted intermediary required;
--+----------------------------------


● | lower fees;
--+------------


● | identity theft prevention;
--+---------------------------


● | accessible by everyone;
--+------------------------


● | transactions are verified and protected through a confirmation process, which prevents the problem of double spending;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | decentralized — no central authority (government or financial institution); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not recognized universally and not bound by government imposed or market exchange rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, cryptocurrencies may not provide all of the benefits they purport to offer.
 
Limitations on Bitcoin Mining
 
In addition to competition, there are two factors that may affect all digital asset mining companies and Bitcoin in particular: (i) limitations on the supply of the cryptocurrency being mined; and (ii) the market price of the cryptocurrency.
 
The blockchain’s method for creating new Bitcoins is mathematically determined in a manner so that the supply of Bitcoins grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. Specifically, the number of Bitcoins awarded for solving a new block is automatically halved for every 210,000 blocks that are solved. The current fixed reward for solving a new block is 6.25 Bitcoins per block, which was reduced from 12.5 Bitcoins in May 2020. This deliberately controlled rate of Bitcoin creation means that the number of Bitcoins in existence will never exceed 21 million and that Bitcoins cannot be devalued through excessive production unless the Bitcoin network’s source code and the underlying protocol for Bitcoin issuance is altered. This also means, however, that our revenue prospects will decline unless the price of a Bitcoin increases commensurately or we acquire more miners.
 
We currently only mine Bitcoin. Our ability to generate revenue from our mining operations will be dependent on the price of Bitcoin. On September 24, 2021, the Bank of China announced that all cryptocurrency trading and mining are illegal in China. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second largest digital currency, fell 5% and 7%, respectively. The prices of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, have experienced substantial volatility, including fluctuation patterns which may reflect “bubble” type volatility, meaning that high or low prices at a given time may not be indicative of the current or future value of Bitcoin. The price of a Bitcoin may be subject to rapidly changing investor and market sentiment, and may be influenced by factors such as technology, regulatory developments and media coverage. Further, Bitcoin’s value, like that of other cryptocurrencies, may be based on various factors, including their acceptance as a means of exchange or purchasing power by consumers and vendors, volume, liquidity and transferability and market demand. Bitcoin’s current price reflects, in part, the belief by some that Bitcoin could become a widely accepted form of currency, however if this prediction turns out to be incorrect its price could decrease dramatically, as would our prospects for future revenue and profits. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Bitcoin Operations” for more information on the risks we face due to our mining of Bitcoin and its speculative and volatile nature.

Cryptocurrency Mining and Mining Pools
 
As a cryptocurrency miner, we use specialized miners to solve cryptographic math problems necessary to record and “publish” cryptocurrency transactions to blockchain ledgers. Generally, each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain, which consists of software code (also known as a protocol), which is run by all the computers on the network for such blockchain. Within this code, transactions are collated into blocks, and these blocks must meet certain requirements to be verified by the blockchain software, added to the blockchain or ledger of all transactions and published to all participants on the network that are running the blockchain software. After a transaction is verified, it is combined with other transactions to create a new block of data for the blockchain. For proof-of-work blockchains, the process of verifying valid blocks requires computational effort to solve a cryptographic equation, and this computational effort protects the integrity of the blockchain ledger. This process is referred to as “mining.” As a reward for verifying a new block, miners receive payment in the form of the native cryptocurrency of the network (e.g., Bitcoin). This payment is comprised of a block reward (i.e., the automatic issue of new cryptocurrency tokens) and the aggregated transaction fees for the transactions included in the block (paid in existing cryptocurrency tokens by the participants to the transactions). The block reward payments and the aggregated transaction fees are what provide the incentive for miners to contribute hash rate to the network.
 
A “hash” is the actual cryptographic function run by the miners, and is a unique set of numbers and letters derived from the content of the block. The protocol governing the relevant blockchain sets certain requirements for the hash. Miners compete to be the first to generate a valid hash meeting these requirements and, thereby, secure payment for solving the block. Hash rate is the speed at which miners can complete the calculation, and therefore is a critical measure of performance and computational power. A high rate means a miner may complete more calculations over a given period and has a greater chance to solve a block. An individual miner has a hash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific cryptocurrency, and the blockchain-wide hash rate for a specific cryptocurrency can be understood as the aggregate of the hash rates of all of the miners actively trying to solve a block on that blockchain at a given time.
 
The protocols governing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are coded to regulate the frequency at which new blocks are verified by automatically adjusting what is known as the “mining difficulty,” which is the level of computational activity required before a new block is solved and verified. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain the protocol is coded such that a new block is solved and verified approximately every ten minutes, while on Ethereum blocks are designed to be solved approximately every twelve to fifteen seconds. As such, to the extent the hash power on the network is increased or decreased due to, for example, fluctuations in the number of active miners online, mining difficulty is correspondingly increased or decreased to maintain the preset interval for the verification of new blocks.
 
On certain cryptocurrency networks, including Bitcoin, the rewards for solving a block are also subject to periodic incremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. After a predetermined number of blocks are added to the blockchain, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term “halving.” The last halving for Bitcoin occurred on May 11, 2020. The next halving for Bitcoin is expected to occur in 2024, and as such, absent any changes to the Bitcoin protocols, the block reward will remain stable until then. By contrast, Ethereum does not have a maximum supply limit or pre-determined reduction in reward amounts. Rather, Ethereum currently has a fixed issuance schedule of 2.0 Ether per block mined. However, Ethereum has on two separate occasions reduced the quantity of ETH rewarded per block and may make additional changes in the future, whether or not Ethereum ultimately transitions to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Transaction fees are variable and depend on the level of activity on the network. Generally, transaction fees increase during times of network congestion, as miners will prefer transactions with higher fees, and therefore a higher fee can reduce the time to process a transaction, and decrease when there are fewer transactions on the network.
 
As the total amount of available hash rate has increased (particularly on the Bitcoin network), it has become increasingly difficult for any individual miner to independently solve a block and as a result “mining pools” have emerged as an efficient way for miners to pool resources. Mining pools aggregate the hash rate of various miners participating in the mining pool. In this way the mining pool, rather than an individual miner, receives the block reward and related transaction fees. The mining pool is organized by a third party who, in return for a percentage of the earned block rewards and transaction fees as a fee, administers the pool and ensures that the participants in the pool receive their share of the block reward and related transaction fees, generally pro-rata to their contributed hash rate. Mining pools offer miners more predictable and consistent revenue compared to mining individually. We participate in mining pools.
 
Our Strategy
 
Smart Growth
 
We aim to optimize our mining by identifying and purchasing the most profitable miners with industry-leading returns on investment and actively monitoring and adjusting the operation of those machines to enhance their performance. When planning our short- and long-term operating strategies and capital expenditures, we carefully monitor fluctuations and longer-term trends in the value of certain cryptocurrencies, which impacts the return on investment of machines. We also regularly evaluate potential innovations in geography, physical footprint, computing technology and similar areas to improve our operations and productivity. We believe this smart-growth strategy, including our commitment to mining efficiency and return on investment in miners, will enable us to build value over the long term.

Own and Operate Our Mining Facilities
 
We are investing heavily in purchasing, building and operating our mining facilities. By owning and operating our miners at facilities that offer competitive advantages, including access to reliable, low-cost, renewable power and room for expansion, we expect to have greater control over the timing of the purchase and deployment of our miners. We also may enhance our ability to intelligently and quickly adapt our operating model and reap savings compared to paying for outsourced operations and infrastructure. We anticipate that we will continue to consider other opportunities to integrate our operations, including with respect to both the software utilized by our fleet and the associated hardware.
Reliable, Low-Cost, Renewable Power
 
Power represents our highest variable direct cost for our mining operations, with electrical power required to operate the miners. We believe the combination of increased mining difficulty, driven by greater hash rates, and the periodic adjustment of reward rates, such as the halving of Bitcoin rewards, will drive the increasing importance of power efficiency in cryptocurrency mining over the long term. As a result, we are focused on deploying our miners at locations with access to reliable, renewable power sources, as successfully doing so should enable us to reduce our power costs.
 
Miners require considerable amounts of electrical energy to perform their functions and mine Bitcoin; consequently, a critical aspect of operating in the cryptocurrency mining industry is obtaining a reliable supply of electricity at a relatively low and stable cost. To this end, in January 2021, ACS purchased the Facility, which currently has access to 28 megawatts of power in preparation for the planned purchase of Bitcoin mining equipment. Since the purchase of the Facility, we have invested in infrastructure improvements and began both ramping up the sites power capacity and installing S19jPro miners. To date, we have increased power load from 1.5 megawatts to 14 megawatts and expect to have 28 megawatts installed at this location by July 2022. In addition, we have received a commitment by the utility company that currently provides our power to expand the site’s capacity up to 297 megawatts, for which we are currently working on setting forth in a formal agreement. Our relationship with the utility company has grown as we have demonstrated our ability to upgrade and use power at our site effectively. We are in the midst of finalizing those expansion details with the utility company, engineers, and Economic Development Agency. This planned expansion would allow the operation of up to as many as 90,000 Bitcoin miners at the Facility.
 
We continue to evaluate other sites, locations, and partnerships for additional and alternative support of future mining operations. While we have not at present entered into any other agreements, we will continue to explore and evaluate additional facilities that that would enable us to expand our mining operations as needed.
 
We expect to enter into power agreements that will allow us to have one of the highest carbon-free energy footprints at a price equal to or less than the current cost of fossil fuel energy in other locations, based on current market power costs as of the date of this Annual Report.
 
Our Mining Operations
 
On January 29, 2021, ACS closed on the acquisition of the 617,000 square foot energy-efficient Facility for a purchase price of $4.0 million. The purchase price was paid by our own working capital. The Facility has been remodeled and converted over the past year into a site focused on three types of business (commercial real estate, enterprise data center, and high-density computing).
 
The buildout of the initial 30,000 square feet will be used primarily for our Bitcoin mining operations. While we believe the Facility and its anticipated future operations will be successful, there is a risk that its expectations will not materialize in a timely manner, if at all.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we executed contracts to purchase 4,000 Antminer S-19 Pro Bitcoin miners. As of February 15, 2022, we have 2,160 Bitcoin miners in operation. The remaining units are expected to be delivered at a rate of approximately 300 units per month through July 2022. The total purchase price is $27.3 million. In November 2021, we executed contracts to purchase 16,600 Bitcoin miners for $128 million. The purchase includes both the environmentally friendly S19 XP Antminers that feature a processing power of 140 terahashes per second (TH/s) with an energy consumption of 3.01 kilowatt-hours (kWh) and the S19j Pro Antminers that feature a processing power of 100 TH/s with an energy consumption of 2.95 kWh. Based on current delivery schedules, we expect that the 16,600 newly purchased miners will be shipped by Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) between approximately April 2022 and September 2022. Approximately $89 million of the total purchase price has been paid as of March 8, 2022 with the balance scheduled to be paid between March 2022 and November 2022. The supplier, Bitmain, does not disclose when the miners are manufactured. We have a futures purchase contract and Bitmain has been supplying equipment according to the scheduled delivery as outlined in these agreements. All dollar amounts provided in this paragraph include fees payable in connection with obtaining the ability to enter into the contracts, and not solely the cost of the miners.
 
Our strategy includes identifying less expensive, clean power for our Bitcoin mining operations. Management of the company has considered the issues surrounding the environmental impact of our Bitcoin mining operations. Based on this review, we have concluded that the environmental impact of our mining operations is not material given that approximately 85% of the energy we use is “green,” meaning it is sourced from nuclear, wind or solar power. In addition to our continued expansion investments at the Facility, we also seek out new locations to support our Bitcoin mining business. We consider sites with a variety of offerings, including purchasing the site (as we have done in Michigan), but also leasing buildings and facilities, hosting relationships and strategic partnerships. At this time, we have not entered into any new mining agreements at locations other than the Facility. We currently mine Bitcoin only.


Coins that are mined are held in a custodial account as digital assets. We securely store assets at NYDIG ABL LLC (“NYDIG”), a regulated, audited and insured cryptocurrency custodian. The custody arrangements require that we mine to a custodial wallet address where the private key is held by the custodian and all keys for the wallet are held in cold storage. This provides a layer of protection in both the transaction and liquidation phases of the operations by using multi-factor and multi-person approval processes, to include Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering procedures of the receiving party. We will either hold the digital assets or may choose to convert those assets into fiat currency depending on financial needs and plans. When we opt to convert the digital assets we sell or exchange our Bitcoin through NYDIG, the custodian of our digital wallet. When we elect to make a sale or exchange our Senior Vice President - Finance submits a request to NYDIG’s execution department to exchange Bitcoin for U.S. dollars. NYDIG sends an approval email to our CEO to approve. Once approved by our CEO, NYDIG executes the sale/exchange on its trading platform at current market prices, less commissions, and deposits the U.S. dollars into our bank account.
 
Currently, we are converting Bitcoin received from our mining activities into fiat currency on a bimonthly basis, on average, to pay for operating costs and purchase commitments for new mining equipment. We are not currently holding any digital assets for investment.
 
Our Contracts with Bitmain
 
Between July and November 2021, we entered into five separate Non-Fixed Price Sales and Purchase Agreements (collectively, the “Bitmain Agreements”) with Bitmain, as follows:
 

● | Pursuant to the Bitmain Agreement dated July 23, 2021, Bitmain agreed to sell 1,000 Antminer S-19 Pro miners for the estimated total purchase price of $2,550,000, which miners have been delivered;

● | Pursuant to the Bitmain Agreement, dated September 12, 2021, Bitmain agreed to sell 3,000 Antminer S-19 Pro miners for the estimated total purchase price of $20,509,500, which miners have been delivered;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to the Bitmain Agreement dated November 10, 2021, Bitmain agreed to sell 4,000 S19 XP miners for the estimated total purchase price of $45,360,000, which miners are expected to be shipped monthly between July and September 2022;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to the Bitmain Agreement dated November 17, 2021, Bitmain agreed to sell 12,000 S19j miners for the estimated total purchase price of $76,000,000, of which 754 have miners have been delivered and the balance of the miners are expected to be shipped monthly between April and August 2022; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to the Bitmain Agreement dated November 17, 2021, Bitmain agreed to sell 600 S19XP miners for the estimated total purchase price of $6,510,000, which miners are expected to be shipped monthly between July and December 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within seven days after the signing of each Bitmain Agreement, we paid Bitmain a down payment within the range of 25% and 31.86% of the estimated total purchase price, and an additional prepayment within the range of 28.14% and 35% of the actual purchase price for each monthly batch scheduled for shipment, which is due six months prior to shipment. The actual purchase price for such batch to be shipped six months later will be provided by Bitmain one month prior to the shipment of the current batch, provided that the actual purchase price will not be higher than the total purchase price set forth in the payment schedules in the Bitmain Agreements.
 
All of the miners we are purchasing are newly manufactured and not pre-owned. We are not aware if Bitmain is experiencing any supply side constraints in its ability to fulfill the Bitmain Agreements; to date, Bitmain has timely delivered all miners pursuant to the delivery schedule in such agreements.
 
Regulation
 
The laws and regulations applicable to cryptocurrency are evolving and subject to interpretation and change. Governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments, such as the People’s Republic of China, have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., cryptocurrencies are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. As cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market value, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the “FinCEN”), the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (the “FINRA”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFTC”), the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and state financial regulators, have been examining the operations of cryptocurrency networks, cryptocurrency users and cryptocurrency exchange markets, with particular focus on the extent to which cryptocurrencies can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness and consumer-protective safeguards of exchanges or other service-providers that hold, transfer, trade or exchange digital assets for users. For instance, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the DOJ published a report entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” in October 2020. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the possible threats and enforcement challenges the DOJ views as associated with the use and prevalence of cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory and investigatory means the DOJ has at its disposal to deal with these possible threats and challenges.
 
Many of these federal and state agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by cryptocurrencies to investors. In addition, federal and state agencies, and other countries have issued rules or guidance about the treatment of cryptocurrency transactions or requirements for businesses engaged in activities related to cryptocurrencies. Depending on the regulatory characterization of the cryptocurrencies we mine, the markets for those cryptocurrencies in general, and our activities in particular, may be subject to one or more regulators in the U.S. and globally. Ongoing and future regulatory actions may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of cryptocurrency markets and our cryptocurrency operations. Additionally, U.S. state and federal, and foreign regulators and legislatures have taken action against cryptocurrency businesses or enacted restrictive regimes in response to adverse publicity arising from hacks, consumer harm, or criminal activity stemming from cryptocurrency activity. There is also increasing attention being paid by U.S. federal and state energy regulatory authorities as the total load of crypto-mining grows and potentially alters the supply and dispatch functionality of the wholesale grid and retail distribution systems. Many state legislative bodies are also actively reviewing the impact of crypto-mining in their respective states.
 
We are unable to predict the effect that any future regulatory change, or any overlapping or unclear regulations, may have on us, but such change, overlap or lack of clarity could be substantial and make it difficult for us to operate our business or materially impact the market for cryptocurrencies that we mine or may mine in the future. FinCEN has issued guidance stating its position that it does not differentiate between fiat currency (which FinCEN calls “real currency”) and cryptocurrencies that are convertible into fiat currency or other forms of convertible virtual currencies (which FinCEN calls “virtual currency”) for purposes of determining whether a person or entity is engaging in “money transmission services.” Persons and entities engaging in virtual currency activities that amount to “money transmission services,” or otherwise cause them to be deemed a “money services business” under FinCEN’s regulations, must register as a money services business, implement an “effective” anti-money laundering program and comply with FinCEN’s reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

--


In May 2019, FinCEN issued guidance relating to how the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and its implementing regulations relating to money services businesses apply to certain businesses that transact in convertible virtual currencies. Although the guidance generally indicates that certain mining and mining pool operations will not be treated as money transmission, the guidance also addresses when certain activities, including certain services offered in connection with operating mining pools such as hosting convertible virtual currency wallets on behalf of pool members or purchasers of computer mining power, may be subject to regulation. Although we believe that our mining activities do not presently trigger FinCEN registration requirements under the BSA, if our activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter,” “money services business” or equivalent designation, under federal law, we may be required to register at the federal level and comply with laws that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, reporting and recordkeeping regimes, and other operational requirements. In that event, to the extent we decide to proceed with some or all of our operations, the required registration and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us, as well as on-going recurring compliance costs, possibly affecting operating results or financial condition in a material and adverse manner. Failure to comply with these requirements may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
 
According to the CFTC, at least some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, fall within the definition of a “commodity” under the U.S. Commodities Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “CEA”). Under the CEA, the CFTC has broad enforcement authority to police market manipulation and fraud in spot cryptocurrency markets in which we may transact. Beyond instances of fraud or manipulation, the CFTC generally does not oversee cash or spot market exchanges or transactions involving cryptocurrencies that do not utilize margin, leverage, or financing. The National Futures Association (“NFA”) is the self-regulatory agency for the U.S. futures industry, and as such has jurisdiction over Bitcoin futures contracts and certain other cryptocurrency derivatives. However, the NFA does not have regulatory oversight authority for the cash or spot market for cryptocurrency trading or transactions. In addition, CFTC regulations and CFTC oversight and enforcement authority apply with respect to futures, swaps, other derivative products, and certain retail leveraged commodity transactions involving cryptocurrencies, including the markets on which these products trade.
 
The SEC has taken the position that many cryptocurrencies may be securities under U.S. federal securities laws. Some senior members of the staff of the SEC have expressed the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities under U.S. federal securities laws. However, such statements are not official policy statements by the SEC and reflect only the speakers’ views, which are not binding on the SEC or any other agency or court and cannot be generalized to any other cryptocurrency. The SEC’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology published a framework for analyzing whether any given cryptocurrency is a security in April 2019. However, this framework is also not a rule, regulation or statement of the SEC and is similarly not binding on the SEC. Notwithstanding that the SEC has not asserted regulatory authority over Bitcoin or trading or ownership of Bitcoin and has not expressed the view that Bitcoin should be classified or treated as a security for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws, the SEC has commented on Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related market developments and has taken action against investment schemes involving Bitcoin. For example, the SEC has charged at least three Bitcoin mining companies in connection with a Ponzi scheme to defraud investors in their mining operation. The SEC has also repeatedly denied proposed rule changes by exchanges to list and trade shares of certain Bitcoin-related investment vehicles on public markets, citing significant investor protection concerns regarding the markets for cryptocurrencies, including the potential for market manipulation and fraud. Although the SEC has not stated that mining Bitcoin is itself a regulated activity, to the extent any cryptocurrencies we mine are deemed to be securities, the offer, sale, and trading of those cryptocurrencies would be subject to the U.S. federal securities laws.
 
In addition to the SEC, state securities regulators and several foreign governments have also issued warnings that certain cryptocurrencies may be classified as securities in their jurisdictions, and that transactions in such cryptocurrencies may be subject to applicable securities regulations. Furthermore, certain state securities regulators have taken the position that certain cryptocurrency mining operations may involve the offer of securities. For example, the Texas State Securities Board has taken enforcement action against the operator of a cloud mining company, whereby customers could purchase hash rate managed by the cloud mining company in exchange for a share of the mining reward, for offering unregistered securities.
 
State financial regulators, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), have also implemented licensure regimes, or repurposed pre-existing fiat money transmission licensure regimes, for the supervision, examination and regulation companies that engage in certain cryptocurrency activities. The NYDFS requires that businesses apply for and receive a license, known as the “BitLicense,” to participate in a “virtual currency business activity” in New York or with New York customers, and prohibits any person or entity involved in such activity from conducting activities without a license. Louisiana also has enacted a licensure regime for companies engaging in a “virtual currency business activity,” and other states are considering proposed laws to establish licensure regimes for certain cryptocurrency businesses as well. Some state legislatures have amended their money transmitter statutes to require businesses engaging in certain cryptocurrency activities to seek licensure as a money transmitter, and some state financial regulators have issued guidance applying existing money transmitter licensure requirements to certain cryptocurrency businesses. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors also has proposed a model statute for state level cryptocurrency regulation. Although we believe that our mining activities do not presently trigger these state licensing requirements in any state in which we operate or plan to operate, if our activities cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter,” “money services business” or equivalent designation under the law of any state in which we operate or plan to operate, we may be required to seek a license or register at the state level and comply with laws that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, reporting and recordkeeping regimes, consumer protective safeguards, and other operational requirements. In such an event, to the extent we decide to proceed with some or all of our operations, the required registrations, licensure and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary, non-recurring expenses to us, as well as on-going recurring compliance costs, possibly affecting our net income in a material and adverse manner. Failure to comply with these requirements may expose us to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Competition
 
Our business environment is constantly evolving, and cryptocurrency miners can range from individual enthusiasts to professional mining operations with dedicated data centers. We compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on cryptocurrency mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, the ability to raise capital, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry.
 
At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises may not be readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include “bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info”; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured and the contents of these sites are not incorporated into this Annual Report.

Intellectual Property
 
We plan to use specific hardware and software for our cryptocurrency mining operations. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, we intend to adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.

We do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further develop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our planned cryptocurrency mining operations.
 
Accounting for Digital Currencies
 
Digital currencies are included in current assets in the combined balance sheet. Digital currencies are recorded at cost less any impairment. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If we conclude otherwise, we will be required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. We account for our mining-related gains or losses in accordance with the first-in, first-out method of accounting.
Blockchain Background
 
Blockchain technology first came to public attention in 2008 as the database technology that underpins Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency. Blockchains are generally open-source, peer-to-peer software programs that act as decentralized digital ledgers, each comprising a series of data “blocks” that are linked and secured using cryptography in a “chain.” The blockchain program consists of a software protocol with several functions. The software protocol is run by multiple computer systems or “nodes.” For many blockchain networks, each node has its own copy of the blockchain ledger, which contains a historical record of every transaction. The digital ledger continuously grows as new blocks are added to it to record the most recent transactions in a linear, chronological order. The same information is stored across a network of computers all over the world, and this record makes it possible to track the ownership and transfer of cryptocurrency from the creation of the blockchain to its current state, and effectively, records of all account balances (as you can identify what account holds what value through the decentralized ledger).
 
The blockchain protocol allows users to submit transactions to the network for confirmation. However, a transaction will not be accepted by the protocol if the inputs to the transaction have previously been used in another transaction. This prevention of “double spending” is a key security feature of blockchain networks.
 
Another key function of the blockchain that protects the integrity of the network is the hashing process, which acts as a tamper-evident seal that confirms the validity of the new block and all earlier blocks. Hashing is the process of a block being posted to the network. Hashing results from miners, who are responsible for receiving broadcast transactions, processing those transactions into new blocks and updating the blockchain with the new blocks through hashing. The hashing process ties every new block to the existing block on the blockchain to ensure each is a continuous record of verified transactions.
 
The hashing algorithm on a proof-of-work blockchain network is a mathematical transformation function with two key properties. The first important function of hashing is that the algorithm accepts any alphanumeric dataset as an input and produces a unique output code. The smallest change in the dataset results in a significant change in the unique code. Any tampering of the dataset can be detected by re-hashing the data and checking for a change in the unique code. Any user that runs the hash algorithm on the same data will derive the same unique code. Consequently, the data on the distributed ledger can be run through a series of hash algorithms to create a unique code, which would reveal if any changes to the ledger have been made.
 
Second, whenever a new set or “block” of transactions is added to the ledger, it is appended with the code from the prior state of the ledger before it is hashed. Thus, the hash created from the new block will incorporate the hash from the previous block. An alteration made to an earlier block would make the hashes of all subsequent blocks invalid, as the discrepancy would be easily detected by future miners through the protocols governing the blockchain. If a hacker were to attempt to make a change to an earlier block and broadcast it along with following blocks to the other nodes on the network, that broadcast would be discarded in favor of one from a different node which complied with the requirements of the protocol.

Thus, in addition to creating new block, miners “vote” with their computer power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on adding them to the blockchain, and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. If a miner’s proposed block is added to the blockchain by a majority of the nodes on the network, it is considered part of the blockchain. The nodes on the network synchronize with each other to ensure that once a block is accepted by the majority, the new block will eventually be added to all the nodes. Thus the historical state of the ledger can be changed if control of more than 50% of the network is obtained; however, in the case of widely held cryptocurrencies with non-trivial valuations, it may be economically prohibitive for any actor or group of actors acting in concert to obtain computing power that consists of more than 50% of the network.
 
Unlike proof-of-work networks, in which miners expend computational resources to compete to validate transactions and are rewarded cryptocurrency in proportion to the amount of computational resources expended, in a proof-of-stake network, miners (sometimes called validators) risk or “stake” assets to compete to be randomly selected to validate transactions and are rewarded cryptocurrency in proportion to the amount of assets staked. Any malicious activity, such as mining multiple blocks, disagreeing with the eventual consensus or otherwise violating protocol rules, results in the forfeiture or “slashing” of a portion of the staked assets. Proof-of-stake is viewed by some as more energy efficient and scalable than proof-of-work.
 
Blockchain technology enables the secure use and transfer of digital assets. “Digital asset” is a broad term that encompasses additional applications, including ownership, transaction tracking, identity management, and smart contracts. A digital asset can represent physical or virtual assets, a value, or a use right/service (e.g., computer storage space).
 
Whereas digital assets can take many forms and be used for a variety of functions, cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset that primarily function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value. Cryptocurrencies allow anyone who holds a compatible wallet, anywhere in the world, to hold and transfer that cryptocurrency without the need for an intermediary or trusted third party. Units of a cryptocurrency may exist only as data on the internet, and often are not issued or controlled by any single institution, authority or government. Whereas most of the world’s money currently exists in the form of electronic records managed by central authorities such as banks, units of a non-government cryptocurrency exist as electronic records in a decentralized blockchain database. Because cryptocurrencies have no inherent intrinsic value, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined by the value that various market participants place on them through their transactions. Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have historically exhibited high price volatility relative to more traditional asset classes.
 
Private entities also issue digital assets called “stablecoins” that are designed to represent an underlying fiat currency or other physical asset and therefore less susceptible to volatility. Stablecoins can be backed by fiat money, physical assets, or other crypto assets. Government institutions are also reportedly testing and considering issuing Central Bank Digital Currencies (“CBDC’s”). While stablecoins or CBDC’s may exhibit less price volatility than other cryptocurrencies, both rely on a central authority to establish the value of the asset, and therefore represent an exception to the general discussion of the design of cryptocurrencies herein.
 
Each cryptocurrency has a source code that comprises the basis for the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols, which govern the blockchain. The source code is commonly open source and therefore can be inspected by anyone, and is maintained on an ongoing basis through contributors proposing amendments to the protocol, which are peer reviewed and adopted by consensus among participants on the blockchain network. These protocols govern the functioning of the network, including the ownership and transfer of the cryptocurrency, and are executed on the decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain infrastructure. The peer-to-peer infrastructure on which a blockchain operates is not owned or operated by a single entity. Instead, the infrastructure is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Each peer user is generally known as a “node” or “miner,” and each miner processes transactions on the network in accordance with the protocols of the relevant cryptocurrency.
 
As a result, these cryptocurrencies do not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of units of cryptocurrency. Rather:
 

● | the creation of units of cryptocurrency generally is governed by the source code, not a central entity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the transmission of a cryptocurrency is governed by the source code and processed by the decentralized peer-to-peer network of nodes or miners; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the value of a cryptocurrency is generally determined by the market supply of and demand for the cryptocurrency, with prices set in transfers by mutual agreement or barter, as well as through acceptance directly by merchants in exchange for goods and services.

Cryptocurrencies may be open source projects with no official developer or group of developers that control the network. However, certain networks’ development may be overseen informally by a core group of developers that may propose quasi-official releases of updates and other changes to the network’s source code. The release of updates to a blockchain network’s source code does not guarantee that the updates will be automatically adopted. Users and miners must accept any changes made to the source code by downloading the proposed modification of the network’s source code. A modification of the network’s source code is effective only with respect to the users and miners that download it. If a modification is accepted by only a percentage of users and miners, a division in the network will occur such that one network will run the pre-modification source code and the other network will run the modified source code. Such a division is known as a “fork.” Consequently, a modification to the source code becomes part of a blockchain network only if accepted by participants collectively having most of the processing power on the network.
 
Each “account” on a blockchain network is identified by its unique public key, and is secured with its associated private key (which the account holder must keep secret, like a password). Cryptocurrencies are treated as bearer assets, because possession of the private key generally determines who controls or owns a cryptocurrency. Protecting private keys from unwarranted access and theft is critically important, as once the private key is taken, in most circumstances, control over the related cryptocurrency is gone. The combination of private and public cryptographic keys constitutes a secure digital identity in the form of a digital signature. As long as the private key is kept private (i.e., confidential to the owner of the account) it provides strong control of ownership.
 
Ault Alliance
 
We acquire controlling or non-controlling interests in and actively manage businesses that we generally believe (i) are undervalued and have disruptive technologies with a global impact, (ii) operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, (iii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and (v) have strong management teams largely in place. We offer investors a unique opportunity to own a diverse group of leading middle-market businesses in the niche-industrial and branded-consumer sectors.
 
We use a traditional methodology for valuing securities that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. Upon making an investment, we often become actively involved in the companies we seek to acquire. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve stockholder value, to acquiring a controlling or non-controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business.
 
We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their business units may consider us an attractive purchaser because of our ability to:
 

● | provide ongoing strategic and financial support for their businesses, including professionalization of our subsidiaries at scale;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain a long-term outlook as to the ownership of those businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | sustainably invest in growth capital and/or add-on acquisitions where appropriate; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consummate transactions efficiently without being dependent on third-party transaction financing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In particular, we believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many private company operators and parent companies may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses.
 
Finally, it has been our experience that our ability to acquire businesses without the cumbersome delays and conditions typical of third party transactional financing is appealing to sellers of businesses who are interested in confidentiality, speed and certainty to close.

We believe our management team’s strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us substantial opportunities to assess small businesses available for acquisition. In addition, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.
 
In terms of the businesses in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2021, we believe that these businesses have strong management teams, operate in strong markets with defensible market niches, and maintain long-standing customer relationships.
 
Our Subsidiaries
 
The following is a brief summary of the businesses in which Ault Alliance owns a controlling interest at December 31, 2021:
 
DP Lending
 
DP Lending provides funding to businesses through loans and investments. DP Lending offers a variety of loan types including commercial loans, convertible notes and revolving lines of credit. DP Lending is engaged in providing commercial loans to companies throughout the U.S. to provide them with operating capital to finance the growth of their businesses. The loans are primarily short-term, ranging from six to twelve months, but may be of longer duration. These terms are subject to change as market needs dictate, and DP Lending anticipates offering additional products in the future.
 
DP Lending uses its considerable financial experience, data analytics, and a credit scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of each small business borrower applicant. If the business meets DP Lending’s criteria, DP Lending sets the initial interest rate according to its credit and financial models. The final interest rate offered to the borrower will be determined by DP Lending’s interpretation of the marketplace. In order to borrow from DP Lending, borrowers must display characteristics indicative of durable business and financial situations. These include factors such as revenue, time in business, number of employees, and financial and credit variables. In order to qualify, business borrower applicants must be approved through DP Lending’s underwriting process, which analyzes credit and financial data of both the business and the business owner. DP Lending takes into account several business factors (including revenue, age of business, cash flows, and other variables). The underwriting process determines the loan amount to approve, how loans will be priced, and whether to include a blanket lien is based on the above analysis, as well as additional factors (including length of loan, estimated default rates by type and grade, and general economic environment).
 
Our Executive Committee, which is comprised of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, acts as the underwriting committee for DP Lending and approves all lending transactions. The Executive Committee has decades of experience in financial, investing and securities transactions. Under its business model, DP Lending generates revenue through origination fees charged to borrowers and interest generated from each loan. DP Lending may also generate income from appreciation of investments in marketable securities as well as any shares of common stock underlying convertible notes or warrants issued to DP Lending in any particular financing.
 
As noted above, we will from time to time, through DP Lending, engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our stockholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, transactions in their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings, mergers or spin-offs and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these and functionally equivalent programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our stockholders.
 
During 2022, we anticipate providing significant new funding to expand DP Lending’s loan and investment portfolio. DP Lending loans made or arranged pursuant to a California Financing Law license (Lic.no. 60 DBO77905).

Ault Alpha
 
DP Lending is the principal owner of Ault Alpha, a term we use that comprises an investment fund, a general partner and an investment manager all formed on July 15, 2021. Ault Alpha generally seeks to invest in public companies or private companies with public debt that have strong relative value metrics but poor Wall Street recognition; such companies can often experience valuation inefficiencies. Ault Alpha seeks to identify and invest in these undervalued companies. In certain companies, Ault Alpha will actively intervene to assist management to maximize stockholder value. Ault Alpha believes that an activist role can result in the creation of significant value and larger than average returns on investment. Ault Alpha will own a concentrated portfolio, and typically invest with a long-term perspective. Further, Ault Alpha will employ a systematic process, developed over decades of collective experience in the capital and credit markets, to seek specific value-creating events and/or special situations, to provide compelling return potential and generate competitive capital appreciation and total return by making investments in three key categories: (i) undervalued or overvalued assets; (ii) activist trading; and (iii) volatility trading and arbitrage. Ault Alpha has purchased the Company’s common stock in open-market transactions.
AGREE
 
AGREE seeks to invest in various classes of commercial and residential real estate including hospitality, multifamily, and industrial properties targeting the middle market segment in locations demonstrating relative value. AGREE’s objective is to generate risk adjusted returns through development, capital investment and operational improvement, leveraging the management team’s expertise and well-established relationships with real estate investment professionals, brokers, lenders and developers. The focus will be in U.S. tertiary markets with growing populations, income growth and access to highly populated metropolitan areas as primary demand drivers. AGREE is one of BitNile’s strategies to invest in inflation-resistant undervalued assets and realize capital appreciation through cap rate compression over time. AGREE owns and operates both Third Avenue Apartments and AGREE Madison.
Ault Media Group
 
Ault Media Group (“AMG”) is comprised of a diverse team of media professionals with expertise in creating all forms of media, communications, and content including web development, corporate communications, social media, scripted, and unscripted television. Our online virtual training courses (via the LightSpeedVT platform) also offer in-depth business learning. AMG’s specialized team of producers brings years of university-proven training methods and a history of developing educational materials up to a Master's degree level. AMG’s first course, relating to initial public offerings, is currently in the final stages of production, with more courses soon to follow.
 
Along with training and communications strategies, AMG also offers comprehensive consulting for the development and execution of large and small scale conferences and event planning. From event space acquisition to digital ticketing, keynote speakers, lighting, stage crews, and advertising media buys, AMG will provide the necessary contacts and guidance to assure a successful and smooth-running event.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our business strategy is designed to increase shareholder value. Under this strategy, we are focused on managing and financially supporting our existing subsidiaries and partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to shareholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: public offerings, the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value, such as activist trading. We anticipate returning value to shareholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
 
Our Executive Committee approves and manages our investment strategy. Upon making an investment, we often become actively involved in the companies we seek to acquire. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve stockholder value, to acquiring a controlling or sizable but non-controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business.
 
From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our subsidiaries or partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a subsidiary partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our shareholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the subsidiary or partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the subsidiary or partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, transactions in their securities in the open market. Our plans may include taking subsidiaries or partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these and functionally equivalent programs and the sale of certain subsidiary or partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our shareholders.

Management Strategy
 
Our management strategy involves the proactive financial and operational management of the businesses we own in order to increase cash flows and stockholder value. Ault Alliance actively oversees and supports the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things:

● | recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses using structured incentive compensation programs, including non-controlling equity ownership, tailored to each business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying and aligning with external policy and performance tailwinds such as those influenced by growing climate, health, and social justice concerns (and similar environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) drivers);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assisting management in controlling and right-sizing overhead costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | nurturing an internal culture of transparency, alignment, accountability and governance, including regular reporting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | professionalizing our subsidiaries at scale; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Specifically, while our businesses have different growth opportunities and potential rates of growth, we expect Ault Alliance to work with the management teams of each of our businesses to increase the value of, and cash generated by, each business through various initiatives, including:
 

● | making selective capital investments to expand geographic reach, increase capacity, or reduce manufacturing costs of our businesses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | investing in product research and development for new products, processes or services for customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improving and expanding existing sales and marketing programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuing reductions in operating costs through improved operational efficiency or outsourcing of certain processes and products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consolidating or improving management of certain overhead functions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our businesses typically acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We believe that complementary add-on acquisitions improve our overall financial and operational performance by allowing us to:
 

● | leverage manufacturing and distribution operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | leverage branding and marketing programs, as well as customer relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | add experienced management or management expertise;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | increase market share and penetrate new markets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | realize cost synergies by allocating the corporate overhead expenses of our businesses across a larger number of businesses and by implementing and coordinating improved management practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe to be to undervalued and have disruptive technologies with a global impact that we expect to produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. In this respect, we expect to make acquisitions in industries other than those in which our businesses currently operate if we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities will continue to present themselves, as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in long-standing and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their “non-core” operations.

Our ideal acquisition candidate has the following characteristics:
 

● | is a leading branded consumer or niche industrial company headquartered in North America;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintains highly defensible position in the markets it serves and with customers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operates in an industry with favorable long-term macroeconomic trends;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | has a strong management team, either currently in place or previously identified, and meaningful incentives;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | has low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintains a diversified customer and supplier base.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
We benefit from Ault Alliance’s ability to identify potential diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our Executive Committee and other members of our management team’s experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, Ault Alliance:
 

● | engages in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | critically evaluates the target management team;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | identifies and assesses any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of the target business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analyzes comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | actively researches and evaluates information on the relevant industry; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | thoroughly negotiates appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The process of acquiring new businesses is both time-consuming and complex. Our management team historically has taken from two to six months to perform due diligence, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although our management team is at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be periods of time during which our management team does not recommend any new acquisitions. Even if an acquisition is recommended by our management team, our Board may not approve it.
 
A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third-party financing, provides us with an advantage in successfully acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In addition, our strategy of providing this intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of principle on these intercompany loans.
 
Upon acquisition of a new business, we rely on our management team’s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a successful business plan.
 
Strategic Advantages
 
Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our management team has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our management team has a successful track record of acquiring and managing businesses in various industries. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our management team has been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations.
 
Our management team has a large network of deal intermediaries whom we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team’s proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our management team also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our acquired businesses.

Valuation and Due Diligence
 
When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, our management team performs rigorous due diligence and a financial evaluations process including an evaluation of the operations of the target business and the outlook for its industry. While valuation of a business is a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including:

● | discounted cash flow analyses;
--+-------------------------------


● | evaluation of trading values of comparable companies;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | expected value matrices; and
--+-----------------------------


● | examination of comparable recent transactions.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
One outcome of this process is a projection of the expected cash flows from the target business. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that with detailed due diligence, future cash flows will be better estimated and the prospects for operating the business in the future better evaluated. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage, as necessary, third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary.
 
A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute our business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business.
 
Financing
 
We incur third party debt financing almost entirely at the parent company level, which we use, in combination with our equity capital, to provide debt financing to each of our businesses and to acquire additional businesses. We believe this financing structure is beneficial to the financial and operational activities of each of our businesses by aligning our interests as both equity holders of, and lenders to, our businesses, in a manner that we believe is more efficient than each of our businesses borrowing from third-party lenders.

The EV Charging Industry and Our Revenue Models
 
The market for battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEVs”) has experienced substantial growth in the past five years, and we believe that growth will increase significantly over the next five years. As the economic and environmental costs of fossil fuel burning automobiles increases each year, consumer demand for vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, greater performance and with lower or no environmental emissions has also increased. With a variety of federal, state and municipal incentive programs for both EV drivers and EV supply equipment infrastructure construction, we anticipate a significant increase in the demand for BEV and PHEV charging solutions at home, work and in public settings.  

26
--


The market for sustained growth of the EV charging industry is substantial and continuing worldwide. Multiple states and municipalities have set ambitious zero emission vehicle goals for the next ten years. In order to meet these goals, mandates for EV sales have been established by states like California, New York, Oregon and Washington. At the same time, oil and gas prices continue to rise and EV battery technology continues to improve and become more affordable. The average consumer cost to acquire an EV declined 13.5% from 2018 to 2019, according to general industry statistics, and continues to fall as more automobile manufacturers introduce new EV models to the market each year.
 
According to the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sales of plug-in vehicles since introduction to the market in 2010 is over 500,000 vehicles and, according to a third-party research firm, sales are expected to grow by a factor of 12 to over 4,000,000 vehicles in 2025. The cost to maintain an EV is half of what it costs to maintain an internal combustion engine (“ICE”) automobile, according to third party research, and the cost to add 200 miles of range to an ICE car is roughly twice the cost of its all-electric counterpart.  
 
The final barrier to widespread BEV and PHEV adoption is the current status of the EV charging infrastructure. We believe that the demand for EV charging is increasing each day. Utility companies are upgrading their grid infrastructure in preparation for the increased demand. We expect the demand from businesses, municipalities and individuals to outpace supply over the next five years, creating a highly favorable environment for EVSE companies. 
 
We believe that providing energy efficiency in all our power supply and EV charging products leads to long term environmental benefits for society. Increasing consumer demand for EVs provides an opportunity for our charging infrastructure and solutions to be used for powering vehicles with little to no tailpipe emissions or other pollutants. With a shared mission to do our part to fight climate change, we strive to bring to established and emerging markets innovative electronics-driven solutions that provide value for our company and stockholders.
 
EV Charging Revenue Models
 
We intend to generate revenues with TOG Technologies primarily through the sale of networked charging hardware, combined with cloud-based services that provide end users the ability to locate and transact with EV chargers, and provide site host customers with the ability to operate and manage their chargers (the “TOG Network” or “TOG Network Services”). TOG Network Services, and an optional extended warranty, are billed as an annual subscription, and access to the network is available through each of our commercial charging ports. We expect that the revenue contribution for recurring TOG Network or extended warranty sales will equal the revenue contribution from one-time EV1100 charger sales for commercial use after approximately seven years. TOG Technologies also offers a hardware portfolio powered by software, which cannot be accessed without a TOG Network subscription.
EV Charging Unit Sales. We recognize revenues through the sale of our charging solutions in the form of hardware sales and extended warranty purchases. We intend to employ various business models with customers for our EV charging unit sales based on which party bears the costs of installation, equipment and maintenance, and the relative percentages of the continuing, long-term revenue-sharing arrangement.
EV Charging Network Services. We intend to provide EV charging network services, including management of user authentication, billing and payments, and power management (also called load balancing). These services will be made available through a recurring subscription business model or through a revenue sharing arrangement that enables us to retain a percentage of the revenue generated from EV charging.
 
OEM Charging and Related Services. Through discussions with OEM partners, we are pioneering innovative revenue models to meet a wide variety of OEM objectives related to the availability of charging infrastructure and provisioning charging services for EV drivers. We are contracting directly with OEMs to provide charging services to drivers who have purchased or leased EVs from such OEMs and who access our public charger network.
 
Retail Charging. We intend to sell electricity directly to EV drivers who access our publicly available networked chargers. We offer various pricing plans for customers. Drivers have the choice of charging either as members (with monthly fees and reduced per-minute pricing) through a subscription service, or on a per-use basis as non-members. Drivers locate chargers through our mobile application, their vehicle’s in-dash navigation system, or third-party databases that license charger location information from us. We aim to install our chargers in parking spaces owned or leased by commercial or public entity site hosts that desire to provide our charging services at their locations. Commercial suite hosts include retail centers, offices, medical complexes, airports and convenience stores. We offer charging hosts a range of revenue-sharing arrangements.

27
--

Commercial Charging. High volume fleet customers, such as delivery services, can access our charging infrastructure through our public network. Pricing for charging services is to be negotiated directly between us and the fleet owner based on business needs and usage patterns of the fleet, and we will typically contract with and bill the fleet owner directly rather than the individual fleet drivers who utilize our chargers. Access to our public network enables fleet and rideshare operators to support mass adoption of transportation electrification and achieve sustainability goals while avoiding direct capital investments in charging infrastructure or the incurrence of operating costs associated with charging equipment.

Overall global defense spending is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”), of 3% through 2028, with U.S. defense spending continuing to lead the world in the same period, according to ASD Reports, Global Defense Budget Analysis—Forecast to 2028. The current conflict in the Ukraine has intensified interest and investment in defense platforms throughout the United Kingdom (U.K.”) and Europe.
 
We believe that the drive for increased situational awareness and close coordination of air, land, sea, space and cyber operations will fuel an increase in defense electronics subsystems and components with total spending in 2022 of $130 billion and a projected CAGR of 5.6% through 2024, according to Global Defense Electronics Market, Trends, Driver and Outlook for 2020 and Beyond, Renaissance Strategic Advisors, September 2020. The drive for greater connectivity and analytics will in turn increase demand for RF communications, power solutions and electronic control systems content in new major military platforms, right in the sweet spot of GWW’s operating units.

Tens of thousands of companies compete in this market to deliver electronics solutions to meet defense and other mission critical applications. However, GWW’s operating units have longstanding relationships with dominant defense contractors in the U.S. (Lockheed, BAE Systems, L3Harris, Raytheon, Boeing), in the U.K. (BAE, Rolls Royce, Thales, Babcock) and in Israel (Israeli Air Industries, Rafael, Elbit Systems), which hold contracts for major defense platforms with very long life cycles. These relationships enable GWW to narrow the field of competition considerably and thereby to grow based on repeat business with relatively low selling costs.
 
Beyond the defense arena, initiatives to complete $63 billion in upgrades to the current National Railway System in the U.K. over the next five years while spending $130 billion over the next 10 years to build a high speed rail to link London with the Midlands cities of Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester will generate significant opportunities for growth in demand for power solutions to upgrade and replace current infrastructure, both in rolling stock and track side controls. Relec’s current relationships and track record for supplying power solutions to the U.K. rail industry position GWW ideally to capitalize on these ongoing refurbishment and expansion efforts. A similarly robust market in the medical power supply markets with a CAGR at 6.9%, to reach $1.8 billion in 2025, creates tremendous growth opportunities for our Relec subsidiary in the U.K. The coronavirus pandemic has put healthcare and the medical device industry front and center in the U.S., Europe and Asia, fueling intense interest in the power electronics and display solutions that Relec distributes.
 
We sell products to our OEM customers through direct sales or through our sales channels, including manufacturers’ representatives for our Gresham Power subsidiary. Our sales strategy is to identify and focus on strategic accounts. This strategy allows us to maintain a close and direct relationship with such accounts, which positions us as the supplier of choice for these customers’ challenging, innovative and demanding new product requirements.
 
Commercial Customers. We serve global commercial markets including transportation, medical, telecom, and industrial companies. Our products are used in a variety of applications and operate in a broad range of systems where customers require mission critical power reliability and occasionally extreme environmental conditions.

Competition
 
The markets in which Microphase operates is highly competitive and sensitive to technological advances. Many of Microphase’s competitors are larger than it is and maintain higher levels of expenditures for research and development. Principal competitive factors in Microphase’s markets are product quality and reliability; technological capabilities; service; past performance; ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; ability to meet delivery schedules; the effectiveness of third-party sales channels in international markets; and cost-effectiveness.
 
In the RF Communications market, principal competitors for filter components products include K& L Microwave, a Dover company located in Salisbury, MD; RS Microwave, a privately held company headquartered in Butler, NJ; Lorch Microwave of Salisbury, MD, a member of the Smith Group, a global technology company listed on the London Stock Exchange; and Delta Diversified Products, a private company based in Arizona.
 
In the video amplifier segment, principal competitors for DLVA sensor products include American Microwave Corporation, a privately held company headquartered in Frederick, MD; Akon Inc., a privately held company based in San Jose, CA; Planar Monolithics Industries, a privately held company based in Frederick, MD; L-3 Narda-Miteq, a subsidiary of L-3 Communications Inc., a publicly traded company based in New York, NY; and Signal Technology, a subsidiary of Crane Co., a publicly traded company based in Stamford, CT.
 
Our Enertec subsidiary faces direct competition from smaller firms than itself such as Nir Or, EPS, MER, Alexander Schneider, Symcotech and Chaban, which specialize in components of electronic solutions. Offering end-to-end, turnkey solutions gives Enertec a competitive advantage over other private contractors competing to provide the Israeli Ministry of Defense and major OEMs with electronic systems and components. That competitive advantage results in a significant portion of Enertec’s business being de facto “sole source” work without other viable competition.
 
Gresham Power confronts competition from Ultra Electronics and Rolls Royce. As in the case of Microphase, elegant designs, strong engineering and a long track record for delivering ultra-reliable high quality power electronics solutions enables Gresham Power to compete effectively.
 
Relec competes against many other distributors of power electronics and display offerings, facing competition from the likes of Fidus Power Ltd, Mouser Electronics and Avnet Abacus as well as power supply and electronics manufacturers like XP and ABB who sell direct, many of which have significantly more fiscal and marketing resources than Relec. However, a high touch, customer-focused approach enables Relec to compete effectively against high volume distributors and direct selling manufacturers. Optimizing and designing solutions into customer product lines has proven tremendously effective in building relationships with customers and suppliers alike that endure over time, generating regular repeat business and builds a reputation for customer service that provides a strong competitive advantage when pursuing new customers.

We also face competition from current and prospective customers who may decide to design and manufacture power electronics, communications components and electronic solutions needed to satisfy their internal programmatic requirements.
 
Consolidation in the defense technology solutions market, including through mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances among major entities to which we sell our products, has the potential to intensify the competitive pressures that we face. Many of our existing and potential competitors may be better positioned than we are to acquire other companies, technologies or products. We believe we compete favorably on the basis of multiple factors, including product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, service, past performance, design flexibility and ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions customized to our customers’ needs, and cost-effectiveness. Focusing on bespoke technology offerings with relatively low volumes and high margins enables our operating subsidiaries to compete favorably on price against larger companies with much high indirect cost structures. Finally, the fragmentation of the defense technology market also creates opportunities for GWW to grow through acquiring competitors and/or potential competitors.
 
Compliance with Material Government (Including Environmental) Regulations
 
ACS
 
ACS is subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. ACS continually assesses compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. While ACS’s regulatory compliance costs are currently not considered material, it is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of ongoing monitoring.
 
The Facility is subject to a final corrective measures plan with the Environment Protection Agency. The seller performed remedial activities at the Facility relating to historical soil and groundwater contamination and ACS is responsible for ongoing monitoring and final remediation plans. We estimate cost of the environmental remediation obligation is approximately $369,000 and reflects our best estimate of probable future costs for remediation based on the current assessment data and regulatory obligations. Future costs will depend on many factors, including the extent of work necessary to implement monitoring and final remediation plans and ACS’s time frame for remediation. We may incur actual costs in the future that are materially different than this estimate and such costs could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows during the period in which they are recorded.
 
TOGI
 
TOGI’s businesses are heavily regulated in most of its markets. TOGI handles power electronics products mainly in the form of power conversion. TOGI must take into account several standards for electronic safety to protect the health of humans and animals. TOGI serves diverse markets including automotive, defense/aerospace, medical/healthcare, industrial and telecommunications, each of which has its own set of their safety regulations and standard that TOGI must comply with.
Government Contracts. The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of TOGI’s government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of TOGI’s U.S. Government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, TOGI would generally be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of TOGI’s government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. Government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require TOGI to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government can also hold TOGI liable for damages resulting from the default.
 
Medical device power supplies. TOGI’s medical power supplies must incorporate one or more means of protection (“MOP”) to avoid electrocution. A MOP can be safety insulation, a protective earth, a defined creepage distance, an air gap (clearance) or other protective impedance. These can be used in various combinations - having two MOPs means if one fails, there is another in place. A MOP can be achieved through safety insulation, protective earth, a defined creepage distance, an air gap, other protective impedances, or by implementing a combination of these techniques. TOGI must comply with a standard that treats operators and patients, resulting in the classifications “means of operator protection” and “means of patient protection.” The latter requirements are more stringent because the patient may be physically connected via an applied part and unconscious when the fault occurs.

Environmental. TOGI is subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. TOGI continually assesses its compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure that its operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of TOGI’s operations.
 
Non-U.S. Sales. TOGI’s non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
 
GWW
 
GWW’s businesses are heavily regulated in most of its markets. GWW transacts with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”), branches of the U.S. military and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exercise similar regulatory oversight in GWW’s non-U.S. markets.
Government Contracts. The governments of the U.S., U.K. and Israel may terminate any of GWW’s applicable operating subsidiaries’ government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If the U.S. Government terminated any of GWW’s contracts for convenience, GWW generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of GWW’s government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require GWW to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government can also hold GWW liable for damages resulting from the default. Similar provisions apply to GWW’s contracts with other governments and to GWW’s subcontractors with major defense contractors who provide systems or military platforms directly to the government.
Power Electronics. In all of GWW’s markets in the U.S., GWW’s commercial power electronics offerings must comply with safety, energy use and operational performance regulations and standards (IEC/EN/UL/CSA) issued and administered by international standards organizations. In the U.S., the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Communications Commission mandate and enforce compliance with these standards. Outside the U.S., various government agencies in the U.K., Europe and Israel mandate and enforce compliance with these international requirements for safety, energy use and operational performance. In commercial markets, GWW’s suppliers bear most of the expense of compliance with international standards as a standard cost of business. Given the universal application of these requirements, the costs of compliance do not create any competitive disadvantage because all competitors must comply to sell into the market.
Environmental. GWW must meet applicable regulatory, environmental, emissions, safety and other requirements where its customer specifies, or as applicable local regulations or laws require. The products that GWW markets and sells in Europe also may be subject to the 2003 European Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), which restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of certain electronic and electrical equipment, as well as the 2002 European Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”), which determines collection, recycling and recovery goals for electrical goods. In July 2006, GWW’s industry began phasing in RoHS and WEEE requirements in most geographical markets with specific emphasis on consumer-based products. GWW believes that RoHS and WEEE-compliant components may be subject to longer lead-times and higher prices as the industry transitions to these new requirements. REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Registration) is a European Union regulation dating from 18 December 2006. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.
 
These regulatory mandates apply to all of GWW’s operating subsidiaries. GWW has structured operations to comply with these requirements and have experienced little to no impact on lead times or prices. Give the applicability of these requirements to all competitors alike, compliance has had no impact on the competitive position of any operating subsidiary.

Non-U.S. Sales. GWW’s non-U.S. sales are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and repatriation of earnings. Non-U.S. sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
 
Security Clearance
 
As a U.S. Government contractor working on classified projects, Microphase is required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with the DoD and other federal agency requirements. Microphase maintains strict protocols for handling classified information and Confidential Unclassified Information (“CUI”) associated with its work for the DoD and has built a secure restricted area within its Shelton production facility certified for generating, storing and reviewing classified information.
 
Gresham Power works on many contracts classified as “Official Sensitive” that require individual security clearances and adherence to information security protocols for receiving, handling and storing confidential information as required in the U.K. Official Secrets Act and its implementing regulations.
 
Enertec complies with all information security requirements included in their customer contracts as well as all the confidentiality laws that the State of Israel mandates for work related to defense of the country.
 
Audits and Investigations
 
As a government contractor, we are subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government agencies including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (the “DCAA”), the Defense Contract Management Agency (the “DCMA”), the Inspector General of the DoD and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the DOJ and Congressional Committees. From time-to-time, these and other agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether a contractor’s operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. The DCAA and DCMA also review the adequacy of, and compliance with, a contractor’s internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. Government. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government.
 
Enertec conducts operations under constant supervision of the Ministry of Defense of Israel and the contractors through which the Ministry of Defense does most of its business. All its contracts are subject to audits of performance, quality and price reasonableness.
 
Gresham Power contracts with the U.K. Ministry of Defence, Royal Navy or major defense contractors serving those agencies include standard provisions which give the customer the right to audit our performance under those contracts when they see fit. Audits are part of doing business with the government and typically focus on deliveries – on time project milestones as well as quality. The Royal Navy will review Gresham Power pricing of services provided under support contract every 12 months for reasonableness.
 
The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, as implemented in standard contract clauses, mandates that Microphase establish and follow extensive detailed processes and protocols to protect classified information and CUI from disclosure and unauthorized access. That mandate includes a requirement that Microphase formulate and implement a system security plan with 110 different elements and protocols for handling and protecting classified information and CUI. Over the next three years, the DoD will require all participants in the defense supply chain to demonstrate compliance with the Capability Model Maturity Cybersecurity as verified through an independent third-party auditor. Compliance with these mandates requires and will require Microphase to invest significant resources to maintain compliance. For instance, compliance requires extensive security controls on access to Microphase information technology systems, strong firewalls and intrusion monitoring. Microphase will have to hire a full-time person to ensure information security and act as a Facility Security Officer as well as oversee security of all Microphase employees. These investments add to indirect cost pools that Microphase must recover in the price of its products for DoD and contractors.
 
Gresham Power Electronics Ltd is fully certified as “Cyber Essentials Plus Compliant.” Cyber Essentials Plus is a government-backed, industry-supported scheme to help organizations protect themselves against common online threats. The UK Government requires all suppliers bidding for contracts involving the handling of sensitive and personal information to be certified against the Cyber Essentials Plus program criteria.

Enertec has implemented the strongest possible cyber security protections consistent with the resources available to a company its size.
 
Other Compliance Matters
 
In addition, we are subject to the local, state and national laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we operate that affect companies generally, including laws and regulations governing commerce, intellectual property, trade, health and safety, contracts, privacy and communications, consumer protection, web services, tax, and corporate laws and securities laws. These regulations and laws may change over time. Unfavorable changes in existing and new laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and impede our growth.
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we spent approximately $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, on research and development.
 
Human Capital Resources 
 
We are committed to attracting and retaining the brightest and best talent, so investing in human capital is critical to our success. The employee traits we value include industriousness, intellectual curiosity, growth mindset and deeply caring about the quality of work. The human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business include employee safety, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
 
The following description provides an overall view of our Company. Since we are a holding company, however, every statement may not be applicable to every subsidiary, particularly since some are located in foreign countries and others operate in industries deemed essential by the DoD and therefore remained at work during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Employee Profile
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 323 employees located in the U.S., the U.K. and Israel, of whom 44 were engaged in engineering and product development, 35 in sales and marketing, 175 in general operations and 69 in general administration and finance. All but 10 of these employees are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees is currently represented by a trade union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 45% of our current workforce is female, 55% male, and our average tenure is 6.2 years, a decrease of 38% from an average tenure of 10 years as of December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the addition of 102 employees related to our hotel operations acquired in December 2021.
 
Talent
 
A core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and commitment in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset and our goals of a diverse and inclusive workforce. We believe that our average tenure of 6.2 years as of the end of the fiscal year 2021 reflects the engagement of our employees in this core talent system tenet.
 
The Company believes it materially complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

Employee Engagement and Development
 
Our employee engagement efforts include our frequent and transparent “all-hands” meetings and executive communications, through which we aim to keep our employees well-informed and to increase transparency. We believe in continual improvement and use employee feedback to drive and improve processes that support our customers and ensure a deep understanding of our employees' needs. We plan to conduct annual confidential employee surveys as we believe that ongoing performance feedback encourages greater engagement in our business and improves individual performance. Our employees will participate in a 360-degree evaluation process to identify critical capabilities for development and establish new stretch goals.
Pay Equity
 
Our employee compensation strategy supports three primary objectives: attract and retain the best team members; reflect and reinforce our most important values; and align team member interests with stockholder interests in building enduring value. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.
Total Rewards
 
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to healthy base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, family care resources and flexible work schedules. We established a Company matched 401(k) plan during 2021 and plan to establish a Company-wide augmented employee stock purchase plan in 2022.
Health and Safety
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having a significant portion of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
