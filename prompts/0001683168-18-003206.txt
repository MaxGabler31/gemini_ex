ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are engaged in the health care industry, principally focusing on supplying products and services related to the growing field of regenerative anti-aging medicine (“RAAM”). Our goal is to supply newly designed advanced biologically processed cellular and tissue-based products developed from internally-based research and development activities and/or from other state-of-the-art RAAM-related products developed by third parties under exclusive and/or favorable supply arrangements and to provide other related services used in the growing health care field of regenerative medicine (“RAAM Products”). We intend to distribute the RAAM Products and market RAAM-related services to the health care industry and a referral network of doctors and clinics (collectively, the “Providers”).
 
From November 2016 to February 2018, we began operating our own laboratory facilities to process and distribute RAAM Products developed through trade secrets acquired in connection with the employment of newly hired executives during November 2016 and March 2017. During this time, we also implemented an in-house sales force and made arrangements with newly identified independent distributors to sell our RAAM Products.
 
As discussed more fully below, during February 2018, we sold or transferred our laboratory facilities and all related assets (“Sale”), including intellectual property rights, to Vera Acquisition LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“Vera”). During August 2018, Vera notified the Company that it was no longer in the business originally acquired in connection with the Sale and that it was no longer able to supply products to the Company under the Organicell Distribution Agreement (“Vera Exit”). As a result of the Vera Exit, the Company is currently relying on short-term supply agreements with other third party manufacturers to provide it with the products it currently distributes.
 
Background:
 
RAAM Products:
 
From July 2015 to October 2016, the Company’s main revenue stream was generated from referral fees and sales of products that were solely obtained through supply arrangements with third party manufacturers. Revenues from these activities during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016 did not increase as projected primarily due to the Company’s ongoing cash restraints which limited the ability of the Company to attract and retain sales related personnel and the level of advertising and social media marketing efforts that could be deployed towards increasing revenues. In addition, costs charged from the suppliers of the Company’s products were higher than projected due to the Company’s inability to provide certain minimum guaranteed purchase commitments, which further impacted the Company’s ability to attract distributors to supply and market its products, primarily due to the lower commissions that could be offered to the potential distributors as a result of the higher products costs and the Company’s need to achieve minimum gross margins, and the inability for the Company to negotiate terms with these suppliers to provide the Company with private labeling and/or granting of exclusive sales territories, factors important to many distributors. As a result of the above, the Company determined during November 2016 that it would immediately focus on implementing its strategy to develop products internally in order to effectively position itself and compete in the RAAM market, provide the Company with improved margins obtained on the sale of its products, and to increase revenues resulting from the ability to differentiate its products as superior to its competitors combined with leveraging existing marketing programs and strategies aimed to attract distributors and Providers.
 
In connection with this strategy, during November 2016, the Company announced additions to its executive management team, including Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Bruce Werber (“COO”); Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ian T. Bothwell (“CFO”); and Chief Science Officer, Dr. Maria Ines Mitrani (“CSO”), who joined Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Albert Mitrani. On March 8, 2017, the Company appointed Mr. Terrell Suddarth (“CTO”) as the Chief Technology Officer. Messrs. Mitrani, Werber, Bothwell, and Suddarth and Ms. Mitrani are collectively referred to as the “Management Team.” The Management Team provided the Company with significant industry, technical and financial related experience as the Company began the launch and expansion of the supply of newly developed innovative amnion placental tissue products.

During January 2017, Anu Life Sciences Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“ANU”), announced that it successfully completed several trial production runs of its first amnion placental tissue product (“New Amnio Product”). During February 2017, the Company received satisfactory validation for its first production batch of the New Amnio Product and commenced shipping the New Amnio Product to customers. Since the release of the New Amnio Product, ANU has developed other placental tissue derived products for commercial sale to Providers in the health care industry. ANU’s products developed were sold through ANU’s designated distributor and affiliate, General Surgical Florida Inc., a Florida corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“General Surgical”), under the name “Anu Rheo” and “Vendaje.”
 
Effective February 5, 2018 (“Closing Date”), Vera, Organicell, ANU and General Surgical, executed an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which ANU sold or transferred to Vera their right, title and interest in certain tangible and other assets associated with its manufacturing operations, including, prepaid expenses, raw and finished goods inventory, a long term lease for ANU’s laboratory facility in Sunrise, Florida (including associated security deposits), furniture and equipment, and certain intellectual property rights and General Surgical transferred its rights to certain third-party distribution agreements between General Surgical and distributors of products manufactured by ANU in exchange for a cash payment of $950,000 and execution of a long- term distribution agreement with Organicell (“Organicell Distribution Agreement”) which provided Organicell, or its designees, certain exclusive and non-exclusive rights to distribute future products to be manufactured by Vera, including products that were developed and produced by ANU prior to the Closing Date and additional products that may be developed and produced by Vera in the future. In connection with the Sale, Vera received credit for $100,000 previously paid by it to ANU for prepaid product supply which was not yet delivered to Vera as of the Closing Date. During August 2018, Vera notified the Company that it was no longer in the business originally acquired in connection with the Sale and that it was no longer able to supply products to the Company under the Organicell Distribution Agreement. As a result of the Vera Exit, the Company is currently relying on short-term supply agreements with third party manufacturers to provide it with the products it distributes.
 
In connection with the Sale, Vera arranged for the employment of the Company’s COO and CTO effective upon the closing of the Sale. In connection with such employment, the COO and CTO each entered into a Separation and General Release Agreement with the Company effective upon the closing of the Sale which provided for their immediate resignation from the Company and its subsidiaries, and the settlement of all obligations of each party to the other pursuant to the respective employment agreements, including the release of all rights the Company may have held in any intellectual property of the COO and CTO and any non-compete restrictions on the COO and CTO. In connection with such releases, each of the COO and CTO agreed to forfeit all warrants previously granted and outstanding (a total of 77,150,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company), forfeit any and all accrued and unpaid amounts owing under the employment agreements for past due wages, benefits, severance obligations, unreimbursed expenses and any other obligations owing to one another as of the date of the Closing Date in exchange for a grant of 7,500,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company (valued at $0.011 per share, the closing price of the common stock of the Company on the date of the Sale) to each of the COO and CTO.
 
The Company’s decision to sell the assets comprising the manufacturing operations operated by ANU was made in order to mitigate the substantial ongoing operating risks associated with the operations of the manufacturing facility, including (a) the lack of adequate working capital which prevented the ability of the Company to pay wages to any of its key executives since November 2016, and the looming realization that the services of the key executives would not remain indefinitely without additional funding, (b) the lack of working capital which prevented the ability of the Company to hire additional sales and manufacturing personnel and other critically needed staff and to make required payments to vendors, (c) existing and newly issued FDA guidelines released in November 2017 governing ANU’s manufacturing operations that were projected to require significant additional capital resources to be deployed to satisfactorily meet regulatory requirements within specified deadlines, (d) continuing difficulties to demonstrate to the Company’s current and potential distributors and customers of the Company’s financial stability and ability to remain a going concern and in compliance with FDA guidelines, important considerations of distributors and customers in selecting suppliers for the products which were being manufactured and supplied by ANU, and (e) the concern over the ability to make the upcoming principal and interest payments due on the Company’s convertible promissory notes which were to become due and payable in full on March 29, 2018 or sooner, in the event of default. The convertible promissory notes were secured by all of the Company’s assets and any event of default in the future would have caused a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations.

After the completion of the Sale, the Company remains in the business of selling and distributing regenerative biologic therapies based on amnion placental tissue derived products to doctors and hospitals, but relies on supply arrangements with third-party manufacturers or indirectly from distributors of third-party manufacturers, rather than from products internally manufactured, for the supply of these advanced biologically processed cellular and tissue based products.
 
Since the Sale was completed, including the departure of several key executives, the Company had been unsuccessful in generating sufficient revenues and, as a result, continued to have a lack of working capital to meet current operating costs, hiring of additional sales personnel, pay past due accounts payable obligations to its vendors, pay past due and/or current salaries to its remaining management or fund potential growth opportunities. Because of such uncertainties, there still existed substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
On April 23, 2018, the Company and Management and Business Associates, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“MBA”), executed a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization (“Reorganization Plan”) whereby the Company agreed to issue to MBA an aggregate of 222,425,073 shares of its common stock of the Company, representing 51% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on fully-diluted basis, for $0.001 per share (or an aggregate of $222,425), in consideration for MBA’s founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Manuel Iglesias’ agreement to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of the Company. The Reorganization Plan was effective as of April 13, 2018 (“Effective Date”).
 
Prior to the execution and effectiveness of the Reorganization Plan, Mr. Iglesias moved from his position as Chief Executive Officer of MBA to a position as Co-Chairman of the Board of Hygea Holdings Corp., a Florida corporation (“Hygea”), a diversified healthcare holding company that owns physician practices, ancillary services companies (e.g., pharmacies, therapies and diagnostic facilities), independent physician associations (“IPAs”), and other medical service entities that provide seamless care to commercial, Medicare and Medicaid patients. As the newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Iglesias intends to bring his extensive industry experience and relationships to attract capital and industry leaders to the Company as the Company seeks to stabilize, expand and grow the business into becoming a leading supplier of services, products and therapies for the regenerative health care sector, including expansion into the rapidly growing wellness sector, and to pursue clinical studies and certifications for specific disease states using the expedited FDA program for regulatory approval for regenerative medicine advance therapies (“RMAT”). As part of the Company’s efforts to raise capital and reposition the Company’s image, the Company has recently initiated and/or completed several important corporate governance changes to simplify the Company’s capital structure and to attract investment capital including:
 

1. | On May 21, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to change the Company’s name from Biotech Products Services and Research, Inc. to Organicell Regenerative Medicine, Inc., effective June 20, 2018, in order to express more clearly the Company’s focus in the stem cell business (the “Name Change”). As discussed below, the Name Change has not been effectuated in the marketplace by FINRA.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | On May 21, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate a reverse stock split of one (1) new share for each seventeen (17) shares issued and outstanding as of the record date of May 21, 2018, with resulting fractional shares being rounded up to the nearest whole number, and a reduction in the authorized shares from 750 million to 250 million (the “Reverse Split”). On June 18, the Company filed a Certificate of Correction with the Secretary of State of Nevada to reverse the amendments related to the Reverse Split, and will file a new Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate the Reverse Split once the Reverse Split has been effectuated in the marketplace by FINRA.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Based on the current amount of common shares outstanding, after given effect to the Reverse Split, the amount of common shares outstanding of the Company will be reduced from 432,290,110 to 25,428,830. The Company believes the Reverse Split will bring value to the issued and outstanding shares of the Company by limiting dilution of operating results by an excessive number of shares overhanging the market. As discussed below, the Reverse Split has not been effectuated in the marketplace by FINRA.

3. | On June 14, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Withdrawal with the Secretary of State of Nevada, thereby withdrawing and terminating all previously issued designations of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The Company cancelled the Company’s authorized and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock in order to provide investors with greater confidence in the value to the issued and outstanding shares of the Company by limiting dilution of operating results and limitation on preferences granted to other investors.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The Company reached agreement with its key executive management in connection with the Reorganization Plan to terminate their prior employment agreements in favor of new employment agreements which reduce the overall minimum compensation burden to the Company.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | The Company reconstituted its Board of Directors and appointed an independent outside director.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On June 1, 2018, the Company submitted an Issuer Company-Related Notification Form (“June 1 Notification Form”) with the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency (“FINRA”) pursuant to Rule 10b-17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), regarding the Name Change and Reverse Split. However, due to the Company’s delinquency its Exchange Act reports with the SEC by failing to file this Annual Report and its Quarterly Reports for the quarters ended January 31, 2018 and April 30, 2018, FINRA did not announce or effectuate the Name Change or Reverse Split in the marketplace. FINRA has recently informed the Company that as a result of the length of time before the Company expects to file its delinquent Exchange Act reports with the SEC, a new Issuer Company-Related Notification Form will be required to be submitted for approval upon the Company becoming current in its Exchange Act filings. We intend to resubmit an Issuer Company-Related Notification Form with FINRA and we anticipate that FINRA will announce and effectuate the Name Change and Reverse Split in the marketplace at that time.
 
Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers:
 
In connection with the new regulations enacted as of November 8, 2016 by the Florida state legislature (“Amendment No. 2”) that permits Florida residents to apply to open Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (“MMTC”) for defined MMTC licensed activities, the Company entered into a Participation Agreement, effective February 14, 2017 (the “Agreement”), with Mr. Peter Taddeo (“Taddeo”) and Mr. Wayne Rohrbaugh (“Rohrbaugh”), two then non-affiliated accredited investors (collectively, the “Investors”) for the purpose of obtaining a Florida license and operating a business to dispense medical cannabis. Pursuant to the terms of the Participation Agreement, the Company formed and capitalized Mint Organics, Inc., a Florida corporation and a 55% owned subsidiary of the Company (“Mint Organics”), and Mint Organics Florida, Inc., a Florida corporation and a 96% owned subsidiary of Mint Organics (“Mint Organics Florida”), to explore, develop and to provide products and services in connection with the MMTC activities that they are licensed to operate.
 
Pursuant to Participation Agreement, Messrs. Taddeo and Rohrbaugh each invested $150,000 in the Company in exchange for the issuance to each of Taddeo and Rohrbaugh (a) 150 shares of Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock of Mint Organics (“Mint Series A Preferred Stock”), convertible into a 22.5% equity interest in the common stock of Mint Organics or within 90 days of the one year anniversary of the date of the Participation Agreement (May 14, 2018), into common stock of the Company at a future date based on the value of the Company’s common stock at the time of conversion, and (b) a warrant to acquire up to 150,000 shares of common stock of the Company, exercisable for three years at an exercise price of $0.15 per share. In connection with the Agreement, $150,000 of the proceeds received from the Investors was obligated to be used to fund the operations of Mint Organics, Inc. and/or Mint Organics Florida, Inc. and the remainder was to be used for working capital of the Company.
 
In connection with the Participation Agreement, on February 28, 2017, Mr. Taddeo was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and as a director of Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida and Mr. Rohrbaugh was appointed as the Chief Operating Officer and as a director of Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida. Also, on March 8, 2017, Mr. Taddeo was appointed as a member to the Board of Directors of the Company.

The Company initially believed that expanding into the MMTC industry, and being one of the first group of companies to be granted a license to operate within Florida, would provide significant opportunities for increasing overall revenues and growth for the Company. In addition, the growing science and research regarding the regenerative health benefits associated with the use of marijuana had certain synergies with the Company’s current RAAM operations and strategy to become a leading supplier of newly designed advanced biologically processed cellular and tissue based products and services used in the growing health care field of regenerative medicine.
 
As of October 31, 2017, Mint Organics had not been successful in obtaining a Florida license allowing Mint Organics or Mint Organics Florida to operate a business to dispense medical cannabis. In addition, Mint Organics had exhausted all of its working capital and Organicell was unable to identify additional sources of working capital.
 
On April 6, 2018, Mr. Taddeo resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and as the Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida. Mr. Taddeo’s resignation was due to his decision to pursue other personal objectives, particularly in light of the ongoing lack of adequate working capital at Mint Organics to demonstrate the ability to fund a reasonable level of future cash compensation to Mr. Taddeo and the additional capital required to sustain future efforts required to successfully pursue obtaining a license to operate cannabis dispensaries. In connection with Mr. Taddeo’s resignation, the Company and Mr. Taddeo entered into settlement agreement in connection with the termination of Mr. Taddeo’s employment agreement and the Company agreed to purchase from Mr. Taddeo his 150 shares of Mint Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $40,000. Effective May 14, 2018, the conversion rights for the holders of the Mint Series A Preferred Stock (or Class B Common Stock equivalent) to convert into unregistered shares, par value $0.001 per share, of common stock of Organicell had expired.
 
The Company has been evaluating viable alternatives regarding the future operations of Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida. Since the time that the Company began efforts to obtain a Florida license, the state of Florida has granted all of the number of licenses currently authorized to operate dispensaries to other competitors. The Company believes that there are currently many other entities competing to obtain licenses to operate dispensaries and that the limited number of licenses that are expected to be authorized and granted in the future will be to those companies with significantly more working capital and expertise than the Company.
 
Operating Subsidiaries:
 
For the year ended October 31, 2017, our RAAM-related operations were being conducted through the following wholly-owned subsidiaries*:
 

· | Anu Life Sciences, Inc., a Florida corporation formed with a business purpose to manufacture newly designed advanced biologically processed cellular and tissue based products developed from internally based research and development activities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Beyond Cells Corp., a Florida corporation formed with a business purpose to provide consumers with education regarding the field of regenerative and anti-aging and medicine and providing access to a specialized physician network (“Beyond Cells”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
* As described above, the manufacturing operations of ANU were sold during February 2018, and the Company now relies on supply arrangements with third-party manufacturers or indirectly from distributors of third-party manufacturers for the supply of RAAM products that are sold to Providers.
 
Our MMTC exploratory activities have been conducted through the following the following subsidiaries. As described above, effective April 6, 2018, Mr. Taddeo resigned as CEO of our MMTC subsidiaries. The Company has yet to replace Mr. Taddeo and the Company is evaluating its alternatives regarding the future operations of Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida **:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



** Mint Organics and Mint Organics Florida have issued minority non-voting equity interests.
 
We also have two wholly-owned subsidiaries that are inactive:
 

· | Ethan New York, Inc., a New York corporation formed with a business purpose of selling clothing and accessories through a retail store in New York City (“Ethan NY”) and for which operations ended in June 2016; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | BD Source and Distribution, Corp., a Florida corporation (“BD Source”) formed with a business purpose of selling cellular therapy products to doctors and hospitals and for which operations ended in October 2015. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



On September 3, 2015, Ethan NY entered into a five-year lease agreement (“Ethan Lease”) for a store located in New York City, New York (“Leased Premises”). During June 2016, Ethan NY exited from its Leased Premises. In connection with the lease exit, Ethan NY is negotiating with the landlord for settlement of past due amounts owing under the Ethan Lease and the release of all other obligations potentially owing under the Ethan Lease. Ethan NY has not made any of the required monthly lease payments since inception of the Ethan Lease. The total amount of minimum lease payments that Ethan NY is obligated to pay pursuant to this 5-year lease (the “Initial Term”) is $586,241 (excluding late fees and interest provided for under the Ethan Lease). All of Ethan NY’s obligations are recourse only to the assets at Ethan NY, except however, certain obligations under the Ethan Lease that were guaranteed by an outside party. Under the terms of the Ethan Lease, the obligations of the Ethan Lease may be mitigated based on the amount of any future rents that are received for the rental of the Leased Premises to other tenants during the Initial Term.
 
Industry Overview
 
Health Care Industry Overview:
 
The traditional health care industry in the United States is predominantly controlled by the rules of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) (wwws.cms.gov) and commercial health insurance companies. This control limits patients’ access to alternative medical therapies, that recent medical literature demonstrates highly beneficial outcomes in the field of anti-aging and regenerative medicine. Traditional allopathic medicine of health care provided to patients in the United States relies on government and commercial health insurance for payment of the costs associated with their day-to-day health care. Because of this close relationship, physicians must follow government and commercial insurers guidelines in order to stay in the plans and receive reimbursement. Physicians are restricted in their ability to expand the nature of the treatments provided beyond industry practices because of legal ramifications and/or lack of knowledge concerning protocol of cutting edge anti-aging and regenerative medical treatments.
 
Despite the above, anecdotal and medical literature has shown an increased demand by patients for access to alternative medical therapies and treatments. Patients are seeking these alternatives to traditional allopathic medicine, due to the adverse events associated with traditional pharmaceuticals, risks associated with surgeries, and that traditional medicine and insurers are not addressing wellness or preventive medicine sufficiently. To address a wide variety of aging issues, safe alternatives to pathologies, including access to other treatments and pharmaceuticals and to achieve beneficial “elective” health treatments, we intend utilize the latest regenerative technologies. These alternative pathways to date have had significant restrictions because of regulations imposed by the FDA, other regulatory bodies and insurers due to lack of randomized controlled studies, yet many published case series demonstrate safety and efficacy. Patients and consumers are looking to safe alternatives compared more traditional medicine, including the following:
 

· | Cellular/ Tissue based therapies

Services and Products
 
Since the change in control of our Company in June 2015 and change in the Company’s operations in July 2015, we have been engaged in the health care industry, principally focusing on supplying products and services related to the growing field of regenerative anti-aging medicine. Our goal is to supply newly designed advanced biologically processed cellular and tissue based products developed from internally based research and development activities and/or from other state-of-the-art RAAM-related products developed by third parties under exclusive supply arrangements and to provide other related services used in the growing health care field of regenerative medicine (“RAAM Products”). We intend to distribute the RAAM Products and market RAAM-related services to Providers, through our newly established in-house sales force and/or through arrangements with independent distributors.
 
For the period July 2015 through the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, our main revenue stream was generated from referral and product sales through our BD Source, General Surgical (fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 only) and Beyond Cells. We also generated revenue from our Ethan NY subsidiary beginning December 2015 until June 2016, when the lease for Ethan NY’s sole store location was terminated.

As of February 2017, we had begun manufacturing our first product of several future expected lines of RAAM-related products that are used to treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Prior to February 2017 and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, we obtained supplies of all the RAAM products we sold from third party tissue banks and resold them directly to Providers within our network. Since the Sale in February 2018 through the date of the Vera Exit, we obtained supplies of all the RAAM products we sold through the Organicell Distribution Agreement. Since the Vera Exit, we have obtained supplies of all the RAAM products we sold through supply arrangements with other third party suppliers, with no firm commitments or agreements in place.

In connection with the change in control of our Company in June 2015, there was a change in the Company’s management, board of directors and line of business. In connection with the change in control of our Company in April 2018, there was a change in the Company’s management and board of directors.
 
Since inception, we have incurred net operating losses. Losses have principally occurred as a result of our inability to increase and stabilize revenues which have remained insufficient as a result of a lack of working capital to (a) fund effectively the marketing of our products, (b) the ability to attract and retain needed personnel and/or (c) to fund the expansion into other growth opportunities, including the substantial resources required for research and development and clinical trials. We expect operating losses to continue. Our available funds combined with our current revenue levels will not fund current levels of ongoing general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. We expect to need additional financing to develop, produce, and/or market our products and to cover the general and administrative expenses of the Company.
 
The Company incurred a net loss of $9,112,519 for the year ended October 31, 2017. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $11,085,743 at October 31, 2017. The Company had a negative working capital position of $3,599,915 at October 31, 2017. To date, our capital needs have been mostly funded from the private sale of debt and equity to “accredited investors” under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Market Overview
 
The population of the United States and the developed world is getting older and living longer. According to a United States Consensus Bureau’s report, “An Aging World: 2015,” America’s 65-and-over population is projected to nearly double over the next three decades, ballooning from 48 million to 88 million by 2050 and that worldwide, the 65-and-over population will more than double to 1.6 billion by 2050. According to the report, in 2015, 14.9% of the U.S. population was 65 or over and the United States was the 48th oldest country out of 228 countries and areas in the world in 2015. Baby boomers began reaching age 65 in 2011 and by 2050 the older share of the U.S. population will increase to 22.1%.

The world average age of death has increased by 35 years since 1970, with declines in death rates in all age groups, including those aged 60 and older (Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2013; Mathers et al., 2015). The leading causes of death are shifting, in part because of increasing longevity. Between 1990 and 2013, the number of deaths from non-communicable diseases (“NCDs”) has increased by 42%; and the largest increases in the proportion of global deaths took place among the population aged 80 and over. An estimated 42.8% of deaths worldwide occur in the population aged 70 and over, with 22.9% in the population aged 80 and over.
 
Also, according to the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), “Medical Tourism” (a term commonly used to describe people traveling outside their home country for medical treatment) is a worldwide, multibillion-dollar phenomenon that is expected to grow substantially in the next 5–10 years. Studies have estimated that hundreds of thousands of medical tourists travel from the United States annually and that patients pursue medical care abroad for a variety of reasons, including a desire to receive a procedure or therapy not available in their country of residence. Common categories of procedures that US travelers pursue during medical tourism trips include orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, cardiology (cardiac surgery), oncologic care, and dentistry. Common destinations include Thailand, Mexico, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, and Costa Rica.
 
If we are able to implement our intended business plan, we believe that we will be well situated to address this increased consumer demand for alternative medical treatments.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Currently, we market our RAAM products and services to a network of Providers through in-house, contracted sales personnel and/or from independent distributors. As of October 31, 2017, we had five sales people who marketed our RAAM products and services by using social media outlets, medical conferences and seminars and from development of prior and newly identified Providers and related professional relationships. In addition, we had arrangements with several independent distributors that were marketing and distributing our products. We intend in the future to expand our in-house sales force and independent distributors as our working capital improves, our product line expands and as volumes increase. We also intend to develop and offer ongoing training seminars to provide the best possible information on the latest advances on anti-aging, and regenerative medicine to Providers.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Currently, we purchase all of our RAAM Products through supply arrangements directly with third-party manufacturers or indirectly from distributors of other third-party manufacturers. Since the date of the Sale and up through the date of the Vera Exit, we purchased all of our RAAM Products through the Organicell Distribution Agreement. Since February 2017 and up through the date of the Sale on February 5, 2018, we internally manufactured our RAAM Products and acquired raw materials and supplies for our RAAM research and development and the manufacturing of our RAAM placental-related products from unaffiliated third-party laboratories pursuant to purchase orders or distribution agreements (“Supply Arrangements”).
 
In the event any one or more of our current suppliers are unwilling or unable to sell us required products, for any reason, we may not be able to provide replacement products to our customers, or if other supply arrangements can be made, the replacement products and terms may not be as favorable.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
Our RAAM business is not dependent on any one or more customers. We expect that our customer and consumers will be broad based and throughout the United States and worldwide.

Competition
 
The regenerative medicine field is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and regulation. Companies compete on the basis of product efficacy, pricing, and ease of handling/logistics. A critically important factor for growth in the US market is third-party reimbursement, which is difficult to obtain, it can be time-consuming and expensive. We expect that it will take some time before RAAM products will be widely accepted under health insurance coverage. In addition, growth of this industry is expected to expand as additional research and development into the benefits of regenerative products and specific products becomes more widely accepted as a result of FDA mandated or optional clinical trials are performed by industry stakeholders.
 
We intend to perform clinical trials for our RAAM Products for the purpose of obtaining biologics license status from the FDA to provide us with advantages over our competitors, including acceleration for acceptance of our products in traditional insurance plans, compliance with FDA regulations and to provide our customers with superior education and support of the benefits of our products. Initially we are positioning ourselves as a cash based health care alternative for consumers that can provide higher levels of improvement, that is not available from traditional allopathic medicine at this time.
 
The Company competes in multiple areas of clinical treatment where regenerative biomaterials may be employed to modulate inflammation, enhance healing and reduce scar tissue formation: advanced wound care treatment, spine, orthopedic, surgery and sports medicine.
 
The primary competitive products in this space include other amniotic membrane allografts, tissue-engineered living skin equivalents, and porcine- or bovine-derived collagen matrix products, cadaveric engineered bone grafts, tendon and fascial grafts among others. Our competitors include MiMedix Group, Inc., Organogenesis Inc., TissueTech (“Amniox”), Osiris, and BioD (“dermaSciences”). Additionally, there are a variety of accredited bone and soft tissue banks that we will be competing against.
 
As stated previously, the demand for RAAM products is very high and expected to grow with the growing baby boomer generation getting older, the increase in patients desiring to seek health care options outside of traditional therapies, the growing trend in the desire of individuals to remain active longer in life and the ongoing rise in health care costs which RAAM products may provide a more efficient and economical alternative for certain conditions.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s operations are subject to FDA regulations in connection with the sales and distribution of its RAAM products, the Company’s reliance on supply agreements with manufacturers that are required to comply with FDA regulations, the Company’s reliance on third party distributors for the supply of RAAM products and/or the Company’s intended objectives to conduct research and development and clinical trials of RAAM products. We anticipate these regulations will be heavily enforced and subject to more restrictive regulations by the FDA in the future. A summary of the current FDA regulations is set forth below:
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Tissue Products
 
The products that are sold by the Company are derived from human tissue and currently manufactured and processed by third party manufacturers. As discussed below, some tissue-based products are regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which do not require premarket clearance or approval by the FDA. Other tissue products are regulated as biologics and, in order to be lawfully marketed in the United States, require an FDA-approved BLA.
 
The FDA is continually changing and formulating new guidelines for this industry. In addition, the FDA has published some additional draft guidelines related to this industry and the ultimate form of the regulations are not yet known.
 
Products Regulated as HCT/Ps
 
The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. HCT/Ps that meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (so-called “361 HCT/Ps”) are not subject to approval requirements and they are subject to post-market regulatory requirements.
 




15
--

 

To be a 361 HCT/P, a product generally should meet following criteria:
 

· | Be minimally manipulated, no structural change, or be mixed with anything;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Be intended for homologous use, essentially used for the same purpose that it was used in the donor;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Its manufacture must not involve combination with another article, except for water, crystalloids or a sterilizing, preserving or storage agent; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | It must not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Products Regulated as Biologics- The BLA Pathway
 
The typical steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biologic product in the U.S. include:
 

· | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulations studies under the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application for marketing the product, which includes, among other things, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Generally, clinical trials are conducted in three phases:
 

· | Phase I trials typically involve a small number of healthy volunteers and are designed to provide information about the product safety.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II trials are conducted in a larger but limited group of patients afflicted with a specific diagnosis in order to determine preliminary efficacy, and to identify possible adverse effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Dosage studies are designated as Phase IIA and efficacy studies are designated as Phase IIB.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients who have a specific condition in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In some cases, the FDA will require Phase IV, or post-marketing trials, to collect additional data after a product is on the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The process of obtaining an approved BLA requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete.

FDA Post-Market Regulation
 
Tissue processors are required to register as an establishment with the FDA. We intend on becoming a registered establishment, accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) for the storage and distribution of tissue products that we purchase directly or indirectly from third party manufacturers. Once we are registered we will be required to comply with regulations, including those regulations regarding storage, controls, access, labeling, record keeping, security, processes, compliance with established Good Tissue Practices, and documentation associated with the sale of our products by our customers to their patients. Our facilities will be subject to periodic inspections to assess our records and determination of our compliance with the regulations.
 
Products covered by a BLA, 510(k) clearance, or a PMA are subject to numerous additional regulatory requirements, which include, among others, compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, and additional adverse event reporting.
 
Other Regulation Specific to Tissue Products
 
The AATB, has issued operating standards for tissue banking, whether manufacturing and/or storing products as a distributor of manufactured products by third parties. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become a licensed tissue bank.
21st Century Cures Act 
 
During December 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Act”) into law. The Act includes many provisions that aim to speed up the process of bringing new drugs and devices to market. One of the Act’s most significant amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act will allow the FDA to grant accelerated approval to regenerative medicine products, while also providing the agency with wide discretion on creating new approaches to regenerative medicine. This legislative development is the result of increased pressure from patients and other stakeholders to move regenerative medicine advancements more quickly from the lab into the clinic.
 
Specifically, the new accelerated approval pathway authorized by the Act allows certain regenerative medicine products to be designated as “regenerative advanced therapy” and become eligible for priority review by FDA. To qualify for this pathway, the product must be aimed at a serious disease and have the potential to deal with currently unmet medical needs. It must also meet the Act’s new definition of a regenerative advanced therapy, which is defined as “cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.” This broad definition would seem to encompass the majority of regenerative medicine products known to be currently in the development stages.
 
As with the existing accelerated approval pathway for drugs and biologics, this new regulatory pathway would allow a regenerative medicine product to be approved for marketing based on surrogate or intermediate clinical trial endpoints rather than longer term clinical outcomes. The use of such endpoints can decrease the number, duration, and complexity of clinical trials that are needed to prove a longer-term outcome. Subsequently, a sponsor would have to conduct confirmatory clinical trials to ensure that the surrogate or intermediate endpoint was in fact predictive of patients’ clinical response to the product, otherwise the accelerated approval could be withdrawn.

The Act also requires the FDA to work with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and other stakeholders to develop standards and consensus definitions for regenerative medicine products. Such standards are expected to play a large role in advancing this nascent industry by allowing companies to rely on FDA-recognized standards, rather than creating and validating their own as is the case today. 
 
The Act attempts to create a research network and a public-private partnership to assist developers in generating definitive evidence about whether their proposed therapies indeed provide clinical benefits that are hoped for. The Act also requires the FDA to track and report the number and type of applications filed for regenerative medicine products, including the number of products approved through the new accelerated approval pathway. The law also includes provisions that require the FDA to publish guidance on how it will design and implement an approval process for regenerative medicine devices.
 
Recently Announced November 2017 FDA Guidelines:
 
In November 2017, the FDA released four guidance documents (two final, two draft) in an effort to implement a “comprehensive policy framework” for existing laws and regulations governing regenerative medicine products, including human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). These guidance documents build upon the previous regulatory framework for these products, which was completed in 2005. A guidance document cannot alter a regulation, but can clarify how the FDA intends to enforce the regulation. The Comprehensive regenerative medicine policy framework intends to spur innovation, efficient access to potentially transformative products, while ensuring safety & efficacy.
 
The framework builds upon the FDA’s existing risk-based regulatory approach to more clearly describe what products are regulated as drugs, devices, and/or biological products. Further, two of the guidance documents propose an efficient, science-based process for helping to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these therapies, while supporting development in this area. The suite of guidance documents also defines a risk-based framework for how the FDA intends to focus its enforcement actions against those products that raise potential significant safety concerns. This modern framework is intended to balance the agency’s commitment to safety with mechanisms to drive further advances in regenerative medicine so innovators can bring new, effective therapies to patients as quickly and safely as possible. The policy also delivers on important provisions of the Act.
 
New Final Guidance Documents
 
The two final guidance documents clarify the FDA’s interpretation of the risk-based criteria manufacturers use to determine whether a product is subject to the FDA’s premarket review.
 
The first guidance provides greater clarity around when cell and tissue-based products would be excepted from the established regulations if they are removed from and implanted into the same individual within the same surgical procedure and remain in their original form. The second final guidance helps stakeholders better understand how existing regulatory criteria apply to their products by clarifying how the agency interprets the existing regulatory definitions “minimal manipulation” and “homologous use.” As this field advances, the FDA has noted that there are a growing number of regenerative medicine products subject to FDA premarket authorization. These guidance documents will help explain how the FDA will provide a risk-based framework for its oversight. The policy framework defines how the FDA intends to take action against unsafe products while facilitating continued innovation of promising technologies.
 
To accomplish this goal, the guidance document has clarified the FDA’s view of “minimal manipulation” and “homologous use.” These are two concepts that are defined in current regulation to establish the legal threshold for when a product is subject to the FDA’s premarket approval requirements. By further clarifying these terms in the final guidance, the FDA is applying a modern framework for its oversight.

FDA regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 1271, previous draft guidance documents, and untitled letters establish the agency’s approach to regulating HCT/Ps. Some HCT/Ps are exempt from premarket approval and are subject to regulation solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”) (so-called “361 HCT/Ps”) whereas others require premarket approval (i.e., as a drug, device, or biologic) (so-called “351 HCT/Ps”). Both 361 HCT/Ps and 351 HCT/Ps are subject to FDA requirements (at Part 1271) for registration and listing, donor-eligibility, current good tissue practices, and other requirements intended to prevent transmission of communicable diseases. Those that are the subject of the “same surgical procedure” exception – are exempt from both premarket approval requirements and the requirements of Part 1271. This regime is outlined in a flow chart, which is one of the few new features of the final guidance documents and is presented below:
 

Enforcement Discretion
 
Under the new policy, in order to allow manufacturers of products time to comply with the requirements, for the first 36 months following the issuance of the final guidance document the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for certain products that are subject to the FDA’s premarket review under the existing regulations, but are not currently meeting these requirements. The FDA does not intend to exercise such enforcement discretion for those products that pose a potential significant safety concern. Going forward, the FDA will apply a risk-based approach to enforcement, taking into account how products are being administered as well as the diseases and conditions for which they are being used. This risk-based approach allows product manufacturers time to engage with the FDA, as to determine if they need to submit a marketing authorization application and, if so, submit their application to the FDA for approval.

Although the FDA has not changed its basic approach to regulating HCT/Ps, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for 36 months with regard to 351 HCT/Ps requiring premarket approval. The guidance states that, in order to “give manufacturers time to determine if they need to submit an IND or marketing application in light of this guidance,” the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion (i.e., the Agency may permit marketing without an approved marketing application) if the HCT/P “is intended for autologous use and its use does not raise reported safety concerns or potential significant safety concerns.” 
 
The FDA has indicated it intends to focus enforcement actions on “products with higher risk,” taking into account factors such as non-autologous (allogeneic) use, the route of administration, the site of administration, and whether the product is intended for homologous or non-homologous use. For example, HCT/Ps administered via intravenous injection or infusion, aerosol inhalation, intraocular injection, or injection or infusion into the central nervous system, will be prioritized over HCT/Ps administered by intradermal, subcutaneous, or intra-articular injection. Similarly, HCT/Ps intended for non-homologous use, particularly those intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, “are more likely to raise significant safety concerns than HCT/Ps intended for homologous use”.
 
The Company believes that the new regulatory restrictions being implemented by the FDA are intended to assure that all parties involved in the chain of gathering, processing, distributing and/or administrating RAAM related products have met the required standards to assure that the manufacturing, marketing the administration of the RAAM regulated products are not misleading and are performed in a safe and ethical manner and in accordance with the “objective intent” of the manufacturer.
 
New Draft Guidance Documents
 
The two draft guidances provide important information to help spur development and access to innovative regenerative therapies. The first draft guidance, which builds off the regenerative medicine provisions in the Act, addresses how the FDA intends to simplify and streamline its application of the regulatory requirements for devices used in the recovery, isolation, and delivery of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, including combination products. The guidance specifies that devices intended for use with a specific RMAT may, together with the RMAT, be considered to comprise a combination product.
 
The second draft guidance describes the expedited programs that may be available to sponsors of regenerative medicine therapies, including the new Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation created by the 21st Century Cures Act, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval. In addition, the guidance describes the regenerative medicine therapies that may be eligible for RMAT designation – including cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, as well as gene therapies that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues (including genetically modified cells).
 
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
 
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. (See 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b). Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.”  These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute.

AdvaMed has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. We have incorporated the principles of the AdvaMed Code in our standard operating procedures, sales force training programs, and relationships with health care professionals.
 
Manufacturing (Processing)
 
During November 2016, we opened our first placental tissue bank processing laboratory in Miami, Florida. On June 20, 2017, we relocated our placental tissue bank processing laboratory to a larger “good manufacturing practice” (“GMP”) laboratory in Sunrise, Florida. During February 2018, we sold our manufacturing assets to a third party in connection with the Sale.
 
Currently the products we sell to our customers are delivered directly to them by the manufacturer of the products. We intend on becoming a registered establishment, accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) for the storage and distribution of tissue products that we purchase directly or indirectly from third party manufacturers.
 
Our facilities are expected to be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities based on the activities we may be engaged, and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies based on our operations. We intend to seek American Association Blood Banks (“AABB”) or AATB accreditation in connection with the storage of products we intend to distribute.
 
Placental Donation Program
 
During the time we operated our laboratory facilities, we purchased placental tissue that was used in our minimally manipulated 361 compliant process to produce allografts to be used in regenerative therapy specialties. During this time, we were able to procure an adequate supply of tissue to meet our anticipated demand.
Environmental Laws
 
As a result of the Sale in February 2018, we no longer process or directly handle biomedical materials. We currently arrange for the shipments of the products sold to our customers to be delivered directly from the product manufacturers. As a result of the above, we currently do not expect to have exposure for environmental related wastes in connection with our operations. In the future we intend to obtain a tissue bank license to store and distribute products from our facilities. Upon such time that we are performing these operations, if at all, we may become exposed to biomedical materials and related wastes. 
 
If we receive and/or generate any wastes that are required to be disposed, we plan on contracting with third parties for the transport, treatment, and disposal of the waste that we obtain and at all times plan on being compliant with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies.
 
Employees
 
At October 31, 2017, we had eight full-time employees and no part-time employees. We also engaged one other person as a consultant, assisting with sales. During the year ended October 31, 2017, we also engaged an outside consultant for accounting and bookkeeping services as well as other consultants that assisted with various administrative activities. In connection with the Sale, three of our full-time employees and one independent sales consultant resigned. In addition, during April 2018, one employee at Mint Organics also resigned. In connection with the Reorganization Plan in April 2018, we appointed a new employee to be our Chief Executive Officer and during June 2018 hired an additional employee for our sales department. During October 2018, the Company’s bookkeeper resigned. There are no collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, the Company engages independent contractors for sales and administration activities.

Corporate History and Change in Control
