ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
nVent Electric plc is a leading global provider of electrical connection and protection solutions. We believe our inventive electrical solutions enable safer systems and ensure a more secure world. We design, manufacture, market, install and service high performance products and solutions that connect and protect some of the world’s most sensitive equipment, buildings and critical processes. We offer a comprehensive range of enclosures, electrical fastening solutions and thermal management solutions across industry-leading brands that are recognized globally for quality, reliability and innovation. 
Our broad range of products and solutions connect and protect our customers’ mission-critical equipment from hazardous conditions, improving their utilization, lowering costs and minimizing downtime. The cost of our products typically represents a small proportion of the total cost of our customers’ end systems. We also are a small cost relative to the potential cost of failure that our products help avoid. We have a portfolio of premier, industry-leading brands, including nVent CADDY, ERICO, HOFFMAN, RAYCHEM, SCHROFF and TRACER, some of which have a history spanning over 100 years, that cover a wide range of verticals, including Industrial, Commercial & Residential, Energy and Infrastructure. 
Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "nVent," the "Company," and such words as "we," "us," and "our" include nVent Electric plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our principal office is in London, United Kingdom and our management office in the United States ("U.S.") is in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company was incorporated in Ireland on May 30, 2017. Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and have our tax residency in the U.K.
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
On April 30, 2018, Pentair plc ("Pentair") completed the separation of its Water business and its Electrical business into two independent, publicly-traded companies (the "separation"). To effect the separation, Pentair distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of nVent for every ordinary share of Pentair held as of the record date of April 17, 2018. As a result of the distribution, nVent became an independent publicly-traded company and began trading under the symbol "NVT" on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018. 
Our roots within Pentair trace back to the acquisition of Federal-Hoffman Corporation in 1988, which included the nVent HOFFMAN enclosures brand. From that starting point, we have grown both organically and via acquisition. Our Enclosures business first applied lean principles within the organization in the 1990s, leveraging its culture of customer service and operational excellence. In 2012, Pentair merged with Tyco International Ltd.’s Flow Control division, which included our Thermal Management business and the nVent RAYCHEM brand, a global leader in heat tracing solutions. In 2015, Pentair acquired ERICO Global Company, a leading global manufacturer of superior engineered electrical and fastening products, which operates as our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business, broadening our product offering and enabling us to provide additional global solutions to our combined customers. 
We are “One nVent”, with a unified focus on commercial excellence, digital transformation, scaled and integrated technology, and global presence and capabilities. As we continue scaling our capabilities under our umbrella brand of nVent, we expect to expand our products and solutions and to continue to differentiate our company by creating solutions that solve problems for our customers. 
Our Spark management system defines how we operate. The five elements of Spark are People, Growth, Lean, Digital and Velocity. Together, they provide the mindset and operating system to propel the success of our company. Spark supports the high performance culture we are building at nVent. 
•People are at the core of Spark, positively impacting our business and growing their careers.
•Growth is the foundation of Spark, driving shareholder, customer and employee value.
•Lean is the relentless pursuit of eliminating waste and increasing velocity.
•Digital transforms our products and how we do business, improving both customer and employee experiences.
•Velocity is increasing speed in all we do for each other and our customers.
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS
We operate across three segments: Enclosures, Electrical & Fastening Solutions and Thermal Management. The following is a brief description of each of the Company's reportable segments and business activities. 
Enclosures 
Our Enclosures business provides innovative solutions to connect and protect critical electronics, communication, control and power equipment. We are a leader in the enclosures sector, and our key brands, nVent HOFFMAN and SCHROFF, have a long history of solving customers’ problems by providing high quality solutions.

Electrical & Fastening Solutions 
Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business provides fastening solutions that connect and protect electrical and mechanical systems and civil structures. 
We are a global leader in fastening solutions with spring steel and specialty metal fixings and reinforced steel connections, and our products are primarily marketed under the nVent CADDY brand. Our products reduce total installed cost by ease of installation, provide design flexibility and increase structural integrity in electrical and mechanical fastening applications through inventive products and solutions and customer intimacy. These products are targeted towards commercial and industrial verticals with applications in fire & seismic, data & telecommunications, electrical fastening and heating, ventilation and air conditioning. These products are primarily used by electricians, telecommunications installers and roof top contractors. 
We are also a global leader in bonding, grounding, lightning protection and low voltage power distribution products and solutions. These products are primarily marketed under the nVent ERICO brand. We offer a comprehensive range of facility electrical connection and protection solutions to protect against electrical transients to improve safety and reliability of electrical systems. Our products reduce total cost of ownership and provide design flexibility by offering maintenance free and reliable products and global end-user application expertise and intimacy. These products are targeted towards commercial, infrastructure and industrial verticals with applications in telecommunication, power distribution and facility electrical protection. These products and solutions are primarily used by electricians, panel builders, energy contractors and lightning protection installers. 
Thermal Management 
Our Thermal Management business provides electric thermal solutions that connect and protect critical buildings, infrastructure, industrial processes and people. Its highly reliable and easy-to-install solutions lower total cost of ownership to building owners, facility managers, operators and end users. Thermal Management’s products have been installed in some of the world’s most iconic buildings.
For industrial and energy, we provide industrial heat-tracing and wiring, control and monitoring, sensing, engineering and construction services under industry leading nVent RAYCHEM and TRACER brands, primarily serving chemical and other industries. Products and solutions include heat tracing for freeze protection and process temperature maintenance, temperature control and monitoring systems, heat-traced tubing bundles, instrument winterization and tank heating systems. For commercial, residential and infrastructure, we provide products and services primarily under our nVent RAYCHEM brand. Applications include pipe freeze protection, roof and gutter deicing, surface snow melting, hot water temperature maintenance, floor heating, fire rated wiring and leak detection for healthcare, recreation, hospitality, commercial offices and education facilities. 
Competition 
The markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive. We compete against large and well-established national and global companies, as well as regional and local companies and lower-cost manufacturers. Some of our competitors, in particular smaller companies, attempt to compete based primarily on price, localized expertise and local relationships, especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise. In addition, during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price. Competition focuses on product performance, price, quality and service.
Our success depends on a variety of factors, including technical expertise, reputation for quality and reliability, timeliness of delivery, new product innovation, previous installation history, contractual terms and price. As many of our products sell through electrical distributors, data center contractors, original equipment manufacturers and maintenance contractors, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel and distribution network. 
Seasonality 
We generally experience increased demand for Electrical & Fastening Solutions products during the spring and summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and increased demand for Thermal Management products and services during the fall and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.
Backlog of Orders by Segment
 | December 31 | | 
In millions | 2021 | 2020 | $ change | % change
Enclosures | $ | 296.2 | | $ | 117.0 | $ | 179.2 | 153.2 | %
Electrical & Fastening Solutions | 70.8 | | 34.1 | | 36.7 | 107.6 | 
Thermal Management | 191.5 | | 155.9 | | 35.6 | 22.8 | 
Total | $ | 558.5 | | $ | 307.0 | $ | 251.5 | 81.9 | %

A substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month. Our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order. However, a portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order. We record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. 
The increase in backlog from 2020 to 2021 was primarily the result of a significant increase in demand for our products and higher selling prices, along with increased order lead times, as compared to the prior year. We expect the majority of our backlog at December 31, 2021 will be shipped in 2022.
Raw materials
The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.
We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.
As COVID-19 conditions have improved and economic activity has increased, we have experienced supply chain challenges, including increased lead times, as well as inflation of raw materials, logistics and labor costs due to availability constraints and high demand. However, we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials.
Intellectual property
Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Captive insurance subsidiary
We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers' compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Tonka Bay Insurance Company ("Tonka Bay"). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals are established with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Tonka Bay liabilities and those of certain non-U.S. operations.
Matters pertaining to Tonka Bay are discussed in ITEM 3, included in this Form 10-K.
HUMAN CAPITAL MATTERS
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,900 people worldwide, of which approximately 33% are located in the U.S. A small portion of our U.S. employees are unionized, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.
Inclusion and Diversity
We aspire to be an equitable, inclusive and diverse company. We believe that the unique contributions of individuals with varying backgrounds and experiences will benefit our businesses. Guided by our Win Right values, we are committed to creating a workplace culture where everyone is included and respected. Our Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to equal opportunity and fair treatment for all. We do not tolerate acts of harassment, including any conduct or statements made on the basis of protected status that are intimidating, hostile or abusive.
Our leaders actively support and encourage employee development and engagement, including through our CEO Inclusion Council and an active Inclusion & Diversity Advisory Council. These councils promote inclusion across all dimensions of diversity.
We also support our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which were created organically by our employees and which provide a support system to foster awareness, promote inclusion and respect and provide a sounding board on strategic initiatives for nVent. Open to all employees, the ERGs are designed to create connections and opportunities for development, training and community involvement. In 2021, we had approximately 800 members globally in our ERGs. 
In 2021, we expanded our training programs by offering Diversity 101 training in employees' native languages in which all of our people managers attended. We also introduced a new People and Culture Scorecard performance metric to our annual incentive compensation plan for management employees. The Scorecard focuses on five quantitative metrics to help drive year-over-year improvement in the following categories:
•Inclusion Index score from our quarterly employee pulse survey
•Employee Resource Group membership
•Diverse candidate slates
•Global gender representation for our professional and management populations
•U.S. racial representation for our professional and management populations
Additional details on our People and Culture Scorecard will be provided in our annual Proxy Statement for our 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders.
All executive officers developed diversity action plans for their business segments and functions, highlighting focused efforts on improving human capital metrics, engagement and a deeper awareness of inclusion & diversity.
Global Gender Diversity In The Workplace, as based on EEO-1 Report categories (as of December 31, 2021):
•44% of our executive leadership team are female; 56% are male
•26% of our global management team are female; 74% are male
•25% of all other employees are female; 75% are male
We also launched, established baseline metrics, and trained over 400 internal stakeholders on a formal Supply Diversity program in 2021.
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to offer our employees across the world comprehensive benefit programs that reflect the market practices in their country of employment. We participate in and review remuneration surveys from leading, independent consultants for all of our countries so that we have the information to set competitive wages and salaries. 
We are dedicated to providing equitable compensation as a commitment to our people. By focusing on equitable pay, we enhance our ability to grow, retain and motivate diverse employees on our team. We believe diverse teams drive innovation, connection and growth for our employees.
As part of this commitment to our people, we conduct pay parity reviews of our compensation systems. The goal of these reviews is to ensure internal pay alignment and equitable treatment for employees, as well as providing competitive and performance-based pay.
Employee Engagement and Development
We believe it is important to hear from our employees to learn about what we are doing well, and where we can become stronger. During 2021, we conducted four pulse surveys with questions focused on our Inclusion Index and employee satisfaction. As discussed under “Inclusion and Diversity,” the Inclusion Index is one of the metrics used in the People and Culture Scorecard for our annual incentive compensation plan for management. Results from each of the pulse surveys were shared with people managers, who were encouraged to discuss results and potential improvement areas with their teams. In 2021, as part of our annual goal planning process, all of our people managers were assigned a people manager goal focused on engaging and developing their employees. Action items in the people manager goal included: completing all performance processes including goal setting, mid-year, and annual reviews on time; creating an action plan from the 2020 employee engagement survey results; supporting an increase in the diversity of our candidate slates; and helping to ensure that people managers and their direct reports completed all ethics and compliance training on time.
We are also focused on recognizing our employees. Employee recognition was identified as an area of focus following our 2020 employee engagement survey. In 2021, we launched a global, digitized recognition platform, which allows employees to publicly appreciate one another as well as managers to give monetary and non-monetary forms of recognition to their employees around the globe.
As part of our continued efforts to develop our people, we launched a leadership series that had over 500 participants, launched a formalized mentoring program, and refreshed our Culture program and delivered it to employees around the globe. Our professional employees were asked to create individual development plans identifying key competencies to continue to grow or develop. With the goal of aligning development with retention, we also encourage our employees to regularly engage with their managers to discuss their performance, development and career aspirations.
Code of Conduct Training 
Our Code of Conduct training was offered in 12 different languages to employees in 34 countries. Topics included nVent’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, Preventing Bribery, Use of Social Media, Dignity and Respect in the Workplace and Data Privacy and Cybersecurity. In 2021, we completed the training with 100% completion rate among professional employees. Additionally we launched role-based training in the areas of Bribery, Kickbacks and Conflicts of Interest. In 2021, we continued rolling out our live Code of Conduct training program for our offline, factory team members to multiple sites in North America, China and Europe. 
We provide multiple ways for employees to ask for help and report misconduct and illegal or unethical behavior, including doing so anonymously. A Helpline is available on our website (www.nventethics.com) and is available 24/7 and accessible in over 200 languages. We are committed to investigating and responding to reported concerns. nVent prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises concerns or makes good-faith reports regarding possible breaches of law or policy or ethical violations.
Workplace Health and Safety
The safety and well-being of our employees is our top priority. We are committed to preventing workplace injuries and maintaining a positive, healthy work environment. We encourage our employees to put safety first, speak up when they observe unsafe conditions or behaviors and follow all safety practices. We expect our employees to maintain a workplace free from illegal or controlled substances, weapons or potentially dangerous devices, and we strive for all nVent locations to meet or exceed all applicable Environmental, Health, and Safety ("EHS") requirements. We utilize a common safety standard identified within our EHS Lean Assessment highlighting expectations surrounding management commitment, employee engagement, metrics, regulatory compliance and hazard control. 
We monitor and track health and safety data, including employee injuries, environmental releases and regulatory inspections. Additionally, we assess the EHS maturity of our locations by measuring progress against nVent's EHS Lean Assessment and Standards and region specific regulatory compliance evaluations, as well as nVent's employee driven risk notification program. Results are reviewed monthly to reduce recordable injury rates and to drive improvement within our EHS programs. Globally, we have adopted guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) in the United States to determine recordable injuries. 
We have achieved a strong safety track record through employee engagement, behavior based safety and proactive risk management.
