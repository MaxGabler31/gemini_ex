Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical development-stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging nitric oxide’s naturally occurring anti-microbial and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat a range of diseases with significant unmet needs. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates. Novan has created a proprietary Nitricil technology platform enabling the development of new chemical entities, or NCEs, with sustained delivery of nitric oxide. To date, we have focused primarily on nitric oxide’s role in dermatological diseases, but have recently announced an expansion of the platform into the areas of women’s health and gastroenterology. This decision is based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of diseases in these areas and the demonstrable anti-microbial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan’s nitric oxide technology. Our goal is to create the world’s leading macro-molecular nitric oxide-based science, technology, and clinical translation company that delivers safe and efficacious therapies for patients. 
Current Financial Status
As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.2 million and positive working capital of $0.3 million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, including an upfront installment payment which was received from our Japanese market commercial partner in March 2019, will provide us with adequate liquidity to fund our planned operating needs into May 2019, as described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will need substantial additional funding to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in our drug development programs, as described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Overview” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Therefore, we will need to secure additional capital or financing and/or delay, defer, or reduce our cash expenditures by May 2019, including those associated with our product development programs, or to dissolve and liquidate our assets or seek protection under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or financing on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all. If we are forced to terminate or eliminate our product development programs, wind down our operations, liquidate or seek bankruptcy protection, it is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay our obligations, and, accordingly, it is further unclear whether and to what extent any resources would be available for distributions to our stockholders.
The Novan Nitric Oxide Platform
Nitric oxide is one of the most researched molecules in human physiology and has been extensively studied in many areas of medicine including in microbial diseases and in the modulation of inflammation. The scarcity of nitric oxide-based therapeutic products is due to the challenges associated with controlling the release of a gas, the poor stability and low storage capacity of nitric oxide-loaded molecules, the inability to target specific tissues and the toxicity of several small molecules used as carriers to store nitric oxide.
The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific indications:

(1) | Novan’s Nitricil technology enables us to store large amounts of nitric oxide gas in a stable, solid form by chemically loading it on a macromolecule, or polymer. The advantages of our proprietary Nitricil technology include tunability, stability, high storage capacity, targeted delivery and what we believe is an attractive safety profile. Our ability to select from several nitric oxide-loaded materials has created our proprietary library of Nitricil compositions, each of which possesses a unique nitric oxide release profile.


(2) | Our formulation science and expertise allow us to customize the drug delivery method for the relevant anatomical location of a variety of diseases. With our dermatological indications, the topical semi-solid formulations enable us to further tune the release of nitric oxide when applied by using proprietary combinations of inactive ingredients. This additional level of control enables us to use one NCE for multiple indications by altering the nitric oxide pharmacology with the composition of the topical formulation. This component of our nitric oxide platform creates an additional barrier to entry, which we believe positions us to prolong the period of market exclusivity for each of our product candidates.

We believe that our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of dermatology, women’s health and GI diseases.

At present, our nitric oxide platform has produced a portfolio that includes the following clinical stage dermatology product candidates.

• | SB204 is a once-daily, topical monotherapy being developed for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a multi-factorial disease with multiple aspects of the disease pathology (anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial) potentially treatable with SB204.


• | SB206 is a topical anti-viral gel being developed for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on the treatment of molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus, and external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus, or HPV.


• | SB208 is a topical broad-spectrum anti-fungal gel being developed for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin and nails, including athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) and fungal nail infections (onychomycosis).


• | SB414 is a topical cream-based product candidate being developed for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, with a current focus on the treatment of atopic dermatitis (a type of eczema) and psoriasis.

We presently maintain exclusive, worldwide commercial rights for all product candidates currently in our pipeline, with the exception of the rights we licensed to Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Sato, in January 2017 and October 2018 to develop, use and sell SB204 and SB206 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris and viral skin infections, respectively, and to manufacture the finished form of such products following regulatory approval in Japan.
Nitric Oxide Background
Nitric oxide, or NO, is a two-atom molecule that is produced naturally by the human body. Since the Nobel Prize-winning discovery in 1998 that nitric oxide is responsible for regulating blood flow, or vasodilation, the effects of nitric oxide have been extensively studied in many areas of physiology.
As a fundamental component in host defense against invading organisms, cells of the immune system naturally generate nitric oxide using the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, or NOS, and the amino acid precursor L-arginine. Nitric oxide is released in a targeted manner to kill microbial pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Nitric oxide and its metabolites drive cell death within bacteria and fungi by targeting metal centers or amino acids on proteins critical to sustaining microbial viability. In virally infected cells, nitric oxide inhibits viral replication by binding directly to free sulfurs or metals that are a part of key enzymes that can induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cells where tumor suppressors have been degraded or disabled.
We believe that nitric oxide has potential to be a novel anti-microbial agent due to its multiple mechanisms of action and its ability as a gas to diffuse freely through cell membranes – unlike most other pharmaceutical agents. Importantly, the pharmacologic activity of nitric oxide is such that its production is localized at or near the site of infection. Because nitric oxide is a key component of the immune system’s natural response to invading organisms, it may provide a therapeutic solution for degrading and killing microorganisms without the development of anti-microbial resistance.
Nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action have wide ranging possibilities to treat human disease. We believe that our expertise at developing nitric oxide NCEs and fine tuning the formulation technology to the targeted disease separates us from other drug development companies focused in this space. Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring chemical in the human body, which enhances its safety profile. The proven anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects of nitric oxide, combined with its naturally strong safety profile and our ability to capture and deliver effective doses, positions Novan with the potential to bring multiple products to patients. 
Limitations of Other Nitric Oxide-Based Approaches
Despite its therapeutic potential, there is currently only one use of nitric oxide approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which is the use of nitric oxide gas for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonatal infants. However, the delivery of nitric oxide from a gas tank is inconvenient and limits practical applications. The scarcity of nitric oxide-based products is due to the historical challenges associated with developing safe and effective approaches for the chemical storage and controlled release of a gas for therapeutic applications.

Advantages of Our Nitric Oxide Platform
We believe the Novan platform harnesses the potential of nitric oxide in a manner that leads to the creation of differentiated product candidates that address these limitations by (1) engineering tunable NCEs that store nitric oxide gas in solid form using our Nitricil technology and (2) using our formulation science to customize the drug delivery method for the anatomical location of a disease.
Our Product Candidates
We are advancing strategic development programs in the field of dermatology, with the intention of further expanding the platform into women’s health and GI therapeutic areas. We have clinical-stage dermatology drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208) and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We are utilizing our existing capital resources to fund the ongoing and near-term Phase 3 preparatory activities for our SB206 molluscum program, as described in further detail below. Advancement of our development programs beyond immediate activities is dependent upon our ability to access additional capital from non-dilutive sources, including partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships, or through equity or debt financings, which could result in dilution. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of our current liquidity and our future funding needs.
Our dermatological clinical-stage product candidate pipeline is currently positioned as described in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1:
SB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris
We are developing, SB204, as a once-daily, topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the U.S., affecting approximately 40 million to 50 million Americans annually. The disease ranges in severity from mild to severe cystic acne and causes both physical and psychological effects, including permanent scarring, anxiety, depression and poor self-esteem. Acne is a multi-factorial disease with several mechanistic contributors to the disease pathology, often requiring treatments that address more than one of the major causes of acne pathogenesis. Localized nitric oxide delivery may provide anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity from a single active ingredient.
We believe that acne continues to be characterized as an unmet medical need due to the difficulty of balancing efficacy, systemic safety and cutaneous tolerability, as well as the growing concerns with anti-bacterial resistance with existing therapies. In our more than 3,200-patient SB204 clinical development program, topical application of SB204 has been well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns identified. In maximal-use pharmacokinetic trials that we have conducted in adult and pediatric patients with acne vulgaris, we observed no detectable systemic exposure from SB204 following its topical application.
6

In the first quarter of 2017, we reported top-line results from two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials for SB204. SB204 demonstrated statistical significance compared to vehicle on all three co-primary endpoints in one of the trials but demonstrated statistical significance on only one of three co-primary endpoints in the other trial. We conducted an in-depth examination of the full data sets from these trials, including post hoc analyses in pooled and sub populations, with extensive assistance from third-party expert consultants in biostatistics and regulatory affairs.
In mid-2017 we completed our 40-week long term safety trial in eligible patients with acne who had previously completed 12 weeks of treatment in the related Phase 3 pivotal trials of SB204. No serious adverse events were observed with over 400 patients followed for six months and over 200 patients followed for one year.
We have had several interactions with the FDA since mid-2017 regarding SB204 and the acne indication. In September 2017, we conducted a guidance meeting with the FDA to obtain clinical and regulatory guidance by reviewing the previously completed parallel Phase 3 pivotal trials in patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The FDA’s specific feedback noted that there were no additional safety requirements and that one additional pivotal trial, in moderate-to-severe acne, would be required for submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA.
In the second quarter of 2018, we conducted a Type C meeting to further discuss the Phase 3 program with the FDA and the potential for proceeding with a more narrowly defined patient segmentation. In that dialogue, our focus was centered specifically on the severe patient population. The FDA provided feedback in their minutes, received in the third quarter of 2018, on two paths forward for the acne indication, confirming the need for one additional pivotal trial for moderate-to-severe acne or, as an alternative, additional preliminary trials for a severe-only patient population. 
Following receipt of FDA feedback via written minutes, we have determined that the most pragmatic development pathway for us will be to conduct one additional pivotal Phase 3 trial in moderate-to-severe acne patients. We have completed our clinical development plan for this additional trial and have conducted certain initial clinical start-up procedures for a targeted trial initiation during the second half of 2019, subject to our ability to obtain additional financing or strategic partnering.
In January 2017, we entered into a license agreement, and a related amendment, with Sato, or the Sato Agreement, whereby we licensed rights to develop, use, and sell SB204 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The significant terms and the related accounting considerations of the Sato Agreement are further described in the “Collaboration and Licensing Agreements” section below and in “Note 4—Licensing Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Viral Skin Infections
We are developing SB206 as a topical anti-viral gel for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum, a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus, and external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus.
Molluscum Contagiosum
At the end-of-Phase 2 meeting for SB206 in the external genital warts indication, we also had a constructive discussion with the FDA regarding expansion of the SB206 program into the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus. Molluscum affects approximately six million people in the U.S. annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months, however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients that receive treatment are treated with painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.
We believe that observational learnings from an in-licensed topical nitric oxide technology study showing clinically meaningful complete clearance rates of baseline molluscum lesions, combined with our SB206 program knowledge, provided a logical pathway for SB206 development in the molluscum indication. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA in December 2017 and initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial utilizing SB206 for the treatment of molluscum in the first quarter of 2018. The Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, ascending dose clinical trial evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SB206 in 256 patients, ages 2 and above, with molluscum. Patients were treated with one of three concentrations of SB206 or vehicle for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12, with signs of efficacy evident as early as Week 2 with the 12% once-daily dose. The safety and tolerability profiles were favorable overall with no serious adverse events reported, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily.
7

With the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, we held an end-of-Phase 2 (Type B) meeting with the FDA in early March 2019. Based on this meeting and the written minutes received, we target commencing the Phase 3 development program for molluscum including two pivotal clinical trials in the second quarter of 2019 with SB206 12% once-daily as the active treatment arm, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering. We are completing our clinical development plan for these trials, have engaged a contract research organization, or CRO, for the execution of the pivotal trials and have conducted certain clinical start-up procedures. If we initiate this program in the second quarter of 2019, we target top line results in the first half of 2020. We will need substantial additional funding by May 2019 to continue our operating activities and make further advancements in this program. Refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of our current liquidity and our current and future funding needs.
External Genital Warts
Genital warts are among the world’s most common sexually transmitted diseases. Genital warts are usually flesh-colored growths that can be raised, flat or cauliflower-shaped and are typically found on the surface of the external genitalia or in and around the anus. In males, they can appear on the surface of the penis and scrotum, and in females inside the vagina or on the cervix. Genital warts carry a substantial psychosocial burden due to the shame and embarrassment related to having a sexually transmitted disease as well as the inconvenience and discomfort of current treatment modalities. Current treatment options for genital warts consist of ablative procedures that cut, burn or freeze the warts but do not address the underlying viral infection, and there are no currently approved oral or topical prescription products indicated for the treatment of genital warts with a direct anti-viral mechanism of action. Approximately 70% of patients treated for external genital warts receive locally destructive procedures, such as cryotherapy or curettage. Approximately 46% of patients are treated with prescription drugs alone or in combination with procedures. Both topical therapies and ablative procedures for genital warts remain largely ineffective in achieving long-term wart eradication and the average recurrence rates range from 30% to 70%. The approved drugs for the treatment of warts are pro-inflammatory in their mechanism of action and lead to ulcers, erosions and burning/stinging.
We evaluated SB206’s anti-viral activity in a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled clinical trial in 107 patients with genital warts caused by HPV. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of external genital and perianal warts. Once-daily treatment arms were generally well-tolerated, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily.
With the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, a Type B meeting was held with the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 with minutes received shortly thereafter. SB206 is currently positioned for Phase 3 pivotal trials in patients with external genital warts, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
In October 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the Sato Agreement, whereby we licensed rights to develop, use, and sell SB206 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of viral skin infections. The significant terms and the related accounting considerations of the Sato Agreement, as amended, are further described in the “Collaboration and Licensing Agreements” section below and in “Note 4-Licensing Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SB208, a Topical Anti-fungal for the Treatment of Athlete’s Foot (Tinea Pedis) and Fungal Nail Infections (Onychomycosis)
We are developing SB208 as a broad-spectrum anti-fungal gel for the treatment of superficial cutaneous fungal infections of the skin and nails, such as tinea pedis and onychomycosis. Recent studies suggest that both the nail plate, interdigital space and surrounding cutaneous tissue may serve as an overlooked reservoir of dermatophytes, perpetuating reinfection and coinfection of onychomycosis and tinea pedis. Additionally, studies have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when tinea pedis and onychomycosis are treated concurrently, suggesting that an effective topical treatment, suitable for simultaneous application to the nail plate and skin, may lead to lower rates of recurrence and enhanced efficacy.
Onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the nails that affects approximately 40 million Americans and accounts for one-third of cutaneous fungal infections. The prevalence of disease increases with age, and more than 50% of patients are 70 years or older. The infection, caused by dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum, often results in painful thickening and deformation of the nail and sometimes the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, leading to an inability of the nail to perform its natural protective function. Oral therapies used to treat the infection are associated with severe side effects, and topical therapies have modest efficacy profiles with complete cure rates of less than 20%.
8

Tinea pedis, often referred to as Athlete’s Foot, is a common fungal infection of the feet, affecting approximately 75 million Americans. Trichophyton rubrum is the most prominent dermatophyte in tinea pedis and also a causative pathogen in onychomycosis. Approximately one-third of onychomycosis patients also suffer from tinea pedis. Topical treatments are the first-line therapy for tinea pedis, while oral anti-fungals are prescribed when the infection is severe or the use of topical anti-fungals is not feasible. Currently, there is no approved single topical therapeutic agent that provides for the simultaneous treatment of the nail plate, bed, and surrounding cutaneous tissue.
In the ChubTur® infected human nail assay, a model utilized previously in the drug development of Kerydin® (tavaborole) Topical Solution, 5%, and Jublia® (efinaconazole) Topical Solution, 10%, nitric oxide-releasing formulations including SB208 demonstrated rapid penetration of the nail and effective fungal killing of Trichophyton rubrum in 24 hours following a single treatment application.
We conducted a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of tinea pedis and announced top-line results in the second quarter of 2017. SB208 demonstrated a statistically significant effect compared to vehicle in (i) the primary endpoint of achieving negative fungal culture at day 14 and (ii) the secondary endpoint of achieving mycological cure at the day 14 (mycological cure is defined by having a negative laboratory culture and negative fungal clinical diagnosis). At the end of a 4-week post treatment follow-up period, mycological cure was maintained at day 42 in both dose groups.
We conducted a Phase 1, single-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial in 32 adult females to evaluate the rate of fingernail growth associated with SB208 16% and the local tolerability of the gel when used over the course of 29 days. SB208 16% demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean daily nail growth rate for the treatment period when compared to the same patient’s own growth rate in the run-in period and was well tolerated by patients.
SB414, a Topical Cream for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases
We are developing SB414 as a topical cream product candidate for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Inflammatory skin disorders are the results of immune system reactions that involve the skin. Biologic therapies are often used to treat patients with severe disease. A non-steroidal topical therapy that targets key inflammatory cytokines could address an unmet need for approximately 14 million atopic dermatitis patients and approximately 6 million psoriasis patients with less severe disease burden.
We submitted an IND with SB414 cream for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases to the FDA during the third quarter of 2017. In 2018, we completed two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The design of these complementary trials was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB414. The trials were also designed to assess overall and specific target engagement through a reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers, also known as pharmacodynamic assessment.
We initiated a Phase 1b trial with SB414 in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in December 2017. In the Phase 1b trial, 48 adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis with up to 30% body surface area at baseline, were randomized to receive one of 2% SB414 cream, 6% SB414 cream, or vehicle, twice daily for two weeks. In the complimentary Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks.
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is the most common chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease, affecting nearly 18 million people in the United States with no FDA-approved cure. Stabilizing the disease and reducing the number and severity of flares are the primary goals of current treatment options. The disease is characterized by recurrent red plaques, intense itching, dry skin with red papules and plaques, “weeping” clear fluid, crust and scaling. Immune cells in the deep layers of skin release inflammatory signals, causing an itchy rash. Scratching leads to defects in the skin barrier function, allowing environmental triggers, such as the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, to penetrate the skin barrier and further exacerbate the immune cells. A recent study showed that the entry of S. aureus into the dermis triggers immune abnormalities seen in atopic dermatitis skin. Nearly 80% of the atopic dermatitis population suffers from mild-to-moderate disease and is treated with first-line monotherapies, such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, however, corticosteroids and calcineruin inhibitors have side effects and are not well-suited for chronic use. Recently, the first biologic treatment for atopic dermatitis targeting interleukin-4, or IL-4, and IL-13 was approved, but it is reserved for patients with moderate to severe disease. Additionally, a topical PDE4 inhibitor was recently approved after more than a decade absent of any new mechanisms of action.
9

In two in vivo models that assess critical components of atopic dermatitis disease pathology, SB414 displayed potent anti-staphylococcal activity and dose-dependent inhibition of inflammation comparable to betamethasone, a mid-potency corticosteroid used to treat patients with atopic dermatitis. Based on preclinical data generated to date and documented literature on nitric oxide’s mechanisms of action, we believe that SB414 cream has the potential to offer non-steroidal, immunomodulatory activity and anti-staphylococcal activity for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, SB414 cream is an occlusive formulation allowing for pH control in the skin and a possible reduction in trans-epidermal water loss, both important factors for treating the disease.
We received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from the Phase 1b clinical trials during the second and third quarters of 2018. In the atopic dermatitis trial, Biomarkers from the Th2, Th17 and Th22 inflammatory pathways known to be highly relevant and indicative of atopic dermatitis, including Interleukin-13, or IL-13, IL-4R, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-22, were downregulated after two weeks of treatment with SB414 2%. The changes in Th2 and Th22 biomarkers and clinical efficacy assessed as the percent change in Eczema Area Severity Index scores were highly correlated in the SB414 2% group. Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 3-point improvement on the pruritus (itch) numeric rating scale after two weeks of treatment was greater for patients treated with SB414 2% compared to patients treated with vehicle. 
The 2% or 6% doses of SB414 in the trial did not result in any serious adverse events, and SB414 2% was more tolerable with no patients discontinuing treatment in the trial due to application site reactions. SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours, in both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. Given the successful downregulation of key biomarkers, favorable tolerability and lack of systemic exposure with SB414 2%, we intend to conduct a Phase 2 trial of SB414 as a treatment for atopic dermatitis and additional exploratory trials in other inflammatory skin diseases, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 7.5 million people in the United States. The disease is characterized by an errant immune-system response that drives inflammation and thickening of the skin caused by rapid turnover of skin cells. This typically results in patches of plaques, or thick, red raised skin with silvery-white scales. There is no cure for psoriasis. The healthcare market has seen an increase in the introduction of systemic therapies, including biologics, to treat patients with higher disease burden, but the current systemic therapies are indicated only for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. For the approximately 80% of patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis, prescription treatment options include topical corticosteroids, retinoids and vitamin D3. 
We initiated clinical development of SB414, the Company’s first use of our nitric oxide platform in the field of immunology by dosing the first patient in October 2017 in a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate SB414 in a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. Earlier in 2017, we presented mechanistic evidence for SB414, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in composite psoriasis scores and an inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F in an animal model.
The purpose of the Phase 1b trial was to evaluate safety and to assess target engagement through a reduction of key pro-inflammatory biomarkers like interleukin-17, or IL-17, before progressing to Phase 2 clinical trials. According to a recent peer-reviewed article in the British Journal of Dermatology, IL-17 is known to be or is likely to be related to the mechanism and severity of a number of inflammatory skin disorders, including psoriasis, acne, atopic dermatitis, rosacea and alopecia areata. 
In the Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. We received and analyzed the preliminary top line results from this Phase 1b clinical trial during the second and third quarters of 2018. SB414 at the 6% dose did not result in any serious adverse events, but SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across the trial. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. Additionally, SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours. Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in psoriasis, we will potentially explore the use of lower doses of SB414 in psoriasis, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.

Women’s Health Business Unit
On October 25, 2018, we announced the formation of a dedicated women’s health business unit as well as a foundational collaboration with Health Decisions Inc., or Health Decisions. Health Decisions is a full-service contract research organization specializing in clinical studies of therapeutics for women’s health indications. Over the past twelve months, we have progressed our knowledge on the potential to utilize nitric oxide-based products in the field of women’s health, with an emphasis on oncovirus applications and our initial focus centering on persistent high-risk HPV. Central to our effort has been an ongoing, multi-year research collaboration with the University of Alabama-Birmingham studying the effects of nitric oxide-releasing compounds on HPV infections. Published clinical research on high-risk HPV infections has demonstrated a link to the development of malignant lesions and neoplasia, including female cancers in the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus and oral cavity. This foundational science advancement pairs with our previously announced Phase 2 data for the treatment of external genital warts, where SB206 12% demonstrated statistically significant clearance of baseline warts and was generally well-tolerated, provide a specific late stage clinical asset that targets HPV. We believe that our new clinical collaboration with Health Decisions and our ongoing academic research collaboration with the University of Alabama-Birmingham provides us with a differentiated opportunity for advancement in the area of women’s health. 
Our acquisition of exclusive worldwide rights for certain oncovirus applications of nitric oxide-based products from KNOW Bio, LLC, or KNOW Bio, in October 2017 enables the potential expansion into this therapeutic area. The terms of this intellectual property acquisition transaction are further described in “Note 2—KNOW Bio, LLC” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GI Therapeutic Focus
In January 2019, we announced the addition of GI diseases as a therapeutic focus area as part of our overall science and business strategy. This decision is based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of GI diseases and the demonstrable anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan’s nitric oxide technology. Nitric oxide produced in the GI tract regulates many of its functions including the secretion of mucous for protection against physical, chemical, and microbial injury, perfusion of blood through the GI tissue, mitigation of white blood cell adherence to GI tissue to protect from injury and the healing and repair of ulcers. We intend to initially focus on pediatric GI diseases given the favorable safety profile of nitric oxide and our existing pre-clinical and clinical data. We believe that expansion into GI will require minimal initial investment due to our ability to leverage current technology experience and assets.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We consider our primary potential competition to be a broad base of existing providers and drug developers of therapeutics to treat molluscum, acne vulgaris, genital warts, onychomycosis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Additional providers and drug developers will become primary potential competition as we expand our platform to include the women’s health, GI and other potential therapeutic areas. Product competition includes pharmaceutical generics, branded generics, pharmaceutical brands, biologics as well as over-the-counter, or OTC, products. We expect continued future competition across research and drug development in various different fields of innovation; capital and resource allocation to many of these areas appears to be continuous and of a global nature. In addition, there are certain instances where competition extends into the medical procedure and the medical device spectrums of human health care. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with these existing therapies as well as new therapies that may become available in the future. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products and therapies.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluating and taking appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts. We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
We own or have an exclusive license to issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions (including applications filed in foreign jurisdictions and international or Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that have not yet entered national phase). Patent coverage lasts for varying periods according to the date of filing 
11

of the patent application or the date of grant or issuance of the patent and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the extension term cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Nitricil Technology
We exclusively license from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or UNC, issued patents and pending applications directed to our library of Nitricil compounds, including patents issued in the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia with claims intended to cover NVN1000, the NCE for our current clinical-stage product candidates. Additionally, one such issued patent in the United States has claims specifically directed to the composition of matter of NVN1000. These patents and pending applications, if issued, are projected to expire in 2026 without taking into account any patent term extensions that may be available to us. Additionally, NVN1000 has been classified as an NCE, and patent term extensions may be available to extend the life of a U.S. patent that covers NVN1000 beyond 2026. We also own patents issued in the United States, China, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland directed to methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds. These patents are projected to expire in 2032.
Formulation Science and Therapeutic Uses
We own patents issued in the United States, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, China, Mexico, South Korea and Japan and pending applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, including Brazil and Canada directed to methods of reducing sebum production using nitric oxide-releasing macromolecules, including, in certain embodiments, through the use of Nitricil compounds. We also own issued patents in the United States, Australia and Japan and pending applications filed in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe and Japan directed to the alcohol gel component of SB204 and SB206 and/or the SB204 and SB206 two-component formulations. We are pursuing United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and South Korea applications directed to the use of nitric oxide-releasing compounds, including, in certain embodiments, Nitricil compounds, for the treatment of viral skin infections.
Altogether, our issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, if issued, relating to one or more of our clinical-stage product candidates are projected to expire between 2026 and 2037, without taking into account any patent term extensions that may be available to us and assuming that prosecution is pursued to issuance with no shortening of term.
Other Patented Technology
In addition to the patents and pending applications we own or have an exclusive license related to Nitricil and our product candidates, we also own or have exclusive licenses to issued patents and pending applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions covering other nitric oxide-based therapeutics and/or methods of use in indications for dermatological and oncovirus-mediated diseases.
Trade Secrets
We rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, or to include such provisions in their consulting agreement, upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements and provisions, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
Sato License Agreement, as Amended
On January 12, 2017, we entered into a license agreement, and related amendment, with Sato relating to SB204, for the treatment of acne vulgaris in Japan, or the Sato Agreement. On October 5, 2018, we entered into the second amendment to the Sato Agreement, or the Sato Amendment (collectively the Amended Sato Agreement). The Sato Amendment expands the Sato Agreement to include SB206, our drug candidate for the treatment of viral skin infections, including molluscum. Pursuant to the Amended Sato Agreement, we granted to Sato an exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable license under certain of our intellectual property rights, with the right to sublicense with our prior written consent, to develop, use and sell products in Japan that incorporate SB206 or SB204 in certain topical dosage forms for the treatment of viral skin infections or acne vulgaris, respectively, and to make the finished form of such products. We, or our designated contract manufacturer will also supply finished product to Sato for use in development of SB204 or SB206 in the licensed territory. The rights granted to Sato do not include the right to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of SB206 or SB204; rather, the parties agreed to negotiate a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which we or a third party contract manufacturer would be the exclusive supplier to Sato of the API for the commercial manufacture of licensed products in the licensed territory. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Sato Agreement, Sato had an exclusive option to negotiate for the license rights in certain additional territories within Asia, subject to Sato’s payment of a specified option exercise fee. During the third quarter of 2017, Sato elected not to execute this option and, as a result, the option expired unexercised. 
Under the terms of the Amended Sato Agreement, we also have exclusive rights to certain intellectual property that may be developed by Sato in the future, which we may choose to use for our own development and commercialization of SB204 or SB206 outside of Japan. The term of the Amended Sato Agreement (and the period during which Sato must pay royalties under the Amended Sato Agreement) expires on the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the licensed field in the licensed territory. 
For additional information about the Amended Sato Agreement, please see the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Updates” and “Note 4—Licensing Arrangements” of the accompanying financial statements.
UNC License Agreement
We acquired exclusive rights to our library of Nitricil compounds pursuant to license agreements with UNC entered into in July 2007 and October 2009, which were subsequently amended, restated and consolidated in June 2012. We amended the consolidated license agreement in November 2012 to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover additional nitric oxide technologies in consideration for an upfront cash payment. We may obtain similar amendments to the consolidated license agreement to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover future additional nitric oxide technologies or as improvements on licensed technology and, if such amendments were executed, we may be required to pay additional upfront cash payments. In April 2016, we amended the agreement to clarify the scope of the intellectual property of the consolidated license agreement.
Under the consolidated license agreement with UNC, we are granted an exclusive, worldwide license, with the ability to sublicense, under the licensed UNC patents, including those directed to Nitricil compounds, to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology. As partial consideration for the consolidated license agreement, we issued 191,052 shares of our common stock to UNC and a nominal upfront cash payment. Additionally, under the consolidated license agreement, we are obligated to pay UNC a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products (by us or any of our sublicensees, such as Sato), and to pay up to $425,000 to UNC in regulatory and commercial milestones on a licensed product by licensed product basis.
Under the consolidated license agreement, UNC controls prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents owned solely by UNC, we control prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents jointly owned by us and UNC and we are obligated to reimburse UNC for reasonable prosecution and maintenance costs. Pursuant to the consolidated license agreement, we have the first right to defend against third-party claims of patent infringement with respect to the licensed products and to enforce the licensed patents against third-party infringers.
13

Unless earlier terminated by us at our election, or if we materially breach the agreement or become bankrupt, the consolidated license agreement remains in effect on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis until the expiration of the last to expire issued patent covering such licensed product in the applicable country, and upon such expiration, we receive a perpetual, unrestricted, fully-paid and royalty free right to develop and commercialize such licensed product in such country. As of December 31, 2018, the last to expire issued patent licensed to us under the consolidated license agreement is projected to expire in 2033. UNC may terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive for our material breach of the agreement that remains uncured after 90 days of receipt of written notice thereof from UNC and may also terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive upon providing written notice for our bankruptcy or insolvency-related events within 30 days of the occurrence of such events. We may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon providing written notice of not less than 30 days to UNC.
Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements with KNOW Bio, including Amendments
2015 Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements
In connection with the December 2015 separation of our non-dermatology assets to KNOW Bio, we granted to KNOW Bio, through two separate agreements, exclusive licenses, with the right to sublicense, to certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the agreement, and, under one of the agreements, patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of such agreement, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics. 
Under the exclusive licenses, the following rights were retained by Novan or conveyed to KNOW Bio:

• | Novan retained exclusive development and commercialization rights in all fields for any products containing certain specified particles, referred to as the Novan Particles, including those in our NVN1000 API and in other NCEs we are developing for the GI therapeutic area.


• | Novan retained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology in the Retained Dermatology Field, which is defined as the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and palliation of diseases, conditions, or disorders of the skin, nails, hair or scalp in humans or animals, and all cosmetic uses for the skin, nails, hair or scalp, other than (i) for wound care through formulations of therapeutic product specifically designed to treat chronic wounds, thermal burns, radiation injury, accidental injury, surgical sites or scars, and (ii) therapeutic uses for treating cancer, excluding basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, precancerous conditions of the skin, actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis, cutaneous horn, Bowen disease, radiation dermatosis, and dysplastic nevi. The Retained Dermatology Field was amended in 2017 as described in the section entitled “2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements.”


• | KNOW Bio received exclusive right to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology, excluding products containing the Novan Particles, in the KNOW Bio Field, which is defined as all fields of use except for the Retained Dermatology Field. The KNOW Bio Field was amended in 2017 as described in the section entitled “2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements.”

Under one of these exclusive license agreements, KNOW Bio granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of such agreement and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, for use in the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and palliation of diseases, conditions, or disorders in the Retained Dermatology Field, including but not limited to SB204, SB206, SB208, SB414 and our other presently-contemplated dermatology pipeline candidates. KNOW Bio granted us a right of first negotiation to obtain a license under any patents and patent applications generated by KNOW Bio during the first three years following the execution date of the agreement and directed towards medical devices to develop and commercialize licensed products in the Retained Dermatology Field. Additionally, Novan and KNOW Bio also agreed that neither party would commercialize any products in the other’s field of use during the first three years following the execution date of the agreement. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications controlled by us are added to the exclusive license and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018. Neither we nor, to our knowledge, KNOW Bio commercialized a product in the other party’s field during this period.
Additionally, we granted to KNOW Bio exclusive sublicenses, with the ability to further sublicense, under certain of the U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications exclusively licensed to us from UNC and another third party directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions, including certain Nitricil compounds, to develop and commercialize products utilizing the 
14

licensed technology in the KNOW Bio Field. Under the exclusive sublicense to the UNC patents and applications, KNOW Bio is subject to the terms and conditions under the consolidated license agreement with UNC, including diligence obligations and milestone payment obligations.
Under the exclusive license agreements and sublicense agreements, we retain all rights under our owned and exclusively licensed patents and patent applications with respect to development and commercialization of products for use in the Retained Dermatology Field. The exclusive license agreements and sublicense agreements will continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the respective agreement, unless earlier terminated, and upon expiration continues as a perpetual non-exclusive license. Under each agreement, Novan and KNOW Bio have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice for the other party’s material breach which remains uncured within 30 days of receipt of notice thereof. Novan also has the right to terminate each such agreement immediately upon written notice if KNOW Bio, its affiliates or sublicensees challenge the validity of any patent licensed in such agreement. KNOW Bio has the right to terminate each such agreement, with notice, for any reason upon ninety days advance written notice to the Company. The licenses granted by KNOW Bio to the Company in the agreements survive termination of the agreements.
For additional information about the Separation Transaction, please see the “Note 2—KNOW Bio, LLC” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements
In October 2017, we entered into certain amendments, or the KNOW Bio Amendments, to the original license and sublicense agreements described above between us and KNOW Bio, or the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the KNOW Bio Amendments, we re-acquired from KNOW Bio exclusive, worldwide rights under certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, and patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, to develop and commercialize products for all diagnostic, therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses for any disease, condition or disorder caused by certain oncoviruses, or the Oncovirus Field. KNOW Bio also granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, to develop and commercialize products for use in the Oncovirus Field. Additionally, KNOW Bio agreed that KNOW Bio would not commercialize any products in the Oncovirus Field during the first three years following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications controlled by KNOW Bio are added to the exclusive license and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018. 
The rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field in the KNOW Bio Amendments continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the Agreements, and upon expiration continue on a perpetual non-exclusive basis, and are subject to the termination rights of KNOW Bio and us that are set forth in the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. In addition, under the KNOW Bio Amendments, KNOW Bio may terminate the rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field if: (i) we do not file a first IND application with the FDA for a product in the Oncovirus Field by October 2020; or (ii) we do not file a first NDA with the FDA by October 2025 for a product in the Oncovirus Field and do not otherwise have any active clinical programs related to the Oncovirus Field at such time.
Additional terms, including our financial obligations, under the KNOW Bio Amendments are described in further detail in “Note 2—KNOW Bio, LLC” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
15

U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit marketing of the product for particular indications for uses in the United States.

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. To support an IND to conduct clinical trials, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND submission. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.

16


• | Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.


• | Phase 4 clinical trials: In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. In some cases, these Phase 4 studies are made a condition of approval of the NDA.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all and favorable results in an earlier clinical or preclinical trial may not predict the outcomes of subsequent trials. Clinical trials may be delayed for a variety of reasons including unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, slow enrollment of subjects, unexpected shortages in the drug product, or other reasons. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications for use. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision as to whether it will accept the application for filing. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. During its review, the FDA may raise additional issues or request additional data or information, during which time, the review period is generally suspended until such requests are received. This can delay, sometimes substantially, the FDA’s review and potential approval of an application.
17

The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs or if unexpected safety or efficacy concerns arise. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law. The Act is intended, among other things, to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and to encourage innovation.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. The review period may be suspended if the FDA requests additional information which may extend the timeline for review. Many products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate 
18

endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures in certain instances based on these studies.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval and approval is not guaranteed. Such designation may, however, expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also limit the indications for use or may impose labeling or other requirements on the product.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, by us or any potential commercial partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Manufacturing and Supplies
We currently manufacture all drug substance, including NVN1000 (the API for all of our clinical stage product candidates), at our facility in Morrisville, North Carolina. In 2017, we also began manufacturing all drug product materials at our Morrisville, North Carolina facility, for use in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials.
We manufacture our investigational materials in accordance with cGMP required by the FDA, International Committee on Harmonization and other regulatory bodies. While our facilities have been audited by third-parties for cGMP and GLP compliance, we have not been audited by the FDA. In addition, our drug substance manufacturing processes and operating conditions have been evaluated and tested by qualified vendors to ensure a safe operating environment. These tests include raw materials and product handling, process chemistry, air quality and waste disposal and containment.
We have selected a preferred contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to manufacture our API upon completion of the transfer of manufacturing processes and analytical methods. In March 2019, we signed a letter of intent with a full-scale API manufacturer, a CMO, for the production of our proprietary drug substance. The scope of this initial letter of intent includes the process and analytical method transfer necessary to advance the development and large-scale manufacture of our drug substance.
In October 2018, we established a strategic alliance with Orion Corporation, or Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in manufacturing. The alliance enables Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on the behalf of our global strategic partners. We have executed a master contract manufacturing agreement to enable technology transfer and manufacturing of clinical trial materials for future clinical trials with our topical product candidates. We plan to transfer the technology for the manufacture of SB204 and intend for Orion to be able to manufacture the drug product, or the finished dosage form of the gel, in accordance with our established manufacturing processes, in compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines, as appropriate for clinical trials and alongside our current internal manufacturing capabilities. While the initial framework of the agreement enables the manufacture of SB204, the companies plan to evaluate expanding the agreement to include other product candidates for the manufacture of clinical trial materials and, potentially, commercial quantities. Importantly, this alliance is intended to support major global markets in which we and our partners pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates and complements our present internal capability.

We intend for these, or potentially other, third parties to supply drug substance and drug product materials to support commercialization of any of our product candidates, subject to FDA approval. In such cases, they may be the primary suppliers for these product candidates. Our relationships with the aforementioned third-party manufacturers are integral to our operating strategy which includes an increased utilization of and reliance upon third party vendors and strategic partners for the performance of activities, processes and services that (i) do not result in the generation of significant new intellectual property and (ii) can leverage existing robust infrastructure, systems, and facilities as well as associated subject matter expertise. Our strategic objective is to reduce our own internal resources, facilities, and infrastructure of capabilities that have historically performed such activities, processes and services. While we will incur certain discrete costs as we transition to this new operating strategy, we believe it will ultimately provide operating efficiencies and allow us to direct a greater portion of our capital towards the generation of new technologies and intellectual property.
We currently rely on third-party suppliers to provide the raw materials that are used by us or our third-party manufacturers in the manufacture of our drugs. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, including nitric oxide, that we use to manufacture our drugs.
