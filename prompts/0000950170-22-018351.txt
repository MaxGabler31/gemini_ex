 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses, where our people and other assets provide a competitive advantage. We currently have two business operating segments: durable medical equipment and investment management with general corporate representing unallocated costs and activity to arrive at consolidated operations.
 Our goal is to build a diversified holding company focused on generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns on investment and long-term value creation. We intend to accomplish this principally through:
 ▪continuous review of acquisitions of businesses, securities and assets that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and exhibit the potential for significant long-term value creation;
 ▪expanding and further diversifying assets under management by acquiring management rights to additional permanent or long-dated capital vehicles;
 ▪effective use of the skills of our team and our financial resources, including our tax assets, our willingness to create bespoke solutions and our ability to prudently assume risks; and
 ▪constant evaluation of the retention and disposition of our operations and holdings.
 As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $821 million of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes. The federal NOL carryforwards generated prior to fiscal year 2018 will expire from 2022 through 2037. The federal NOL carryforwards generated in fiscal year 2018 or later may be carried forward indefinitely.
 Our Durable Medical Equipment Business
 We launched our durable medical equipment segment in September 2018 by acquiring two durable medical equipment businesses that specialize in the distribution of respiratory care equipment, including positive air pressure (PAP) equipment and supplies, ventilators and oxygen equipment, and provide sleep study services. Since then, we have grown the business organically through investments in scalability as well as inorganically through tuck-in acquisitions.
Our Investment Management Business
 We decided to invest in the asset management business because of our assessment of its ability to generate recurring free cash flows, its growth prospects and our Board of Directors’ (our Board) and employees’ industry expertise. GECM, our wholly-owned registered investment adviser subsidiary, is an investment adviser providing investment management services to GECC and Monomoy REIT, our largest investment vehicles, as well as private funds, including the Great Elm SPAC Opportunity Fund, LLC (GESOF), and separate accounts for an institutional investor. The combined assets under management for these entities as of June 30, 2022 was approximately $607.0 million.
 GECC was established in 2016 and it elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). We own approximately 35.4% of GECC’s shares that we may hold to generate dividends or sell to redeploy our capital in higher yielding opportunities.
 Monomoy REIT was formed in 2014 with the purpose of building an industry leading single-tenant industrial portfolio specializing in net leased assets, specifically Class B & C warehouse, distribution & light manufacturing assets. The Company acquired the investment management agreement of Monomoy REIT in May 2022. The Company and its subsidiaries collectively own approximately 10.5% of Monomoy Properties UpREIT, LLC, the operating partnership of Monomoy REIT (Monomoy UpREIT).
GECM earns revenue through investment management agreements with each investment vehicle which provide for management fees, property management fees, incentive fees and/or administrative fees. These fees are generally based on assets under management, rent collected, investment performance and allocable expenses incurred in the administration of these investment vehicles.
Discontinued Operations
 We launched our real estate business in March 2018 with an investment in a majority-interest in two Class A office buildings totaling 257,000 square feet situated on 17 acres of land in Fort Myers, Florida (collectively, the Property). The Property was fully-leased, on a triple-net basis, to a single tenant through March 31, 2030. In June 2021, we sold the real estate business.

 Holding Company Reorganization
On December 21, 2020, Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (GEC) announced plans to create a new public holding company, Great Elm Group, Inc. by implementing a non-taxable holding company reorganization (the Holding Company Reorganization). Following the Holding Company Reorganization, the Company became the successor issuer to GEC.
 On December 29, 2020, we completed a reorganization of our corporate structure, where GEC changed its name to Forest Investments, Inc. (Forest) and became a wholly owned subsidiary of GEG. Outstanding shares of Forest under the ticker symbol “GEC” were automatically converted into shares of our common stock, ticker symbol “GEG”. Forest's common stock was then delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and subsequently deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The Holding Company Reorganization was a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our shareholders.
Financing Transaction
 Following the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, J.P. Morgan Broker-Dealer Holdings, Inc. (JPM), a Delaware corporation and affiliate of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Forest and the Company agreed to effect certain transactions pursuant to which JPM provided financing in an aggregate amount of $37.7 million.
 In connection with such financing, among other things:
 •Forest issued to JPM 35,010 newly issued shares of 9.0% preferred stock (the Forest Preferred Stock) with a maturity date of December 29, 2027 for $1,000.00 per share;
 •Great Elm Healthcare, LLC (HC LLC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Elm DME, Inc. (DME Inc.), and sole owner of the durable medical equipment operating subsidiaries, issued 10,090 newly issued shares of 9.0% Series A-1 preferred stock (the Series A-1 Preferred Stock) with a maturity date of December 29, 2027 and face value of $1,000.00 per share to the owners of DME Inc., which in turn distributed such preferred stock pro rata to the holders of its common stock such that 80.1% of such preferred stock is held by Forest, 9.95% is held by Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P. (Corbel), and 9.95% is held by Valley Healthcare Group, LLC (VHG). Upon a sale of the durable medical equipment business, such holders of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are only entitled to their liquidation preference;
 •HC LLC issued to Forest 34,010 newly issued shares of 9.0% Series A-2 preferred stock (the Series A-2 Preferred Stock) with a maturity date of December 29, 2027 for $1,000.00 per share. Upon a sale of the durable medical equipment business, such holders of Series A-2 Preferred Stock are entitled to the greater of their liquidation preference or 33% of proceeds arising from such sale;
 •HC LLC distributed to the owners of DME Inc. cash of $1.9 million and reimbursed the Company $1.3 million to cover deal costs;
 •Forest distributed to the Company, its sole stockholder, all of the assets and liabilities of Forest other than certain excluded assets and related liabilities, including Forest’s real estate business, and a preferred investment in the Company’s durable medical equipment business; and
 •JPM acquired 20% of Forest’s common stock for a purchase price of $2.7 million. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, DME Manager, concurrently entered into an agreement with Forest to provide advisory services in exchange for annual consulting fees of $0.45 million. 
 (each collectively noted above, the JPM Transactions).
 Using proceeds from the JPM Transactions, DME Inc. paid off the term loan with Corbel (the Corbel Facility).
 Subsidiary Reorganization
 On May 31, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc. exchanged its 80.1% interests in DME Inc. for an identical 80.1% direct interest in DME Inc.’s subsidiary HC LLC, which is the sole owner of the durable medical equipment operating subsidiaries. Following the consummation of the reorganization, we no longer have an interest in DME Inc.
 

On June 29, 2021, GP Corp. assigned the rights to a profit sharing agreement with GECM, their intercompany obligation under a senior secured note payable issued by GP Corp. and other assets and liabilities to their wholly-owned subsidiary Great Elm Capital GP, LLC (GEC GP). Subsequent to the assignment, we exchanged our 98.2% interests in GP Corp. for an identical 98.2% direct interest in GP Corp.’s wholly-owned subsidiary GEC GP. Following the consummation of the reorganization, the Company no longer has an interest in GP Corp.
 CARES Act Stimulus
 During the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company and its subsidiaries recognized benefits related to stimulus received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act initially passed into law on March 27, 2020 and subsequently expanded (CARES Act) of $2.4 million and $4.8 million, respectively, consisting of employee retention payroll tax credits.
Acquisition Program
 Great Elm’s team continues to monitor and identify opportunities in the durable medical equipment, investment management and other sectors through the acquisition of operating businesses. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we evaluated a number of opportunities in these areas.
Competition
 We face competition from larger, well financed organizations (both domestic and foreign), including operating companies, global asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises. Government regulation is a key competitive factor for certain industries.
Employees
 We had 381 employees as of June 30, 2022, including the 360 employees of our durable medical equipment subsidiaries.
