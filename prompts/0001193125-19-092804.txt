ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Anaplan is pioneering the category of Connected Planning, which allows organizations to transform their businesses by making better and faster decisions. 
 We believe Connected Planning is the next essential cloud category. It fundamentally transforms planning by connecting all of the people, data, and plans needed to accelerate business value and enable real-time planning and decision-making in rapidly changing business environments. Connected Planning accelerates business value by transforming the way organizations make decisions and placing the power of planning in the hands of every individual at every level within and between organizations. 
 Connected Planning represents a fundamental shift from the legacy approach to planning, which is typically confined to the finance department and uses a patchwork of outdated and disconnected tools and manual processes that are often overly complex, slow, inefficient, and static. Connected Planning enables dynamic, collaborative, and intelligent planning across all areas of an organization, including finance, sales, and supply chain, and other corporate functions such as marketing, human resources, and operations. 
 Our cloud platform is a complete end-to-end solution that addresses the Connected Planning needs of all organizations with a focus on the largest global enterprises. We define large global enterprises as companies included in the Forbes Global 2000, or the Global 2000, an annual ranking of the largest public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. We empower customers to quickly and easily build models to address their most complex business challenges. Our powerful modeling engine, which is based on our proprietary Hyperblock technology, enables thousands of concurrent users to access a centralized single source of information for planning, ensuring the consistency, quality, and integrity of the data. Our innovative in-memory architecture allows customers to rapidly run alternative scenarios to understand the impact of changes in business assumptions. This functionality allows users to view and assess the impact of assumptions on plans and key performance indicators in real time. Our platform also leverages predictive analytics to produce actionable intelligence that gives our customers a competitive advantage. We continue to invest in artificial intelligence, including machine learning, to further enhance the predictive capabilities of our platform. 
 Our proprietary Hyperblock technology is at the core of our platform and was purpose-built for Connected Planning. This powerful in-memory modeling engine leverages 64-bit multi-core parallel processors to deliver calculations on a massive amount of data at very high speed in real time. Our platform unites traditionally distinct or disconnected database structures, including relational, columnar, and online analytical processing, or OLAP, with in-memory data storage and calculation. Our flexible data structure enables users to easily build and modify complex multi-dimensional models in a single modeling environment, scaling to thousands of concurrent users. Together, these technologies enable flexible modeling, widespread collaboration, and rapid calculation and iteration. As a result, our platform provides insights that were previously unavailable. We strive for continuous improvement of our patent portfolio and research and development capabilities. 
 We put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. As thought leaders in Connected Planning, we have developed deep domain expertise and best practices that are crucial in addressing our customers planning challenges. By aligning our thought leadership, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers Connected Planning journeys. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing our Connected Planning vision and driving continued expansion in the use of our platform.

 We focus our selling efforts on executives of large enterprises, who are often making a strategic purchase of our platform with the potential for broad use throughout their organizations. We use a land and expand sales strategy to capitalize on this potential. Our platform is often initially adopted within a specific line of business, including in finance, sales, and supply chain, and other corporate functions such as marketing, human resources, and operations, for one or more planning use cases. Once customers see the benefits of our platform for their initial use cases, they often increase the number of users, add new use cases, and expand to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. This expansion often generates a natural network effect in which the value of our platform increases as more use cases are adopted, more users are connected, and greater amounts of data are incorporated in our platform. 
 As of January 31, 2019, over 1,100 customers were using our platform. Of these, over 250, are members of the Global 2000, which we believe presents our greatest growth opportunity. The success of our land and expand strategy is validated by the expansion we have experienced in the use of our platform by our largest customers and by our dollar-based net expansion rates. Our top 25 customers by average annual recurring revenue as of January 31, 2019, had average annual recurring revenue of approximately $2.8 million, compared to the average annual recurring revenue represented by their initial purchase of approximately $0.3 million. In addition, our annual dollar-based net expansion rate for Anaplan as a whole was approximately 123%, 122%, and 123% as of the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of how we calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate. The number of customers with greater than $250,000 of annual recurring revenue was 248, 181, and 113 as of the end of fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. While achieving and maintaining incremental sales to existing customers requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts, the introduction of new features and functionality to our platform, and customers realizing benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, we believe we have significant opportunities to further expand the use of our platform by our existing customers as well as to attract additional large customers. 
 We sell our cloud platform primarily through our direct sales team. We also have a broad network of consulting and implementation partners to extend our customer reach and help accelerate the sale and delivery of our platform as a supplement to our direct sales force. Our global partners, including global strategic consulting firms and global systems integrators, often promote our platform as their clients examine how to plan more effectively to achieve organizational transformation or improve business processes. We also partner with leading regional consulting firms and implementation partners. These highly skilled regional partners not only provide subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases, but they also act as an extension of our direct sales force by identifying and referring opportunities to us. We and our partners create pre-packaged applications that are available on our App Hub marketplace to further accelerate the adoption and expansion of our platform. We continue to invest in on-going training of our partners to ensure that our customers have access to high-caliber partners who are well-versed in our latest technology. 
 For financial information regarding our business, see Part II-Item 7-Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report and our consolidated audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Industry Background 
 Existing planning processes are broken in a number of fundamental ways: 
 Planning Has Been Centralized 
 The pace of disruption is accelerating and competitive advantage is inextricably linked with the ability to be proactive, fast, and agile. Traditionally, planning has been confined to dedicated planners within the finance department. Organizations are now decentralizing decision-making by empowering 
 
6 


  departmental leaders, regional heads, and individual employees to make decisions based on the corporate strategy and business realities they observe. It has become critically important to have visibility and collaboration across the whole organization to facilitate quicker, more informed, and more effective decision-making. 
 Planning Has Been Backward-Looking 
 One of the major limitations of effective planning has been its focus on the past rather than the future. Organizations have often attempted to plan and iterate future scenarios but have been constrained by their inability to incorporate current, consistent, and accurate data in a timely manner. Therefore, planners, in the interest of time, often simply look back at past performance and apply a sub-optimal adjustment to create a plan for the future. 
 Planning Processes Have Been Manual and Slow, Relying on Stale and Inaccurate Information 
 Many organizations are still using a patchwork of outdated tools, including decentralized manual processes managed through spreadsheets and other point products. These processes often rely on contradictory and stale data and cannot deliver real-time insights across organizations. These tools often remain siloed and disconnected without cohesive organization-wide planning capabilities. As a result, organizations have highly inefficient, labor-intensive processes that significantly impair their organizational visibility and decision-making speed. 
Modern Technology Has Not Been Leveraged in the Planning Process 
 Cloud architecture brings a vast number of improvements over legacy on-premises software, including faster deployment, greater scalability, increased reliability, easier maintenance, and increased collaboration. Mobile devices and ubiquitous internet connectivity are enabling people to work wherever, whenever, and however they want. Integration technologies, such as application programming interfaces, or APIs, and connectors, enable users to connect different types of data and applications rapidly and reliably without requiring long and expensive systems integration projects. 
 In addition, while software technologies have been packaged for specific use cases, the planning process requires a comprehensive, unified platform that can efficiently and dynamically address planning across functional areas and lines of business. Many of the products packaged for specific use cases merely assemble existing technologies to serve functions for which they were not originally designed. Given that these products were not designed from inception as a unified platform for planning, they inherit the same performance limitations and bottlenecks of the existing technologies from which they were assembled. In contrast, a platform designed from inception to support emerging capabilities, such as those made possible by machine learning and artificial intelligence, can enable further insights into organizational behaviors and shape better predictions about the future. 
 Planning Processes Were Not Designed to Take Advantage of the Large Amount of Data Available Today 
 Big data and cloud computing have led to an explosion in available data, providing access to more real-time information than ever before. Business-related data includes both internal information, such as sales pipelines, financial information, employee data, and product configurations, as well as external data, including pricing trends, economic data, and supply chain logistics. Not only does this information often exist in organizational silos or disparate databases, but there are often competing versions of the same data. Organizations today realize the need to take advantage of available data, in all its complexity, volume, and variety. Organizations can make better informed decisions if they have a consistent source of information that enables them to extract insights. Increasingly, technology exists to integrate and manage this data to provide a single, consistent source of information. By collecting, integrating, analyzing, and using this high-quality data, organizations can compress the time needed to adapt and revise their strategies and business operations.

 Planning Technology Has Been Dependent on IT Departments 
 As people have become accustomed to highly intuitive, easy-to-use consumer applications, they want to enjoy the same user-friendly experiences with the software they use at work. Historically, employees who wanted to make changes to planning analyses or reports did not have the necessary coding skills, so they would submit the request to IT departments for new reports, items, or analyses adding in some cases days, weeks, or months to the time needed to make mission-critical decisions. Today, organizations want a planning platform that enables every user, without the assistance of IT personnel, to rapidly build models, easily interact with and gain insights from their data, and holistically collaborate with peers across their organization. 
Existing Offerings/Products/Technology Do Not Meet the Needs of Organizations or Employees 
 Legacy Planning Products 
 Legacy planning products are typically siloed, on-premises solutions, or cloud-enabled adaptations of on-premises solutions, designed to address the limited scope of historical planning approaches, and have the following limitations: 
 

 | Not Dynamic. Legacy planning products tend to be static, and do not allow for the rapid iteration of scenarios that can produce the greatest insight into the impact of planning assumptions. They typically require lengthy implementations and substantial capital and operating investments in IT infrastructure to customize and integrate with other data and applications. On-premises, legacy planning products also require periodic maintenance upgrades, resulting in more delays, costs, and inconsistent versions across departments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Not Collaborative. Legacy planning products typically are siloed by department, and reside only in the hands of specialists. They require significant training and expertise of dedicated business analysts, limiting who can participate in planning. Changes in analysis, reporting, and other modifications typically require coding by IT personnel, often taking weeks or months to implement. These products were not designed for users within and across organizations to share data, collaborate, and draw holistic conclusions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Not Intelligent. Legacy planning products are not well-equipped to enable actionable insights from plans. These products often do not provide the comprehensive set of advanced predictive analytics and optimization tools necessary to drive highly informed decision-making. This paradigm may have been acceptable when business cycles were slower and more predictable, but business leaders in todays environment need products with greater intelligence. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Emerging Point Products 
 Emerging point products are typically designed to address a narrow set of pre-defined use cases such as sales performance management, financial planning, or forecasting. The limitations of these products include: 
 

 | Siloed Analyses. These products often can only provide answers to specific, standard questions using a confined data set. They also often lack broader organizational context and understanding and are difficult to integrate with other systems and data across the organization. These shortcomings require organizations to acquire and manage multiple point products and pair them with manual processes to generate more holistic plans. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cannot Effectively Model. To effectively model, a solution must help users understand the impact that changes in assumptions have on forecasted goals. These products are often unable to quickly run and re-run alternative planning scenarios requiring a large amount of data from across the organization to produce the insights necessary to forecast effectively. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
8 


 
 | Lack of Platform Capabilities. Emerging point products were typically not built as platforms and therefore do not enable users to build an expanding number of models to address use cases across the organization. As a result, organizations using these products often must buy multiple products for various lines of business and use cases across the organization. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Difficulty Scaling. Emerging point products are primarily suitable for small and medium-sized businesses. Often these solutions are not built to handle the demands of large global enterprises and cannot scale efficiently and effectively. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual Processes 
 In many organizations, data is primarily gathered, maintained, and updated using individual, static, and manual productivity tools and processes, which we collectively refer to as manual processes. These processes are most often managed through spreadsheets. The limitations of these processes include: 

 | Error Prone. Manual processes are error prone. For example, spreadsheet modeling logic is contained at the level of individual cells, rather than at a higher abstraction layer. Errors or changes in calculation formulas are very common and extremely time-consuming and are difficult to identify and correct, causing significant delays and lost productivity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited Scalability. Manual process tools such as spreadsheets and other documents, databases, and emails cannot effectively manage enterprise-sized data or execute calculations at the scale that large businesses often require. Often these individual files become so large that they need to be split into numerous sheets or documents, requiring complex links to be built and maintained. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lack of Collaboration. Users are typically required to collaborate by attaching their documents to emails, then manually relinking cells and sheets. This process is highly manual, less secure than an enterprise platform, time consuming, error prone, and often results in people working with stale data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lack of Relevant Information. Users will often lack the breadth of information required to make informed decisions, or only have access to stale, incomplete, or incorrect data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Lack of Data Governance and Security. Using individual productivity tools lacking a central data hub means that data often is lost or compromised. The information is difficult to audit since individuals choose how data is disseminated without reference to an organizations preferred permissions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Market Opportunity 
 We address a very large existing market of legacy and emerging business software categories, recognized by market research studies. According to International Data Corporation, or IDC, the worldwide performance management and analytic applications software market is forecasted to be approximately $17 billion in 2018 and to grow to $21 billion by 2021. This market includes applications for customer relationship management, workforce management, supply chain management, production planning, services operations, and enterprise performance management. 
 Based on our experience with customers, however, we believe we address a greater opportunity not yet quantified by current market research studies because we are also disrupting numerous manual processes and tools traditionally used in enterprise planning. According to a 2018 study that we commissioned from Nucleus Research, Inc., a market research services firm, there are approximately 72 million workers worldwide who are potential users of our platform.

 We put the success of our customers at the center of our culture, strategy, and investments. We view our Customer First strategy as core to capturing our Connected Planning vision and driving continued expansion in the use of our platform. As thought leaders in Connected Planning, we have developed deep domain expertise and best practices that are crucial to addressing our customers and partners planning challenges. By aligning our thought leadership, worldwide development and delivery capabilities, and local sales and service resources, our Customer First strategy drives exceptional value throughout our customers Connected Planning journeys. We also ensure that our partner community supporting our customers is fully versed in this philosophy through our training academy, the Anaplan Academy. As part of our Customer First strategy, we created our customer success team dedicated to delivering an exceptional customer experience designed to foster rapid adoption, ease of doing business with us, high engagement, and strong customer retention and expansion. 
Our Customers 
 As of January 31, 2019, we served over 1,100 customers, including over 250 Global 2000 companies, in 49 countries. 
 Our customers include leading businesses in a diverse set of industries, including financial services, professional services, technology, energy, consumer goods, manufacturing, healthcare, media, retail, and transportation, as well as government agencies. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2019. 
 Our customers are passionate about our platform. We have created a program for select users to receive status as Master Anaplanners. These individuals have volunteered their own time to become identified experts on our platform and frequently promote Anaplan within their organizations and evangelize the benefits of our platform to prospective customers. 
 Our Culture and Employees 
 Our culture is the foundation of everything we do. We strive to foster a productive and engaging work environment that embodies our core values: openness, authenticity, inclusiveness, collaboration, and creativity. We put our customers first, and we focus on being tenacious, passionate and bold. Our talent strategy is aligned with our business vision for long-term growth and our innovative platform strategy. We hire those who have a passion for disrupting the current planning technology paradigm, enabling our customers to dramatically improve real-time decision-making in their businesses and drive visibility into analysis and deep planning into organizations. 
 As of January 31, 2019, we employed 1,299 people. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our platform primarily through our direct sales team targeting large enterprises, which we define as those companies comprising the Global 2000. We have also developed strategic partnerships and relationships to source leads, provide consulting, training and implementation services and drive thought leadership in promoting Connected Planning. To accelerate the adoption of

  our platform, we and our partners create pre-packaged applications that are available on our App Hub marketplace. We intend to continue to showcase applications and use cases on our App Hub. We also encourage our partners and customers to publish the use cases they have developed on our App Hub to generate user interest. We also create and share best practices, road maps for success and advice on how to accelerate and optimize Connected Planning. 
 Our partnerships provide us with a significant source of lead generation and implementation leverage. These partners use our platform to build mission-critical applications for their clients to demonstrate thought leadership and provide solutions to complex modeling, forecasting, and planning problems. We also host annual Anaplan Connected Planning Xperience (CPX) user conferences, previously known as Hub, to connect existing and potential customers, share best practices, and reinforce our brand. 
 Partnerships and Strategic Relationships 
 We have developed a broad network of individuals at consulting and implementation partners to extend our customer reach, assist in implementation of our platform, develop solutions on our platform, and help accelerate the sale and delivery of our platform as a supplement to our direct sales force, including: 

 | Global Partners. We partner with global strategic consulting firms and global system integrators that act as strategic advisors to senior executives in corporate, functional, and process transformation initiatives of organizations. These partners promote Anaplans platform as part of the large-scale transformation projects they drive by identifying opportunities in which our platform can help companies maximize the effectiveness of their business processes. Global system integrators also help us scale our sales and implementation delivery capacity globally by leveraging their trained staff. We believe engagements by those strategic partners lend themselves to Connected Planning because they frequently involve their clients re-examining how they can plan more dynamically and effectively as part of their transformations to support their strategic goals.

 | Regional Partners. We also partner with leading regional consulting firms and implementation partners. Our implementation partners are highly skilled and trained by our team and often have deep subject-matter expertise in the implementation of specific use cases. These partners also act as an extension of our direct sales force by identifying and referring opportunities to us. Our strategy is to enable the implementation of a majority of our projects to be led by regional partners, with supplemental application support from us.

Our research and development organization is primarily responsible for design, development, testing, and delivery of our products and platform. We focus our efforts on developing core technologies, as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, mobility, reliability, performance, and flexibility of our platform.

 Competition 
 The market for Connected Planning solutions is new and characterized by rapid technology innovation. To our knowledge, there are no other companies that service the breadth of use cases or the varying enterprise needs that we do. In many cases, our primary competition is manual, often spreadsheet-driven, processes and custom-built approaches. In addition, we compete with certain applications of large software companies, including legacy vendors such as Oracle, SAP, and IBM, that offer on-premises applications sold on a perpetual license and maintenance basis, as well as cloud software versions adapted from on-premises applications. We also compete with emerging vendors of applications focused on a specific department or use case, such as sales performance management and financial planning. We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom may be our current technology partners. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
 Technology and platform capabilities, including: 
 

 | enterprise-grade scalability;
--+------------------------------


 | breadth of capabilities within a single modeling environment;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | intuitive and user-friendly interface;

 | predictive algorithms and modeling capabilities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | configurability and agility in complex, enterprise-grade, planning environments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market leadership and customer success orientation, including: 
 

 | involvement in growing the category of Connected Planning;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | thought leadership and best practices, from example models to roadmaps for success;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established, proven success;

--+---------------------------------


 | customer-centric approach and focus;
--+-------------------------------------

--+--------------------

 We believe that we compare favorably with respect to each of these factors.
