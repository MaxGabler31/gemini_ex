Overview
MSG Entertainment is a leader in live entertainment comprised of iconic venues, marquee entertainment brands, regional sports and entertainment networks, popular dining and nightlife offerings, and a premier music festival. As of June 30, 2022, we managed our business through three operating segments:
Entertainment: This segment includes the Company’s portfolio of venues: Madison Square Garden (“The Garden”), Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden (“Hulu Theater”), Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, and The Chicago Theatre. In addition, the Company has unveiled its vision for state-of-the-art venues, called MSG Sphere, and is currently building its first such venue in Las Vegas. The Entertainment segment also includes the original production, the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes (“Christmas Spectacular”), as well as Boston Calling Events, LLC (“BCE”), the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival. This segment also includes our bookings business, which features a variety of live entertainment and sports experiences.
MSG Networks: This segment is comprised of the Company’s regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG+, a companion streaming app, MSG GO, and other digital properties. MSG Networks serves the New York Designated Market Area, as well as other portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and features a wide range of sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the New York Knicks (the “Knicks”) of the National Basketball Association (the “NBA”) and the New York Rangers (the “Rangers”), New York Islanders (the “Islanders”), New Jersey Devils (the “Devils”) and Buffalo Sabres (the “Sabres”) of the National Hockey League (the “NHL”), as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants (the “Giants”) and Buffalo Bills (the “Bills”) of the National Football League (the “NFL”).
Tao Group Hospitality: This segment features the Company’s controlling interest in TAO Group Holdings LLC (“Tao Group Hospitality”), a hospitality group with globally-recognized entertainment dining and nightlife brands including: Tao, Marquee, Lavo, Beauty & Essex, Cathédrale, Hakkasan and Omnia. Tao Group Hospitality operates over 70 entertainment dining and nightlife branded locations within 60 venues in over 20 markets across five continents.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
The Company’s operations and operating results have been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (including COVID-19 variants) and actions taken in response by governmental authorities and certain professional sports leagues during 
Fiscal Years 2020, 2021 and 2022. For the majority of Fiscal Year 2021, substantially all operations of the Entertainment business were suspended, MSG Networks aired substantially fewer games and Tao Group Hospitality was operating at significantly reduced capacity and demand. Fiscal Year 2022 was also impacted by the pandemic, with fewer ticketed events at our venues in the first half of the fiscal year as compared with Fiscal Year 2019 (the last full fiscal year not impacted by COVID-19) due to the lead-time required to book touring acts and artists, and an increase in COVID-19 cases due to a new variant, which resulted in a number of events at our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues being cancelled or postponed in the second and third quarters.
As a result of government-mandated assembly limitations and closures, all of our performance venues were closed beginning in March 2020. Use of The Garden resumed for Knicks and Rangers home games without fans in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and was available at 10% seating capacity from February through May 2021 with certain safety protocols and social distancing. Beginning in May 2021, all of our New York performance venues were permitted to host guests at full capacity, subject to certain restrictions, and effective June 2021, The Chicago Theatre was permitted to host events without restrictions. Guests of our Chicago and New York venues were also subject to certain vaccination requirements until February and March 2022, respectively. As a result, our performance venues no longer require guests to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination before entering (although specific performers may require enhanced protocols). 
For Fiscal Year 2021, the majority of ticketed events at our venues were postponed or cancelled. For Fiscal Year 2022 and as of the date of this filing, live events have been permitted to be held at all of our performance venues and we are continuing to host and book new events. As a result of an increase in cases of a COVID-19 variant, select bookings were postponed or cancelled at our performance venues in the second and third quarters of Fiscal Year 2022. Variants of COVID-19 that arise in the future may result in additional postponements or cancellations of bookings at our performance venues.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations also included (i) the partial cancellation of the 2021 production of the Christmas Spectacular, (ii) the cancellation of the 2020 production of the Christmas Spectacular, and (iii) the cancellation of both the 2020 and 2021 Boston Calling Music Festival.
The Company has long-term arena license agreements (the “Arena License Agreements”) with MSG Sports that require the Knicks and Rangers to play their home games at The Garden. As discussed above, capacity restrictions, use limitations and social distancing requirements were in place for the entirety of the Knicks and Rangers 2020-21 regular seasons, which materially impacted the payments we received under the Arena License Agreements for Fiscal Year 2021. On July 1, 2021, the Knicks and Rangers began paying the full amounts provided for under their respective Arena License Agreements. The Knicks and the Rangers each completed their 2021-2022 82-game regular seasons, with the Rangers advancing to the playoffs.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and league and government actions relating thereto, MSG Networks aired substantially fewer NBA and NHL telecasts during Fiscal Year 2021, as compared with Fiscal Year 2019 (the last full fiscal year not impacted by COVID-19), and consequently experienced a decrease in revenues, including a material decrease in advertising revenue. The absence of live sports games also resulted in a decrease in certain MSG Networks expenses, including rights fees, variable production expenses, and advertising sales commissions. MSG Networks resumed airing full regular season telecast schedules in Fiscal Year 2022 for its five professional teams across both the NBA and NHL, and as a result, its advertising revenue and certain operating expenses, including rights fees expense, reflect the same.
Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant and negative impact on Tao Group Hospitality’s operations and financial performance for Fiscal Year 2021. Due to government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtually all of Tao Group Hospitality’s venues were closed for approximately three months starting in March 2020. Additionally, three venues were permanently closed. Throughout Fiscal Year 2021, Tao Group Hospitality conducted limited operations at certain venues, subject to significant regulatory requirements, including capacity limits, curfews and social distancing requirements for outdoor and indoor dining. During Fiscal Year 2022, Tao Group Hospitality’s operations were also impacted by an increase in COVID-19 cases due to a new variant, which resulted in reduced operating schedules and reduced demand from guests, including corporate and private event cancellations and postponements in the second and third quarters. As of the date of this filing, Tao Group Hospitality is operating without capacity restrictions in all markets. 
It is unclear to what extent ongoing COVID-19 concerns, including with respect to new variants, could result in new government or league-mandated capacity restrictions or vaccination/mask requirements or impact the use of and/or demand for our performance, entertainment dining and nightlife venues, demand for our sponsorship and advertising assets, deter our employees and vendors from working at our venues (which may lead to difficulties in staffing) or otherwise materially impact our operations.

•A strong and seasoned management team.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our Company’s portfolio of marquee assets and brands — which includes renowned venues, entertainment brands and regional sports and entertainment networks —to create world-class live experiences. This unique collection of assets, coupled with our deep relationships in the entertainment and sports industries, our strong connection with diverse and passionate audiences, and our continued commitment to innovation, are what set the Company apart and represent a substantial opportunity for growth.
Key components of our strategy include:
•A unique strategy for our performance venues. The Company has a collection of iconic performance venues through which we deliver live entertainment and sporting events. This portfolio includes The Garden, Hulu Theater, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, and The Chicago Theatre. These venues, along with our venue management capabilities, effective bookings strategies and proven expertise in sponsorships, marketing, ticketing and hospitality, have positioned the Company as an industry leader in live entertainment. We leverage our unique assets, expertise and approach to ensure we create unmatched experiences for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
In addition to our existing venues, the Company is currently building its first MSG Sphere venue in Las Vegas, on property connected by a pedestrian bridge to The Venetian Resort, which is expected to open in the second half of calendar year 2023. We believe MSG Sphere will become a venue for the next generation of entertainment, combining cutting-edge technology with multi-sensory storytelling to deliver immersive experiences at an unparalleled scale. 
◦Maximizing the live entertainment experience for our customers. We use our first-class operations, coupled with new innovations and our ability to attract top talent, to deliver unforgettable experiences for our guests — whether they are first-time visitors or repeat customers — ensuring they return to our venues. We have a track record of designing world-class facilities that exceed our customers’ expectations. This includes our renovations of The Garden, Radio City Music Hall, and the Beacon Theatre to deliver top-quality amenities such as state-of-the-art lighting, sound and staging, a full suite of hospitality offerings and enhanced premium products. In addition to better on-site amenities, we continue to explore new ways to utilize technology to improve the customer experience and create communities around our live events. From the way our customers buy their food and beverage, to how we market and process their tickets, and to the content we 
provide them to enhance their entertainment experience, we strive to give our customers the best experience in the industry. Our commitment to exceptional service and innovation will be elevated even further with the introduction of MSG Sphere — a venue that is being built from the ground up, to deliver an entirely new, fully immersive guest experience through the use of cutting-edge architectural, visual, audio and multi-sensory technologies. See “— Our Business — Our Performance Venues — MSG Sphere” for a description of the key design features of MSG Sphere that we believe will deliver this new guest experience.
◦Leveraging our live entertainment expertise to increase productivity across our performance venues. Part of what drives our success is our “artist first” approach, which has created significant growth at our venues over our history. Through dedicated artist areas and top-tier service, this talent-friendly environment not only attracts artists to our venues, but also brings them back for repeat performances. We will continue to use our “artist first” approach to attract the industry’s top talent with the goal of increasing utilization across all our venues through more multi-night and multi-market concerts and other events, including more recurring high-profile shows that help expand our base of events. Examples of this strategy include residencies featuring legendary performers playing our venues, which have included Billy Joel at The Garden and Jerry Seinfeld at the Beacon Theatre, as well as Phish’s Baker’s Dozen and the upcoming 15-night Harry Styles run, both at The Garden.
Another part of our “artist first” approach is how we use our diverse collection of venues. With seating capacities and configurations that range from 2,800 to 21,000, our venue pipeline enables us to shepherd an artist through their growth and development, helping us cultivate and develop deeper industry relationships. Examples of this include comedians Trevor Noah, Sebastian Maniscalco and John Mulaney, as well as artists including Brandi Carlile, Kacey Musgraves and Ben Platt, who all first performed at our theatres in New York and Chicago before headlining at The Garden. Our portfolio of venues also enables us to work with artists across multiple markets, further strengthening our partnerships as well as our opportunities for more extensive engagements.
◦Selectively expanding our performance venues in key music and entertainment markets. The Company is currently building its first MSG Sphere venue in Las Vegas, a venue for the next generation of entertainment. Due to the transformative nature of these venues, the Company believes there will be other markets — both domestic and international — where MSG Sphere can be successful. The design of MSG Sphere will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities — from large-scale to smaller and more intimate — based on the needs of the individual market. Operating a network of MSG Sphere venues would provide the Company with a number of avenues for potential growth, including driving increased bookings and greater marketing and sponsorship opportunities. As we explore selectively extending the MSG Sphere network beyond Las Vegas to other markets around the world, we intend to utilize several options such as non-recourse debt financing, joint ventures, equity partners and a managed venue model.
•Unique approach to marketing and sales. Our Company possesses powerful and attractive assets able to deliver significant exposure for marketing partners who share our vision of creating brand new experiences and innovative opportunities to engage with audiences. We also benefit from being part of a broader offering including our agreement with MSG Sports, through which the Company offers an integrated approach to marketing partnerships and corporate hospitality solutions to drive sponsorship, signage and suite sales.
◦Delivering unrivaled exposure for our partners. Our assets are highly sought after by companies that value the popularity of our venues, entertainment brands and media properties. These include The Garden — The World’s Most Famous Arena, Radio City Music Hall’s cherished holiday tradition, the Christmas Spectacular production, and MSG Network and MSG+, two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks. Utilizing these powerful platforms, we collaborate with companies to create elevated experiences that showcase their brands in meaningful ways. With the debut of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, we expect the value proposition for partners to continue to expand, as the venue will introduce a new platform with innovative opportunities for them to connect with our guests. For example, the Exosphere at MSG Sphere at The Venetian will be covered in 580,000 square feet of fully programmable LED paneling, creating the world’s largest LED screen and an impactful digital showcase for brands, events and partners.
◦The attractiveness of our assets is further strengthened by various agreements that enable our Company to deliver compelling, broad-based marketing platforms by combining our live entertainment and media assets with MSG Sports’ professional sports brands. We utilize this integrated approach to deliver unrivaled exposure in the New York area for a wide range of companies from both established and emerging industries such as mobile sports gaming, which was legalized in New York in Fiscal Year 2022. As a result, we’ve 
attracted world-class partners that include JPMorgan Chase, Anheuser-Busch, BetMGM, Caesars Sportsbook, Delta Air Lines, DraftKings, Infosys, Lexus and PepsiCo, among others.
◦The Company also offers a wide array of premium corporate hospitality offerings that cater to a variety of audiences. For example, The Garden has a range of suite and club products, including 21 Event Level suites, 58 Lexus Level suites, 18 Infosys Level suites, the Caesars Sportsbook Lounge (formerly the Madison Club), Suite Sixteen and The Loft. These suites and clubs — which provide exclusive private spaces, first-class amenities and some of the best seats in The Garden — are primarily licensed to corporate customers with the majority being multi-year agreements, most of which have annual escalators. We believe the unique combination of our entertainment offerings and MSG Sports’ premium live sporting events, along with the continued importance of corporate hospitality to our guests, position us well to continue to grow this business. And as the Company’s expansion plans progress, our MSG Sphere venues will deliver additional hospitality options in other major markets.
◦Understanding our customers. We continue to forge deep direct-to-consumer relationships with customers and fans, with a focus on understanding how consumers interact with every aspect of the Company. A key component of this strategy is our large and growing proprietary database of millions of customers. Our ability to aggregate data across linear networks, venues and digital products provides the Company with significant insights into our viewers and consumers, including who is consuming our content, utilizing our apps, visiting our websites and attending our venues. In addition to providing value for our marketing partners, these insights can be leveraged to help drive revenue and engagement across our assets, providing us with an opportunity to tailor offerings and cross-promote our products and services, introducing customers to our wide range of assets and brands.
•A growing portfolio of proprietary venue content. We continue to explore the creation of proprietary venue content — including the development of attraction-like shows for MSG Sphere — that enables us to benefit from being both content creator and venue operator. Content development will ultimately give us greater control over the utilization of our venues, making us less reliant on touring schedules. The Company is supporting this strategy through MSG Sphere Studios, a creative studio headquartered in Burbank, CA that brings together expertise from across the entertainment industry. Established in 2020, MSG Sphere Studios features an interdisciplinary team of creative, production, technology and software experts providing full in-house creative and production services — including strategy and concept, capture, show production and postproduction.
◦At MSG Sphere Studios, the Company is also working together with artists, directors, and brands to develop and test content for MSG Sphere, enabling them to seamlessly utilize MSG Sphere’s capabilities to bring their creative vision to life. MSG Sphere Studios features proprietary tools developed specifically for MSG Sphere that makes content creation for this powerful platform a seamless experience and maximizes the potential of MSG Sphere’s immersive technologies — whether adapting existing content or developing original attractions purpose-built for MSG Sphere at The Venetian. 
•A continued commitment to innovation in media. For more than 50 years, MSG Networks has been at the forefront of the industry, pushing the boundaries of regional sports coverage. We continually seek to enhance the value that our networks provide to viewers, advertisers and distributors by utilizing state-of-the-art technology to deliver high-quality, best-in-class content and live viewing experiences. MSG Networks has experimented with new types of content including alternative versions of live game telecasts and sports gaming-focused studio programming. It is now positioned as one of the premium destinations for sports gaming content after launching three new sports gaming shows in Fiscal Year 2022. MSG Networks continues to evaluate new ways to monetize its media rights and content library through potential new and complimentary product offerings, such as a potential direct-to-consumer offering. 
•Utilizing our world-class hospitality expertise. The Company owns a controlling interest in Tao Group Hospitality — a leader in the global hospitality industry. Tao Group Hospitality operates over 70 entertainment dining and nightlife branded locations within 60 venues in over 20 markets across five continents. It features a collection of widely recognized brands, including: Tao, Marquee, Lavo, Beauty & Essex, Cathédrale, Hakkasan and Omnia. Tao Group Hospitality has been expanding in select markets both domestically and internationally, and with the acquisition of the business of Hakkasan USA, Inc. (“Hakkasan”) in April 2021, increased its domestic reach in markets such as Las Vegas, Hawaii, Southern California and Miami, while also significantly growing its international presence with the addition of important global destinations such as London and the Middle East. Its most recent new location, Fleur Room, opened in Los Angeles subsequent to the end of Fiscal Year 2022. In addition to its expansion plans, Tao Group Hospitality has become a valuable strategic partner for the Company. This includes at The Garden, where Tao Group Hospitality is playing a larger role in the food and hospitality offerings, as well as in Las Vegas, where its 17-
year history in the market will help to create a world-class guest experience for MSG Sphere.
Our Business
Entertainment
Our Company delivers unforgettable live experiences — all in extraordinary settings located in some of the country’s most important entertainment markets. This creates a significant demand for an association with our brands by a wide selection of artists, sporting events, premier companies and the public. And with a foundation of iconic venues, our Company has a proven ability to leverage the strength of our industry relationships, marketing assets, customer database and live event expertise to create compelling performance, promotion and distribution opportunities for artists, events and productions.
Specifically, through our Entertainment segment, the Company produces, presents and hosts a variety of live entertainment events, such as concerts, sporting events, family shows, performing arts events, special events and wholly-owned productions. In addition, the Company hosts two of the most recognized franchises in professional sports — the NBA’s Knicks and the NHL’s Rangers. These live events are held at the Company’s venues, The Garden, Hulu Theater, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, and The Chicago Theatre. With seating capacities and configurations that range from 2,800 to 21,000, our diverse collection of venues enables us to showcase a multitude of acts and events that cover a wide spectrum of genres to diverse audiences. The Company is also expanding its portfolio of venues with the construction of MSG Sphere at The Venetian in Las Vegas.
Our productions include the beloved holiday show, the Christmas Spectacular — which runs exclusively at Radio City Music Hall and features the world-famous Radio City Rockettes (the “Rockettes”).
In addition, our Entertainment segment includes our controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival.
Our Bookings Business
Live Entertainment
Our Company is an established industry leader that books a wide variety of live entertainment events in our venues, which perennially include some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. Over the last several years, our venues have been key destinations for artists such as the Eagles, U2, Foo Fighters, Paul McCartney, Drake, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, Harry Styles, Dead and Company, Phish, Fleetwood Mac, Kacey Musgraves, Eric Clapton, Josh Groban, Andrea Boccelli, Jennifer Lopez, Carrie Underwood, Justin Timberlake, P!nk, Chris Stapleton, Radiohead, Barbra Streisand, Olivia Rodrigo, Ariana Grande, Sebastian Maniscalco, Trevor Noah, John Mulaney and Dave Chappelle.
In addition, we have successfully developed new ways to increase the utilization of our venues, while creating unique experiences for artists and fans with our various residencies — including The Garden’s first music franchise: Billy Joel at The Garden. This extraordinary residency is at a historic 81 performances and counting since it began in January 2014, bringing Billy Joel’s lifetime performances at The World’s Most Famous Arena to 127 (through July 2022). The Company’s other current residencies include the multi-year, dual-city residency of Tedeschi Trucks Band at both the Beacon Theatre and The Chicago Theatre. The Company has also in recent years successfully created other unique bookings and residencies across its portfolio of venues, including Jerry Seinfeld at the Beacon Theatre, Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall, Phish’s 13-night “Baker’s Dozen” run at The Garden, Ali Wong at the Beacon Theatre, Trey Anastasio’s eight-week virtual residency at the Beacon Theatre — a first for the Company — and Josh Groban’s “Great Big Radio City Show.”
Our venues also attract family shows and theatrical productions, which have included: ’Twas the Night Before… by Cirque du Soleil at both The Chicago Theatre and Hulu Theater, as well as Peppa Pig Live!, Paw Patrol Live! and Sesame Street Live!. Other significant events that have taken place at our venues include the Tony Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, New York Comic Con, Tribeca Festival events and the final season premieres of both HBO’s Game of Thrones and STARZ’s POWER. We have also hosted appearances by luminaries such as His Holiness Pope Francis, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, along with graduations, television upfronts, product launches and film premieres. 
Although we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows. If we serve as promoters or co-promoters of a show, we have economic risk relating to the event. 
Sports
MSG Sports’ professional sports teams, the Knicks and Rangers, are two of the most recognized franchises in sports, with passionate, multi-generational fanbases. The Company has long-term Arena License Agreements with MSG Sports that require 
the Knicks and the Rangers to play their home games at The Garden, allowing us to continue hosting their long-time fans at The World’s Most Famous Arena.
Our Company also promotes, produces and/or presents a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, esports and wrestling. Many of these events are among the most popular in our history and are perennial highlights on our annual calendar, as well as some of The Garden’s longest-running associations.
Professional boxing has had a long history with The Garden. The Garden famously hosted Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier’s 1971 “Fight of the Century,” considered among the greatest sporting events in modern history, as well as numerous other boxing greats, including: Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Willie Pep, Emile Griffith, George Foreman, Roberto Duran, Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, Jr., Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Miguel Cotto and Wladimir Klitschko. In recent years, boxing’s top fighters have called The Garden home, including former unified lightweight world champion Teofimo Lopez, former three weight class champion Vasyl Lomachenko and super middleweight Edgar Berlanga. In 2022, for the first-time in The Garden’s history, two women headlined a boxing event when Katie Taylor faced off against Amanda Serrano in front of a sold-out crowd for the undisputed lightweight championship.
Since the return of professional mixed martial arts in New York State in 2016, The Garden regularly hosts top UFC events, as well as Bellator MMA events and the Professional Fighters League, which has held events at Hulu Theater, including its inaugural World Championships.
College sports have been a mainstay at The Garden for decades, with college basketball being featured at The World’s Most Famous Arena for nearly 90 years. The Garden hosted the annual Big East Tournament in March 2022 for the 40th straight year. It is the longest-running conference tournament at one site in all of college basketball and will celebrate its 41st anniversary at The Garden in March 2023. In addition, St. John’s University has called The Garden its “home away from home” for decades. The Garden also continues to build its college hockey tradition, with a popular biennial event featuring Cornell University vs. Boston University, as well as recent visits from top national teams such as Boston College, North Dakota, Harvard, Yale, Michigan and Minnesota.
For the first time in venue history, the Madison Square Garden Complex hosted professional darts when the US Darts Masters and the North American Championship took place at Hulu Theater in 2022, which also marked the first time a professional darts championship was held in New York City.
Other world-class sporting events have included the NBA All-Star Game in 2015, and the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball East Regional Finals, which The Garden hosted in 2014 and 2017. The widely popular season-ending tournament is set to return to The Garden in 2023.
Our Productions 
One of the Company’s core properties, the Christmas Spectacular — which runs exclusively at Radio City Music Hall and features the world-famous Rockettes — has been performed at the Music Hall since 1933. This production has become a tradition for many, creating a holiday touchstone that generations of fans want to return to, time and again. The show’s enduring popularity is driven by the incomparable Radio City Rockettes, the longest-running precision dance company in America, admired for their iconic style of dance, talent and athleticism, as well as their unity both on and off the stage.
In 2021, the production returned for a shortened run — a result of the COVID-19 pandemic — welcoming over 400,000 guests across 101 performances and serving as a source of joy and inspiration for many fans.
With the return of the beloved lyrical number “Snow” in 2021, the Rockettes now perform in nine numbers throughout the 90-minute production — with more technically complex and different styles of dance than ever before.
We acquired the rights to the Christmas Spectacular in 1997, and those rights are separate from, and do not depend on the continuation of, our lease of Radio City Music Hall. We also hold rights to the Rockettes brand in the same manner. We lease Radio City Music Hall pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. See “ — Our Performance Venues — Radio City Music Hall.”
The Company believes it has a significant and unique asset in the Rockettes and continues to strengthen and broaden the Rockettes brand by targeting the most prominent and effective vehicles that elevate their visibility and underscore their reputation as beloved American cultural icons. The Rockettes have appeared or performed at high-profile events and award shows, including Presidential Inaugurations, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Macy’s 4th of July Fireworks event, the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting, New Year’s Eve Times Square Ball Drop, Tony Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, World Pride events, and television shows and holiday specials (America’s Got Talent, Project Runway, The Kacey Musgraves 
Christmas Show, The Today Show, Live with Kelly and Ryan and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon), among many others. 
We continue to pursue opportunities to generate greater brand awareness, including through television and public appearances and dance education offerings. We are also committed to ensuring that the best dancers from all backgrounds, cultures, races, religions and ethnicities can become Rockettes, and are actively strengthening our relationships within the dance community, expanding where we hold auditions and scouting sessions, and eliminating financial barriers to entry, including for Rockettes Conservatory, our dancer development program. Rockettes Conservatory is an invite-only, week-long intensive training program held at Radio City Music Hall and offered at no cost to participants. The program was designed as an investment in promising dancers’ futures, and in addition to becoming an inclusive talent pipeline for future Rockettes, conservatory ensures the dance company continues to evolve by attracting the best dancers. Additionally, to create a more inclusive line by broadening the number of dancers eligible to become Rockettes, the organization announced an expanded height requirement beginning with the April 2022 audition.
Our Festival Offering
The Company owns a controlling interest in BCE, the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England’s premier music festival — Boston Calling, which celebrated its 11th edition in 2022 after canceling its 2020 and 2021 festivals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-day festival takes place over Memorial Day weekend at the Harvard Athletic Complex and features performances from marquee headliners along with a diverse array of musicians, bands and local performers. The festival also showcases a variety of food and drink offerings featuring the best of Boston’s restaurants, world-famous breweries and award-winning chefs.
Our Performance Venues 
The Company operates a mix of iconic performance venues that continue to build on their historic prominence as destinations for unforgettable experiences and events.
We own or operate under long-term leases a total of five venues in New York City and Chicago. These venues are: The Garden, Hulu Theater, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in New York City; and The Chicago Theatre. The Company is also building a new venue in Las Vegas, MSG Sphere at The Venetian and, in 2018, we purchased land in Stratford, London which we expect will become home to a future MSG Sphere.
The Garden
The Garden has been a celebrated center of New York life since it first opened its doors in 1879. Over its 143-year history, there have been four Garden buildings, each known for showcasing the best of the era’s live sports and entertainment offerings. We believe that The Garden has come to epitomize the power and passion of live sports and entertainment to people around the world, with an appearance at The Garden often representing a pinnacle of an athlete’s or performer’s career. Known as “The World’s Most Famous Arena,” The Garden has been the site of some of the most memorable events in sports and entertainment, and together with Hulu Theater, has hosted hundreds of events and millions of visitors each year. In 2009, Billboard magazine ranked The Garden the number-one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Music industry subscribers to the trade magazine Pollstar have voted The Garden “Arena of the Year” 23 times since the inception of the awards in 1989. The Garden also regularly ranks as the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world based on Billboard magazine’s mid-year and year-end rankings. The venue was ranked number one worldwide four times in the last five years for venues with a capacity over 15,001, according to Billboard’s year-end rankings.
Over The Garden’s history, it has been the setting for countless “big events,” inspired performances and one-of-a-kind moments that have helped define sports, entertainment and culture. Highlights include “The Fight of the Century” between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971, the 1970 Knicks’ NBA Championship, the Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup Championship, three Democratic National Conventions and one Republican National Convention, Marilyn Monroe’s famous birthday serenade to President John F. Kennedy, Frank Sinatra’s “Main Event” concert in 1974, the only U.S. concerts from the reunited Cream, the 25th Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts, the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, and Billy Joel’s record-breaking 127 total performances at The Garden (through July 2022). In September 2015, His Holiness Pope Francis celebrated Mass at The Garden as part of his successful U.S. visit, which marked the first time a current pope has visited The Garden since Pope John Paul II in 1979. The Garden has also hosted four prominent benefit concerts, which galvanized the public to respond to national and global crises, including the first of its kind, “The Concert for Bangladesh” in 1972, as well as “The Concert for New York City,” following the events of 9/11, “From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,” held after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and “12-12-12, The Concert for Sandy Relief” in 2012. And in February 2020, To Kill a Mockingbird became the first-ever 
Broadway play to perform at The Garden with an entirely free performance for 18,000 New York City public school students. The Garden also continues to be home to two of MSG Sports’ professional sports franchises — the Knicks and Rangers.
The current Madison Square Garden Complex, located between 31st and 33rd Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues on Manhattan’s West Side, opened on February 11, 1968 with a salute to the United Service Organizations hosted by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. From a structural standpoint, the construction of the current Garden was considered an engineering wonder for its time, including its famous circular shape and unique, cable supported ceiling, which contributes to its intimate feel. It was the first large structure built over an active railroad track. The builder, R.E. McKee, had a national reputation and was later recognized as a “Master Builder” by the construction industry. Architect Charles Luckman had one of the largest firms in the country and designed such buildings as the Prudential Tower in Boston, NASA’s flight center in Houston and the Forum in Inglewood, CA.
Following a three-year, top-to-bottom renovation, in October 2013, The Garden was fully transformed, featuring improved sightlines, additional entertainment and dining options, new concourses, upgraded hospitality areas, new technology, unique historic exhibits, and a completely transformed interior, where the intimacy of the arena bowl and The Garden’s world-famous ceiling were maintained. Focused on the total fan experience, the renovation was designed to benefit everyone in attendance, whether first-time visitors, season ticket subscribers, athletes, artists, suite holders or marketing partners. The Garden’s transformation ensured that attending an event at “The World’s Most Famous Arena” remained unlike anywhere else.
We own the Madison Square Garden Complex, the platform on which it is built and development rights (including air rights) above our property. Madison Square Garden sits atop Pennsylvania Station (“Penn Station”), a major commuter hub in Manhattan, which is owned by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). While the development rights we own would permit us to expand in the future, any such use of development rights would require various approvals from the City of New York. The Garden seats up to approximately 21,000 spectators for entertainment and sporting events and, along with Hulu Theater, contains approximately 1,100,000 square feet of floor space over 11 levels.
Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden 
Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, which has approximately 5,600 seats, opened as part of the fourth Madison Square Garden Complex in 1968. Since then, some of the biggest names in live entertainment have performed at Hulu Theater, including The Who, Diana Ross, Elton John, James Taylor, Mary J. Blige, Pentatonix, John Legend, Karol G, Ellie Goulding, Chris Rock, Neil Young, Bill Maher, Jerry Seinfeld, Tyler, the Creator, J Balvin, Ricky Gervais, Nicky Jam, Aziz Ansari, Alejandro Sanz, Bert Kreischer and Van Morrison. Hulu Theater has also been the site for several boxing events including the inaugural World Championships of the Professional Fighters League as well as the NBA and NFL Drafts. In addition, it has hosted various product launches, upfronts, award shows, and other special events such as Wheel of Fortune and audition shows for America’s Got Talent, as well as a variety of theatrical productions and family shows, including ’Twas the Night Before… by Cirque du Soleil, A Christmas Story, Elf The Musical, Paw Patrol Live! and Sesame Street Live!. Our Company has a multi-faceted marketing partnership with Hulu, a leading premium streaming service, that includes exclusive naming rights. Hulu Theater regularly ranks as one of the highest-grossing entertainment venues of its size in the world, based on Billboard magazine’s mid-year and year-end rankings.
Radio City Music Hall
Radio City Music Hall has a rich history as a national theatrical and cultural mecca since it was first built by theatrical impresario S.L. “Roxy” Rothafel in 1932. Known as “The Showplace of the Nation,” it was the first building in the Rockefeller Center complex and, at the time, the largest indoor theater in the world. Radio City Music Hall, a venue with approximately 6,000 seats, hosts concerts, family shows and special events, and is home to the Christmas Spectacular. See “— Our Productions.” Over its history, entertainers who have graced the Great Stage include: Aretha Franklin, Lady Gaga, Brian Wilson, Harry Styles, Diana Ross, Lizzo, Olivia Rodrigo, Josh Groban, Mariah Carey, Lorde, Nine Inch Nails, Trey Anastasio, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Tony Bennett, Hasan Minhaj, Billie Eilish, Sebastian Maniscalco, Jim Gaffigan, David Gilmour and Dave Chappelle. Radio City Music Hall was recognized by Pollstar magazine as Theatre of the Decade for 2009-2019 and regularly ranks as the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard magazine’s mid-year and year-end rankings. The venue has ranked number one worldwide nine of the last ten years for venues with capacities of 5,001 to 10,000, according to Billboard’s year-end rankings.
In 1978, Radio City Music Hall was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. We acquired the lease in 1997, and in 1999, performed a complete restoration that returned the legendary theater to its original grandeur. The acclaimed restoration touched all aspects of the venue, including burnishing the ceilings of Radio City Music Hall with 720,000 sheets of gold and aluminum leaf, replacing the existing stage curtain with a new 112-foot wide golden silk curtain, and cleaning the three-story tall mural “The Fountain of Youth,” by Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase. State-of-the-art sound systems, lighting and HDTV capabilities 
were also installed.
We lease Radio City Music Hall, located at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street in Manhattan, pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. In July 2021, the Company extended the term of the lease, previously set to expire in 2023, until August 31, 2038 with an option to renew for an additional 10 years by providing two years’ notice prior to expiration. 
Beacon Theatre
In November 2006, we entered into a long-term lease agreement to operate the legendary Beacon Theatre, a venue with approximately 2,800 seats, which sits on the corner of Broadway and 74th Street in Manhattan. The Beacon Theatre was conceived by S. L. “Roxy” Rothafel and is considered the “older sister” to Radio City Music Hall. Designed by Chicago architect Walter Ahlschlager, the Beacon Theatre opened in 1929 as a forum for vaudeville acts, musical productions, drama, opera and movies. The Beacon Theatre was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Over its history, the Beacon Theatre has been a venerable rock and roll room for some of the greatest names in music, including: Steely Dan, Coldplay, Alice Cooper, Dave Matthews Band, Crosby Stills & Nash, Elton John, Hozier, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Eddie Vedder, John Mellencamp, Widespread Panic and Bob Dylan, as well as The Allman Brothers Band, which played their 238th show at the Beacon Theatre in October 2014, marking their final concert as a band. In recent years, the venue has become a comedy haven, hosting a monthly Jerry Seinfeld residency and multi-night stands from comedians including Ali Wong, Sebastian Maniscalco, Chelsea Handler, Eddie Izzard, Nate Bargatze and Russell Peters. The venue has also hosted special events, such as film premieres for the Tribeca Festival, along with numerous luminaries such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2009 and 2013, and President Bill Clinton in 2006, when the Rolling Stones played a private concert in honor of his 60th birthday. In Fall 2020, the Company and Trey Anastasio presented The Beacon Jams, the venue’s first-ever virtual residency which included eight weekly shows that were streamed live to hundreds of thousands of fans and raised more than $1 million for charity.
In August 2008, the Beacon Theatre was closed for a seven-month restoration project to return the theater to its original 1929 grandeur. The restoration of the Beacon Theatre focused on all historic, interior public spaces of the building, backstage and back-of-house areas, and was based on extensive historic research, as well as detailed, on-site examination of original, decorative painting techniques that had been covered by decades-old layers of paint. The Beacon Theatre has won several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The widely acclaimed, comprehensive restoration was similar to our restoration of Radio City Music Hall and reflects our commitment to New York City. The Beacon Theatre regularly ranks as one of the highest-grossing entertainment venues of its size in the world, based on Billboard magazine’s mid-year and year-end rankings.
In December 2021, the Company extended the term of our lease on the Beacon Theatre, previously set to expire in 2026, until December 31, 2036 with an option to renew for an additional 10 years by providing notice prior to expiration.
The Chicago Theatre
In October 2007, to provide us with an anchor for content and distribution in a key market in the Midwest, we purchased the legendary The Chicago Theatre, a venue with approximately 3,600 seats. The Chicago Theatre, which features its famous six-story-high “C-H-I-C-A-G-O” marquee, was built in 1921 and designed in the French Baroque style by architects Cornelius W. Rapp and George L. Rapp. It is the oldest surviving example of this architectural style in Chicago today, and was designated a Chicago landmark building in 1983.
The Chicago Theatre has become a highly attractive destination for concerts, comedy shows and other live events, hosting a wide range of entertainers, including Bob Dylan, Mumford & Sons, David Byrne, Neil Young, Diana Ross, Madonna, Jerry Seinfeld, Janet Jackson, Elvis Costello, Bob Weir, Jim Gaffigan, Conan O’Brien, Amy Schumer, Steely Dan and Brett Eldredge. The venue has also hosted theatrical tours such as ’Twas the Night Before… by Cirque du Soleil, A Christmas Story, The Wizard of Oz, Paw Patrol Live! and Dr. Seuss’ How The Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical. The Chicago Theatre regularly ranks as one of the highest-grossing entertainment venues of its size in the world, based on Billboard magazine’s mid-year and year-end rankings.
MSG Sphere 
The Company is progressing with its creation of MSG Sphere at The Venetian, adjacent to the Strip in Las Vegas, which will utilize cutting-edge technologies to create immersive experiences on an unprecedented scale. MSG Sphere is an entirely new medium, uniquely built for immersive entertainment experiences, and key design features include:
•A 580,000 square foot, fully-programmable LED Exosphere - the world’s largest LED screen;
•An interior bowl featuring the highest resolution LED screen known today — with more than 160,000 square feet of immersive display surface — larger than three football fields; 
•An advanced acoustics system featuring more than 160,000 speakers and beamforming technology that will deliver crystal clear audio and provide unique directional listening experiences; 
•Multi-sensory technologies, including an immersive seating system that uses deep vibrations so guests can “feel” the experience, as well as environmental effects such as temperature and scent; and 
•An advanced architecture for connectivity that will enable a broader range of content, greater interaction among guests and more immersive entertainment experiences.
These technologies will come together to create a powerful platform, which we believe will make MSG Sphere the venue of choice for a wide variety of content — including original immersive attractions, concerts, residencies, and corporate and marquee events.
The Company is building its first MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, a 17,500-seat venue, on land adjacent to The Venetian Resort leased from a subsidiary of Venetian Las Vegas Gaming, LLC (“The Venetian”). The Venetian agreed to provide us with $75 million to help fund the construction costs, including the cost of a pedestrian bridge that links MSG Sphere to The Venetian Expo. Through June 30, 2022, The Venetian paid us $65 million of this amount for construction costs. The ground lease has no fixed rent; however, if certain return objectives are achieved, The Venetian will receive 25% of the after-tax cash flow in excess of such objectives. The lease is for a term of 50 years, commencing upon substantial completion of construction.
For this project, the Company began serving as construction manager in December 2020, providing it with significant transparency and control over the construction process, including direct engagement and supervision of subcontractors. 
MSG Sphere at The Venetian is a complex construction project with cutting-edge technology, which relies on subcontractors obtaining components from a variety of sources around the world. In April 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending construction of MSG Sphere due to COVID-19 related factors that were outside of its control, including supply chain issues. As the ongoing effects of the pandemic continued to impact its business operations, in August 2020, the Company disclosed that it had resumed full construction with a lengthened timetable to better preserve cash through the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to make significant progress on construction, and expects to open the venue in the second half of calendar year 2023. See “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — General Risk Factors — Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and May in the Future be, Materially Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response by Governmental Authorities and Certain Professional Sports Leagues.”
Because of the transformative nature of these venues, we believe there could be other markets — both domestic and international — where MSG Sphere can be successful. The design of MSG Sphere will be flexible to accommodate a wide range of sizes and capacities — from large-scale to smaller and more intimate — based on the needs of any individual market. 
As we explore selectively extending the MSG Sphere network beyond Las Vegas to other markets around the world, the Company’s intention is to utilize several options, such as non-recourse debt financing, joint ventures, equity partners and a managed venue model. 
In February 2018, we announced the purchase of land in Stratford, London, which we expect will become home to a future MSG Sphere. The Company submitted a planning application to the local planning authority in March 2019 and that process, which requires various stages of review to be completed and approvals to be granted, is ongoing. Therefore, we do not have a definitive timeline at this time.
See “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MSG Spheres.”
MSG Networks 
MSG Networks, which the Company acquired in July 2021, is an industry leader in sports production, content development and distribution. It includes two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network and MSG+, a companion streaming service, MSG GO, and other digital properties. 
Debuting as the first regional sports network in the country on October 15, 1969, MSG Networks has been a pioneer in regional sports programming for more than 50 years, setting a standard of excellence, creativity and technological innovation. Today, MSG Networks’ exclusive, award-winning programming continues to be a valuable differentiator for viewers, advertisers and the cable, satellite, fiber-optic and other platforms (“Distributors”) that distribute its networks. MSG Networks is widely 
distributed throughout all of New York State and significant portions of New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as parts of Pennsylvania. MSG GO allows subscribers to access MSG Network and MSG+ and on demand content from a subscriber’s geographic region on their smartphones, tablets, and computers and is currently available to subscribers of all MSG Networks major distributors. MSG Networks is also carried nationally by certain Distributors on sports tiers or in similar packages.
Throughout its history, MSG Networks has been at the forefront of the industry, pushing the boundaries of regional sports coverage. In the process, its networks have become a powerful platform for some of the world’s greatest athletes and entertainers. MSG Networks’ commitment to programming excellence has earned it a reputation for best-in-class programming, production, marketing, and technical innovation. It has won more New York Emmy Awards for live sports and original programming over the past 10 years than any other regional sports network in the region.
The foundation of MSG Networks’ programming is its professional sports coverage. MSG Network and MSG+ feature a wide range of compelling sports content, including exclusive live local games and other programming of the Knicks, Rangers, Islanders, Devils and Sabres, as well as significant coverage of the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. MSG Networks also showcases a wide array of other sports and entertainment programming, which includes Westchester Knicks basketball, New York Riptide lacrosse, as well as horse racing, soccer, poker, tennis, mixed martial arts and boxing programs.
MSG Network and MSG+ collectively air hundreds of live professional games each year, along with a comprehensive lineup of other sporting events and original programming designed to give fans behind-the-scenes access and insight into the teams and players they love. This content includes pre- and post-game coverage throughout the seasons, along with team-related programming that features coaches, players and more, all of which capitalizes on the enthusiasm for the teams featured on MSG Network and MSG+. 
MSG Networks is also positioned as one of the premium destinations for sports gaming content. In Fiscal Year 2022, MSG Networks debuted three new sports gaming shows prior to the legalization of mobile sports gaming in New York — The Bettor Half Hour, The Betting Exchange, and Odds with Ends. Each show features a mix of sports gaming experts and former New York athletes delivering sports gaming content in a fun and informative way.
Tao Group Hospitality
Tao Group Hospitality develops, owns and operates many of the most successful entertainment dining and nightlife venues in the world. Since opening its first venue in 2000, Tao Group Hospitality has been creating some of the hospitality industry’s most innovative experiences. In April 2021, Tao Group Hospitality acquired Hakkasan, creating a global leader in premium hospitality. Following the acquisition, the Company has an approximately 67% indirect controlling interest in the combined business.
Tao Group Hospitality’s portfolio features over 70 branded locations within 60 venues (a single venue may have multiple branded locations on-site) in over 20 markets across five continents – with a collection of world-renowned brands, including: Tao, Marquee, Lavo, Beauty & Essex, Cathédrale, Hakkasan and Omnia.

Through a combination of license, management and lease agreements, Tao Group Hospitality has a vast network of partners that provide the company with additional opportunities for expansion and brand development both domestically and internationally.
Tao Group Hospitality is continuing to actively develop opportunities to expand in select markets both domestically and internationally. In Fiscal Year 2022, Tao Group Hospitality opened two brand new locations, Ling Ling Mexico City as well as Lavo Ristorante in Los Angeles, and subsequent to the end of Fiscal Year 2022, Tao Group Hospitality opened Fleur Room in Los Angeles. Tao Group Hospitality has a pipeline of new branded locations planned for Fiscal Year 2023, including a waterfront restaurant in Miami.
The Company employs Tao Group Hospitality’s expertise to create new and innovative premium hospitality experiences that can be integrated across the Entertainment segment’s live offerings, driving value and growth across the Company. This includes at The Garden, where Tao Group Hospitality is playing an increasingly larger role in the food and hospitality offerings. In addition, Tao Group Hospitality operates, in partnership with the Company, Suite Sixteen at The Garden — a members-only suite that combines Tao-style luxury with top sports and entertainment events to deliver a unique premium experience for fans. Tao Group Hospitality is also a strategic partner with the Company in Las Vegas, where it is helping to create a world-class guest experience for MSG Sphere at The Venetian. Tao Group Hospitality has a 17-year history in the Las Vegas market, where — with the acquisition of Hakkasan — it now has 14 branded locations.
Intellectual Property
We create, own and license intellectual property in the countries in which we operate, have operated or intend to operate, and it is our practice to protect our trademarks, brands, copyrights, inventions and other original and acquired works. We have registered many of our trademarks and have filed applications for certain others. Additionally, we have filed for patent protection in the United States and other countries where we operate or plan to operate. Our registrations and applications relate to trademarks and inventions associated with, among other of our brands, Madison Square Garden, the Radio City Rockettes, MSG Sphere and Tao Group Hospitality brands. We believe our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights, including the technology and content being developed for MSG Sphere and our brand logos, are important to our business, our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our products and services. We cannot predict, however, whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or protect against vulnerability to oppositions or cancellation actions due to non-use. See “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property — We May Become Subject to Infringement or Other Claims Relating to Our Content or Technology” and “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property — Theft of Our Intellectual Property May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Other Investments
Our Company explores investment opportunities that strengthen its existing position within the entertainment landscape and/or allow us to exploit our assets and core competencies for growth.
In July 2018, the Company acquired a 30% interest in SACO Technologies Inc. (“SACO”), a global provider of high-performance LED video lighting and media solutions. The Company is utilizing SACO as a preferred display technology provider for MSG Sphere and is benefiting from agreed-upon commercial terms. In addition, the Company also has other investments in various entertainment, hospitality companies and related technology companies, accounted for under the equity method. 
Our Community
The Company actively engages with and supports the communities we serve through a variety of important initiatives.
We are proud to play a leadership role organizing extraordinary events such as opening The Garden to the “12-12-12” benefit concert organized post-Superstorm Sandy, which raised more than $50 million for hurricane victims. In February 2020, The Garden opened its doors to 18,000 New York City public school students for an exclusive, free performance of the Broadway production of To Kill a Mockingbird. In addition to these events, the Company provides funding annually to various non-profit organizations across the country, as well as in-kind contributions such as tickets, promotional items and food to schools, charities and community-based organizations in the local area. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company worked with dozens of local restaurants and charities to donate approximately 200,000 meals to families in need. In addition, the Company is a long-time supporter of the Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research, the nation’s largest private supporter of pancreatic cancer research, which has directed more than $225 million to research and assembled the best scientific minds to help find a cure. 
Our Company also has a close association with The Garden of Dreams Foundation (the “Foundation”), a non-profit charity dedicated to bringing life changing opportunities to young people in need. In partnership with the Company and MSG Sports, the Foundation provides young people in our communities with access to educational and skills opportunities, mentoring programs, and memorable experiences that enhance their lives, help shape their futures and create lasting joy. Specific initiatives include the Inspire Scholarship program, which has committed since its inception over $5.8 million in aid to high school seniors to provide financial assistance related to college and trade school expenses, and “MSG Classroom,” an Emmy award-winning educational initiative that teaches high school students about the media industry through hands-on learning opportunities in areas such as broadcasting, script writing and production. All of the Foundation’s activities target young people facing illness or financial challenges, as well as children of uniformed personnel who have been lost or injured while serving our communities. Since its inception in 2006, the Foundation has impacted more than 400,000 young people and their families.
Regulation 
The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our business are subject to change. The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements that are most significant to our business today; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our business.
Our Entertainment and Tao Group Hospitality businesses are subject to the general powers of federal, state and local government, as well as foreign governmental authorities, to deal with matters of health and public safety.
Venue Licenses
Our venues, like all public spaces, are subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which they are located. Our venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations, and, with respect to Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre and The Chicago Theatre, landmark regulations which restrict us from making certain modifications to our facilities as of right or from operating certain types of businesses. Our venues also require a number of licenses to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses and other authorizations and, with respect to The Garden, a zoning special permit granted by the New York City Planning Commission. In the jurisdictions in which these venues are located, the operator is subject to statutes that generally provide that serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated or minor guest is a violation of the law and may provide for strict liability for certain damages arising out of such violations. In addition, our venues are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (and related state and local statutes), which requires us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of our facilities. We and our venues are also subject to environmental laws and regulations. See “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — Economic and Operational Risks — We Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Our Failure to Comply with These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Labor
Our Entertainment and Tao Group Hospitality businesses are also subject to regulation regarding working conditions, overtime and minimum wage requirements. See “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — Economic and Operational Risks — Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.”
Ticket Sales
Our Entertainment business is subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally.
Data and Privacy
We are subject to data privacy and protection laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, processing and use of personal information or personal data, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy and security of personal information. The variety of laws and regulations governing data privacy and protection, and the use of the internet as a commercial medium are rapidly evolving, extensive and complex, and may include provisions and obligations that are inconsistent with one another or uncertain in their scope or application. 
The data protection landscape is rapidly evolving in the United States. For example, California passed a comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), and other states including Virginia and Colorado have also passed similar laws. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights procedures and obligations, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and constraints on certain uses of sensitive data. The majority of the CPRA provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. Further, there are several legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new privacy and security obligations. 
In addition, governmental authorities and private litigants continue to bring actions against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that are unfair or deceptive. 
International Operations
Our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, as well as international bodies, such as the European Union. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to, among other things, foreign privacy and data protection, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, currency and repatriation of funds, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws and regulations apply to the activities of the Company and, in some cases, to individual directors, officers and employees of the Company and agents acting on our behalf. Certain of these laws impose stringent requirements on how we can conduct our foreign operations and could place restrictions on our business and partnering activities.
FCC Regulations
Our MSG Networks business is also subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”). The FCC imposes regulations directly on programming networks and also on certain Distributors that affect programming networks indirectly. 
Closed Captioning
Our programming networks must provide closed captioning of video programming for the hearing impaired and meet certain captioning quality standards. The FCC and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards. We are also required to provide closed captioning on certain video content delivered via the Internet.
Commercial Loudness
FCC rules require multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) to ensure that all commercials comply with specified volume standards, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Advertising Restrictions on Children’s Programming
Any programming intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under and associated Internet websites that we may offer must comply with certain limits on commercial matter and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to certify compliance with such standards.
Obscenity Restrictions
Distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene programming, and certain of our affiliation agreements require us to refrain from including such programming on our networks.
Program Carriage
The FCC has made changes to the program carriage rules, which prohibit Distributors from favoring their affiliated programming networks over unaffiliated similarly situated programming networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between programming networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Some of these recent changes to the rules could make it more difficult for our programming networks to challenge a Distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our programming networks or to discriminate against one of our programming networks.
Packaging and Pricing
The FCC periodically considers examining whether to adopt rules regulating how programmers package and price their networks, such as whether programming networks require Distributors to purchase and carry undesired programming in return for the right to carry desired programming and, if so, whether such arrangements should be prohibited.
Effect of “Must-Carry” and Retransmission Consent Requirements
The FCC’s implementation of the statutory “must-carry” obligations requires cable and satellite Distributors to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space, and the implementation of “retransmission consent” requirements allow broadcasters to extract compensation, whether monetary or mandated carriage of affiliated content, in return for permission to carry their networks. These rules may reduce the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our programming networks and the amount of funds that Distributors have to pay us for our networks.
Website and Mobile Application Requirements
Our Entertainment and MSG Networks businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet websites and mobile applications. We maintain various websites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our business, offer merchandise and tickets for sale, make available sweepstakes and/or contests and offer hospitality services. The operation of these websites and applications may be subject to third-party application store requirements, as well as a range of federal, state and local laws including those related to privacy and protection of personal information, accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our websites seek to collect information from children under 13 years of age, they may be subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which places restrictions on websites’ and online services’ collection and use of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent. 
Competition
Competition in Our Entertainment Business
Our Entertainment business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, with other live performances, sporting events, movies, home entertainment (including the Internet and online services, social media and social networking platforms, television, video and gaming devices), and the large number of other entertainment and public attraction options available to members of the public. Our Entertainment businesses typically represent alternative uses for the public’s entertainment dollars. The primary geographic area in which we operate, New York City, is among the most competitive entertainment markets in the world, with the world’s largest live theater industry and extensive performing arts venues, 12 major professional sports teams, numerous museums, galleries and other attractions, and numerous movie theaters available to the public. We also expect to have significant operations in Las Vegas. Our venues and live offerings outside of New York City similarly compete with other entertainment options in their respective markets and elsewhere. We compete with these other entertainment options on the basis of the quality of our offerings, the public’s interest in our content and the price of our tickets.
We compete for bookings with a large number of other venues both in the cities in which our venues are located and in alternative locations capable of booking the same productions and events. Generally, we compete for bookings on the basis of the size, quality, expense and nature of the venue required for the booking. Some of our competitors may have a larger network of venues and/or greater financial resources.
In addition to competition for bookings and ticket sales, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and sporting events for advertising and sponsorship dollars.
Competition in Our MSG Networks Business
Distribution of Programming Networks
The business of distributing programming networks is highly competitive. Our programming networks face competition from other programming networks, including other regional sports and entertainment networks, for the right to be carried by a particular Distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier(s) that will attract the most subscribers. Once a programming network of ours is carried by a Distributor, that network competes for viewers not only with the other programming networks available through the Distributor, but also with pay-per-view programming and video on demand offerings, as well as Internet and online streaming and on demand services, mobile applications, social media and social networking platforms, radio, print media, motion picture theaters, home video, and other sources of information, sporting events and entertainment. Each of the following competitive factors is important to our networks: the prices we charge for our programming networks, the variety, quantity and quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control), of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Our ability to successfully compete with other programming networks for distribution may be hampered because the Distributors may be affiliated with other programming networks. In addition, because such affiliated Distributors may have a substantial number of subscribers, the ability of such competing programming networks to obtain distribution on affiliated Distributors may lead to increased subscriber and advertising revenue for such networks because of their increased penetration compared to our programming networks. Even if such affiliated Distributors carry our programming networks, there is no assurance that such Distributors will not place their affiliated programming network on more desirable tier(s) or otherwise favor their affiliated programming network, thereby giving the affiliated programming network a competitive advantage over our own.
New or existing programming networks that are owned by or affiliated with broadcast networks such as NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox, or broadcast station owners, such as Sinclair, may have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the “bundling” of agreements to carry those programming networks with the agreement giving the Distributor the right to carry a broadcast station owned by or affiliated with the network.
In addition, content providers (such as certain broadcast and cable networks) and new content developers, Distributors and syndicators are distributing programming directly to consumers on an “over-the-top” (“OTT”) basis. In addition to existing direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock, additional services have launched and more will likely launch in the near term, which may include sports-focused services that may compete with our networks for viewers and advertising revenue. Such direct-to-consumer OTT distribution of content has contributed to consumers eliminating or downgrading their pay television subscription, which results in certain consumers not receiving our programming networks.

Risks Related to Our MSG Networks Business — We May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms and to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting From Emerging Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.” See also “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Overview — Merger with MSG Networks Inc.”
Sources of Programming
We also compete with other networks and other distribution outlets to secure desired programming, including sports-related programming. Competition for programming increases as the number of programming networks and distribution outlets, including, but not limited to, streaming outlets, increases. Other programming networks, or distribution outlets, that are affiliated with or otherwise have larger relationships with programming sources such as sports teams or leagues, movie or television studios, or film libraries may have a competitive advantage over us in this area.
Competition for Sports Programming Sources
Because the loyalty of the sports viewing audience to a sports programming network is primarily driven by loyalty to a particular team or teams, access to adequate sources of sports programming is particularly critical to our networks. In connection with the spinoff of MSG Sports from MSG Networks in September 2015 (the “2015 Sports Distribution”), MSG Networks entered into long-term media rights agreements with the Knicks and Rangers providing MSG Networks with the exclusive live local media rights to their games. MSG Networks also has multi-year media rights agreements with the Islanders, Devils and Sabres. Our rights with respect to these professional teams may be limited in certain circumstances due to rules imposed by the leagues in which they compete. Our programming networks compete for telecast rights for teams or events principally with national or regional programming networks that specialize in, or carry, sports programming, local and national commercial broadcast television networks, independent syndicators that acquire and resell such rights nationally, regionally and locally, streaming outlets and other Internet and mobile-based distributors of programming. Some of our competitors may own or control, or are owned or controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with, sports teams, leagues or sports promoters, which gives them an advantage in obtaining telecast rights for such teams or sports. For example, two professional sports teams located in New York have ownership interests in programming networks featuring the games of their teams. Distributors may also contract directly with the sports teams in their local service areas for the right to distribute games on their platforms.
The increasing amount of sports programming available on a national basis, including pursuant to national media rights arrangements (e.g., NBA on ABC, ESPN and TNT, and NHL on ABC, ESPN, ESPN+ and TNT), as part of league-controlled sports programming networks (e.g., NBA TV and NHL Network), in out-of-market packages (e.g., NBA League Pass and NHL Center Ice), league and other websites, mobile applications and streaming outlets, may have an adverse impact on our competitive position as our programming networks compete for distribution and for viewers.
Competition for Advertising Revenue
The level of our advertising revenue depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control, the quality and appeal of the competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. See “— Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our MSG Networks Business — We Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising Time and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.”
Competition in Our Tao Group Hospitality Business
Our Tao Group Hospitality business competes with other restaurants and nightlife venues in over 20 markets across five continents. Two of the primary geographic areas in which we operate, New York City and Las Vegas, are among the most competitive markets in the world, with thousands of restaurants and nightlife venues. We also have significant operations in Southern California and London. Our restaurants and nightlife venues outside of New York City and Las Vegas similarly compete with other dining and nightlife options in their respective markets and elsewhere. We compete with these other options on the basis of the quality, location and atmosphere, including the nature and condition of the setting, of our venues, our service, the price, quality and presentation of our food, and the overall experience we provide.
Human Capital Resources 
We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital management objectives are to invest in and support our employees in order to attract, develop and retain a high performing and diverse workforce.
Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”)
We aim to create an employee experience that fosters the Company’s culture of respect. By welcoming the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees, we all share in the creation of a more vibrant, unified, and engaging place to work. To advance these efforts, we maintain a joint Diversity and Inclusion Council (the “D&I Council”) comprised of employees from the Company and MSG Sports who have demonstrated a high level of passion and commitment to diversity and inclusion.
Several D&I Council initiatives have furthered these objectives under our expanded Talent Management, Diversity and Inclusion function led by our VP, Talent Management and Chief Diversity Officer, including:
Workforce: Embedding Diversity and Inclusion through Talent Actions
•Introduced bi-annual workforce demographic dashboards to the extended management team and facilitated four diversity and inclusion content-specific working sessions to advise leaders on strategies to build and retain inclusive teams.

•Revisited our mandatory Inclusive Selection Training for managers and developed guidelines to de-bias talent review conversations with an aim to increase objectivity and consistency around leadership potential.
•Developed an Emerging Talent List to expand our talent pool to better identify and develop high performing diverse talent for expanded roles and promotable opportunities.
Workplace: Building an Inclusive and Accessible Community 
•In Fiscal Year 2022, we launched the MSG Diversity & Inclusion Heritage Month enterprise calendar to acknowledge and celebrate culturally relevant days and months of recognition, anchored by our six employee resource groups: AAPI, Black, LatinX, PRIDE, Veterans, and Women. Viewership of D&I related content on our internal employee communications portal more than doubled year-over-year (combined with MSG Sports). 
•Introduced a Paid Military Leave benefit to support our employees who are called to military service, demonstrating our commitment to be a military-friendly employer. 
•Launched our first employer-branded campaign, “We Are MSG”, reflecting the values of the Company and MSG Sports and the diversity that unites our community. The first video, Faces of MSG, was publicly released on internal and external platforms, anchoring our careers website and LinkedIn page. 
Community: Bridging the Divide through Expansion to Diverse Stakeholders 
•Focused on connecting with minority-owned businesses to increase the diversity of our vendors and suppliers by leveraging employee resource groups and our community, which creates revenue generating opportunities for diverse suppliers to promote their businesses and products. In Fiscal Year 2022, we hosted the Black Fashion Pop-Up Shop and Pride Fest for Black and LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs, respectively. 
•Invested in an external facing supplier diversity portal on our website, which we expect to launch in Fiscal Year 2023. The portal is for diverse suppliers across all spectrums of identity that are interested is doing business with us. 
•Strengthened our commitment to higher education institutions to increase campus recruitment pipelines. In partnership with the Knicks and our social impact team, we hosted the 1st Annual Historically Black Colleges and Universities (“HBCU”) Night highlighting the important contributions of these institutions. In partnership with Chase, we awarded a twenty-five-thousand-dollar scholarship to a Spelman College student. Additionally, we hosted HBCU SpringComing Innovation Lab for select HBCU alumni and students, leveraging their insights to strengthen our recruitment outreach strategy. We also partnered with select City University of New York students to host resume workshops curated and sponsored by the PRIDE employee resource group.
Talent
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 2,200 full-time union and non-union employees and 8,700 part-time union and non-union employees. 
We aim to attract top talent through our prestigious brands and venues, as well as through the many benefits we offer. We aim to retain and develop our talent by emphasizing our competitive rewards, offering opportunities that support employees both personally and professionally, and our commitment to fostering career development in a positive corporate culture.
Our performance management practice includes ongoing feedback and conversations between managers and team members, and talent reviews designed to identify potential future leaders and inform succession plans. We value continuous learning and development opportunities for our employees, which include a career development tool, leadership development programs, a learning platform, and tuition assistance.
Our benefit offerings are designed to meet the range of needs of our diverse workforce and include: domestic partner coverage, an employee assistance program which also provides assistance with child and elder care resources, legal support, pet insurance, wellness programs and financial planning seminars. These resources are intended to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our employees.
As of June 30, 2022, approximately 38% of our employees were represented by unions. Approximately 7% of such union employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) that expired as of June 30, 2022 and approximately 44% are subject to CBAs that will expire by June 30, 2023 if they are not extended prior thereto. Labor relations can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. We have from time to time faced labor action or had to make contingency plans because of threatened or potential labor actions.
COVID-19
The health and safety of our employees, contractors, performing artists, athletes and guests at our venues is our top priority. In response to COVID-19, measures have been taken to ensure that health and safety protocols are in place and enforced throughout our offices and our venues. We also supported our employees through our relief fund, wellness programming and remote working capabilities. We believe we have been able to resume our business operations without sacrificing this commitment to keeping our employees and contractors safe while working on-site.
