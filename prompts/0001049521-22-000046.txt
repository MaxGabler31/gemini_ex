ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Our Company
Mercury Systems, Inc. is a technology company that delivers commercial innovation to rapidly transform the global aerospace and defense industry. Headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, our end-to-end processing platform enables a broad range of aerospace and defense programs, optimized for mission success in some of the most challenging and demanding environments. Processing technologies that comprise our platform include signal solutions, display, software applications, networking, storage and secure processing. Our innovative solutions are mission-ready, software-defined and open and modular, to meet our customers’ high-tech needs. Customers access our solutions via the Mercury platform, which encompasses the broad scope of our investments in technologies, companies, products, services and the expertise of our people. Ultimately, we connect our customers to what matters most to them. We connect commercial technology to defense, people to data, partners to opportunities and the present to the future. At the most human level, we connect what we do to our customers’ missions; supporting the people for whom safety, security and protecting freedom are of paramount importance.
As a leading manufacturer of essential components, products, modules and subsystems, we sell to defense prime contractors, the U.S. government and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) commercial aerospace companies. Mercury has built a trusted, contemporary portfolio of proven product solutions purpose-built for aerospace and defense that it believes meets and exceeds the performance needs of our defense and commercial customers. Customers add their own applications and algorithms to our specialized, secure and innovative products and pre-integrated solutions. This allows them to complete their full system by integrating with their platform, the sensor technology and, increasingly, the processing from Mercury. Our products and solutions are deployed in more than 300 programs with over 25 different defense prime contractors and commercial aviation customers. 
Mercury’s transformational business model accelerates the process of making new technology profoundly more accessible to our customers by bridging the gap between commercial technology and aerospace and defense applications. Our long-standing deep relationships with leading high-tech and other commercial companies, coupled with our high level of research and development (“R&D”) investments on a percentage basis and industry-leading trusted and secure design and manufacturing capabilities, are the foundational tenets of this highly successful model. We are leading the development and adaptation of commercial technology for aerospace and defense solutions. From chip-scale to system scale and from data, including radio frequency (“RF”) to digital to decision, we make mission-critical technologies safe, secure, affordable and relevant for our customers. 
 Our capabilities, technology, people and R&D investment strategy combine to differentiate Mercury in our industry. We maintain our technological edge by investing in critical capabilities and intellectual property (“IP” or “building blocks”) in processing, leveraging open standards and open architectures to adapt quickly those building blocks into solutions for highly data-intensive applications, including emerging needs in areas such as artificial intelligence (“AI”).
Our mission critical solutions are deployed by our customers for a variety of applications including command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“C4ISR”), electronic intelligence, mission computing avionics, electro-optical/infrared (“EO/IR”), electronic warfare, weapons and missile defense, hypersonics and radar. 
Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net income, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2022 were $988.2 million, $117.8 million, $11.3 million, $0.20, $2.19 and $200.5 million, respectively. Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net income, EPS, adjusted EPS and adjusted 
EBITDA for fiscal 2021 were $924.0 million, $3.4 million, $62.0 million, $1.12, $2.42 and $201.9 million, respectively. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this annual report for a reconciliation of our acquired revenues, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
1MPACT
On August 3, 2021, Mercury announced a companywide effort, called 1MPACT, to lay the foundation for the next phase of the Company’s value creation at scale. The goal of 1MPACT is to achieve Mercury’s full growth, margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow potential over the next five years. Since fiscal year 2014, Mercury has completed 15 acquisitions, deploying $1.4 billion of capital and, as a result, dramatically scaled and transformed the business. Over this time, the Company has extracted substantial revenue and cost synergies from each of these individual acquisitions. As we approach the milestone of $1 billion of revenue, we have identified significant opportunity to realize further scale through consolidating and streamlining our internal organizational structure which will improve visibility, speed of decision making and accountability. 1MPACT is led by our Chief Transformation Officer, Thomas Huber, and focuses on the following major areas: organizational efficiency and scalability; procurement and supply chain; facilities optimization; R&D investment; and scalable common processes and systems. 
Our Business Strategy
Mercury’s business strategy is based on a differentiated market position: we make trusted, secure, mission critical technologies profoundly more accessible to the aerospace and defense industry. The Mercury Processing Platform serves customers with cutting-edge commercial technology innovations, purpose built and mission-ready for aerospace and defense applications, through above average industry investment on a percentage basis in R&D. Our strategy is built to meet the aerospace and defense market’s need for speed and affordability.
Our strategies for growth are as follows:
1.Invest to grow organically: Mercury invests in our people, processes, systems and trusted manufacturing assets to support continued organic growth.
2.Expand capabilities, market access and penetration through mergers & acquisitions (“M&A”): We supplement our organic growth by expanding capabilities, market access and penetration through a disciplined M&A process and full acquisition integration to drive cost and revenue synergies.
3.Invest in trusted, secure Innovation that Matters®: Mercury develops leading edge technologies, customized for aerospace and defense applications, through above-average industry investment on a percentage basis in R&D. 
4.Continuously improve operational capability and scalability: We drive transformational and sustainable business improvement and value creation across the enterprise.
5.Attract and retain top talent: We strive to continuously improve operational capability and scalability by attracting, retaining and engaging top talent and supporting and promoting our culture and values.
Our strategies are built around our key strengths as a leading commercial technology company serving the aerospace and defense industry. Our strategies include innovation and investment in scaling existing capabilities, as well as augmenting our capabilities through an acquisition strategy designed to focus on adjacent technologies. We believe our investment in R&D is more than double that of our competitors on a percentage basis. Our consistent strategies allow us to assist our customers, mostly defense prime contractors, to reduce program cost, minimize technical risk, stay on schedule and on budget and ensure trust and security in the supply chain. As a result, we have successfully penetrated strategic programs including Aegis, Patriot, Lower Tier Air & Missile Defense Sensor ("LTAMDS"), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (“SEWIP”), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ("THAAD"), Predator, F-35, Reaper, F-18, F-16 SABR, E2-D Hawkeye, Paveway, Filthy Buzzard, PGK, P-8, Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite (“AIDEWS”), Common Display System (“CDS”), Aviation Mission Common Server ("AMCS") and WIN-T.
We are committed to continued investment and innovation in advanced new products and solutions development to maintain our competitive advantage, including in the fields of RF, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, advanced multi- and many-core sensor processing systems including graphics processing units (“GPUs”), safety-critical design and engineering, processing for AI, embedded security, digital storage, digital radio frequency memory (“DRFM”) solutions, software-defined communications capabilities and advanced security technologies and capabilities. Concurrently, we leverage our engineering and development capabilities, including systems integration, to accelerate our strategy to become a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially-developed, open architecture solutions within the markets we serve. We invest in scalable manufacturing operations in the U.S. to enable rapid, cost-effective deployment of our microelectronics and secure processing solutions to our customers.
Our commercial business model positions us to be compensated for non-recurring engineering which supplements our own internal R&D investment. We typically team concurrently with multiple defense prime contractors as they pursue new business with solutions they develop and market to the government, and engage with our customers early in the design cycle. Our engagement model can lead to long-term production revenue that continues after the initial services are delivered.
We intend to add capabilities, through both M&A and investment in organic growth, both horizontally – in adjacent markets – and vertically – adding more content. For example:
•First, transition to pre-integrated subsystems: Mercury has expanded capabilities, particularly in integrated subsystems related to defense threats and increased system complexity, which in turn has driven greater outsourcing to us from our prime defense contractor and OEM customers. 
•Second, expansion into new submarkets: Within the major markets Mercury serves we have moved, for example, into electronic warfare, weapons systems, acoustics submarkets, C4I and mission computing.
•Third, vertical expansion: As we continue to add content, we seek to apply technology to all computers on aerospace and defense platforms that require trusted, safe and secure processing.
•Fourth, microelectronics: Our investment domestically in next-generation chiplet technology, from chip-scale to system scale.
Since July 2015, we have added substantial capabilities to our technology portfolio including: embedded security, with the acquisitions of Lewis Innovative Technologies Inc. (“LIT”), custom microelectronics, RF and microwave solutions and embedded security, with the carve-out acquisition from Microsemi Corporation (the “Carve-Out Business”), The Athena Group, Inc. (“Athena”), Delta Microwave, LLC (“Delta”), Syntonic Microwave LLC (“Syntonic”), Pentek Technologies, LLC and Pentek Systems, Inc. (collectively, "Pentek") and Atlanta Micro, Inc. ("Atlanta Micro"); mission computing, safety-critical avionics and platform management and large area display technology with the CES Creative Electronic Systems, S.A. (“CES”), Richland Technologies, L.L.C. (“RTL”), GECO Avionics, LLC (“GECO”), American Panel Corporation (“APC”), Physical Optics Corporation ("POC") and Avalex Technologies, LLC. ("Avalex") acquisitions; and rugged servers, computers and storage systems with the acquisitions of Themis Computer (“Themis”) and Germane Systems, LC (“Germane”).
We believe we have built the most trusted, proven, contemporary portfolio of solutions and sub-systems that are purpose-built to meet or exceed our customers’ most pressing high-tech needs. We are investing in mission-critical processing technologies embedded into our Processing Platform:
•Security.     Industry-leading embedded security capabilities, secure supply chain, U.S. manufacturing facilities and data management practices for highly sensitive missions.
•Signal. Broadband microwave technology, high-speed digitization, low-latency processing, purpose-built for mission-critical applications.
•Display. Smart, rugged, interactive, high-definition display technology optimized for the low-light, multi-angle viewing requirements of cockpits and armored vehicles.
•Software. The most advanced open middleware and software facilitates rapid application porting on top of open mission systems architecture.
•Networking. Open, interoperable and secure networking based on widely adopted commercial protocols and standards to enable connectivity from data to decision.
•Storage. Fast, radiation-tolerant and encrypted data-at-rest solutions to securely store the vast amounts of data produced by sophisticated edge sensors.

Our Solutions and Products
We deliver technology at the intersection of the high-tech and defense industries. The Mercury difference is driven by key "differentiators" we promise to deliver to all of our customers: Mission-Ready; Trusted and Secure; Software-Defined; and Open and Modular.
•Mission-Ready: Fit for purpose to meet the demanding needs of our customers' missions. Advanced thermal management and rugged packaging technology ensures optimal performance and reliable operation in the most challenging environments on earth and beyond. We deliver extended reliability and dependability through thermal management, component selection, environmental protection and testing. 
•Trusted and Secure: A trusted supply chain, with products designed and manufactured onshore. Advanced cryptography, secure boot and physical protection technologies like our BuiltSECURE technology can mitigate reverse 
engineering, deliver cyber resiliency and safeguard confidential data and IP against adversarial threats, even when a system has been compromised. We also design safety-certifiable BuiltSAFE processing systems up to the highest design assurance levels.
•Software-Defined: Software enabled hardware for futureproofing, rapid scaling, ease of maintenance and affordability. Flexible hardware architectures that are reconfigurable and upgradeable with software to extend the life of our systems and the platforms they are deployed on. Our model-based systems engineering ("MBSE") design approach aims to significantly decrease the time and cost involved in developing and deploying Military and Aerospace platforms.
•Open and Modular: "Plug and play", upgradeable and scalable. A modular, open, systems architecture ("MOSA") approach to system design maximizes technology reuse to dramatically reduce development time and cost. This open systems approach mitigates obsolescence risk while emphasizing commonality, interoperability and sustainability across platforms and domains. 
The Mercury Processing Platform is designed to meet the full range of requirements in compute-intensive, signal processing, image processing and command and control applications. To maintain a competitive advantage, we seek to leverage technology investments across multiple product lines and product solutions. Examples of hardware products include small, custom microelectronics, embedded sensor processing subsystems, RF and microwave components, modules and subsystems, rugged servers and avionics mission computers.
Our products are typically compute-intensive and require extremely high bandwidth and high throughput. These systems often must also meet significant SWaP constraints for use in aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), ships and other platforms and be ruggedized for use in harsh environments. They are primarily used in both commercial aerospace applications, such as communications and ground radar air traffic control, as well as advanced defense and intelligence applications, including space-time adaptive processing, synthetic aperture radar, airborne early warning, command, control, communication and information systems, mission planning, image intelligence and signal intelligence systems. Our products transform the massive streams of digital data created in these applications into usable information in real time. The systems can scale from a few processors to thousands of processors.
We group our products into the following categories:
•Components. Components represent the basic building blocks of an electronic system. They generally perform a single function such as switching, storing or converting electronic signals. Some examples include power amplifiers and limiters, switches, oscillators, filters, equalizers, digital and analog converters, chips, MMICs (monolithic microwave integrated circuits) and memory and storage devices.
•Modules and Subassemblies. Modules and sub-assemblies combine multiple components to serve a range of complex functions, including processing, networking and graphics display. Typically delivered as computer boards or other packaging, modules and sub-assemblies are usually designed using open standards to provide interoperability when integrated in a subsystem. Examples of modules and sub-assemblies include embedded processing boards, switched fabrics and boards for high-speed input/output, digital receivers, graphics and video, along with multi-chip modules, integrated radio frequency and microwave multi-function assemblies and radio frequency tuners and transceivers.
•Integrated Subsystems. Integrated subsystems bring components, modules and/or sub-assemblies into one system, enabled with software. Subsystems are typically, but not always, integrated within an open standards-based chassis and often feature interconnect technologies to enable communication between disparate systems. Spares and replacement modules and sub-assemblies are provided for use with subsystems sold by us. Our subsystems are deployed in sensor processing, aviation and mission computing and C4I applications.
By providing pre-integrated subsystems to our customers, we enable them to rapidly and cost-effectively port and adapt their applications to changing threats. This approach also saves our customers valuable time and expense, as their initial costs to integrate modules and components typically far exceed the costs of the individual product procurement. This benefit continues over time because we are continually investing R&D into our products. This allows us to provide our customers the latest technologies in our pre-integrated subsystems faster than they can typically do it themselves. We believe this is a better business and technology model to operate within, as it continues to provide value and benefits to us and our customers over time.
To address the current challenges facing the warfighter, our government and defense prime contractors, we have developed a new product architecture that supports a more dynamic, iterative, spiral development process by leveraging open architecture standards and leading-edge commercial technologies and products. Our open architecture is carried throughout our entire embedded computing product line from the very small form-factor subsystems to the high-end, where ultimate processing power and reliability is of paramount importance to the mission. Our commercially-developed product capabilities cover the entire intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”) spectrum from acquisition and digitization of the signal, to processing of the signal, through the exploitation and dissemination of the information. We work continuously to improve our hardware technology with an eye toward optimization of SWaP demands.
We partner with global tech leaders to align technology roadmaps and deliver cutting-edge computing in scalable, field-deployable form factors that are fully configurable to each unique workload. We use the latest Intel® server-class processing products, Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Arrays (“FPGA”), as well as NVIDIA GPU products in our embedded high-performance processing technologies. While this multi-computing and embedded processing technology is one of our core skills, the SWaP constraints that are encountered in connection with the high-performance embedded processing applications create unique challenges. For example, to deal with the heat build-up involved in small subsystems, we introduced a key technology called Air Flow-By™ that enables previously unattainable levels of processing power within a small footprint by effectively removing heat so the server-class processors can perform at maximum designed power limits. In rugged environments where air is limited, such as high-altitude operations, our Liquid-Flow-By™ technology has been successfully customer tested allowing maximum server-class processor performance. These innovative cooling techniques allow full performance server-class processing in rugged environments enabling new and advanced modes of operation that enhance the multi-intelligence, situational awareness and electronic warfare capabilities in military platforms.
Embedded systems security has become a requirement for new and emerging military programs and our security solutions are a critical differentiator from our traditional competition. Our security solutions, combined with our next-generation secure Intel® server-class product line, together with increasingly frequent mandates from the government to secure electronic systems for domestic and foreign military sales, position us well to capitalize on DoD program protection security requirements. Finally, our built-in security framework creates higher product differentiation, and drives greater program velocity, while lowering risk.
Open Standards Support
Mercury has a long history of driving modular open systems architectures and has remained committed to creating, advancing and adopting open standards for all our products, from our smallest components and connectors to our largest, high-performance, integrated multi-computer systems. With forty years of technology leadership within the high-performance embedded computing industry, we have pioneered or contributed to the development of many of the defense industry’s current and emerging open standards, including standards such as RACEway, RapidIO, VXS, VPX, REDI and notably OpenVPX. These open standards allow system integrators to benefit from the interoperability of modules produced by multiple vendors. We also continue to be influential in the industry-standards organizations associated with our market segments. As a member of the VMEbus International Trade Association (“VITA”), the Sensor Open Systems Architecture (“SOSA”) initiative, the Future Airborne Capability Environment (“FACE”) consortium and the Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW Interoperability (“VICTORY”) consortium, among other standards bodies, Mercury is helping to guide the aerospace and defense industry toward greater openness and vendor interoperability, consistent with the DoD’s focus on using MOSA in major programs.
Our software is based on open standards and includes heterogeneous processor support with extensive highly-optimized math libraries, multi-computing switch fabric support, net-centric and system management enabling services, extended operating system services, board support packages and development tools. This software platform delivers on the performance required for highly tuned real-time operation with the flexibility of open standards that are an essential ingredient of technology insertion and software life-cycle support.
As the U.S. government mandates more outsourcing and open standards, a major shift is occurring within the defense prime contractor community towards procurement of integrated subsystems that enable quick application level porting through standards-based methodologies. We believe that our core expertise in this area is well aligned to capitalize on this trend. By leveraging our open architecture and high-performance modular product set, we provide defense prime contractors with rapid deployment and quick reaction capabilities through our professional services and systems integration offerings. This results in less risk for the defense prime contractors, shortened development cycles, quicker solution deployment and reduced life-cycle costs.
Commitment to Deliver Uncompromised
For Mercury, this means ensuring our products and solutions have not been and cannot be tampered with, and that what we deliver to our customers is not compromised at any point during the development lifecycle, from procurement to manufacturing. Our holistic approach to deliver uncompromised includes:
•vigorously mitigating potential insider threats;
•proactively protecting our IT infrastructure with strong cybersecurity defenses;
•effectively managing and assessing our suppliers’ controls; and
•judiciously controlling design information through the entire development process.
We are investing in digital transformation, insider trust, cybersecurity, supply chain management and trusted microelectronics, all integral to our commitment to being a leader in delivering uncompromised solutions to our customers.

Our Market Opportunity
Our market opportunity is defined by the growing demand for domestically designed, sourced and manufactured electronics for critical aerospace, defense and intelligence applications. Our primary market positioning is centered on making commercially available technologies profoundly more accessible to the aerospace and defense sector, specifically as it relates to command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) systems, sensors and electronic warfare (EW); and commercial markets, which include aerospace communications and other computing applications. We believe we are well-positioned in growing sustainable market segments of the aerospace and defense sector that rely on advanced technologies to improve warfighter capability and provide enhanced force protection capabilities. The acquisitions of the Carve-Out Business, Delta, Syntonic, Pentek and Atlanta Micro further improved our ability to compete successfully in these market segments by allowing us to offer an even more comprehensive set of closely related capabilities. The CES, RTL, GECO, APC, POC and Avalex acquisitions provided us new capabilities that substantially expanded our addressable market into defense platform management, mission computing and commercial aerospace markets that are aligned to our existing market focus. The additions of Themis and Germane provided us with new capabilities and positioned us with a significant footprint within the rugged server business. Our organic investments as well as the acquisitions of LIT, the Carve-Out Business and Athena added to our portfolio of embedded security products that can be leveraged across our business. Finally, our CES addition, due to its location in Geneva, is helping to open more opportunities in international markets.
We believe there are a number of evolving trends that are reshaping our target markets and accordingly provide us with attractive growth opportunities. These trends include:
•The aerospace and defense electronics market is expected to grow in 2022 and beyond. According to Renaissance Strategic Advisors (“RSA”), as of September 2021, the global aerospace and defense electronics market is estimated to be $130 billion in 2021, growing to $155 billion by 2026. Within this global market, RSA estimates that the total Tier 2 defense electronics market, which Mercury participates in, was approximately $40 billion in 2021, and will grow to $52 billion in 2026. The aerospace and defense electronics marketplace consists of two primary subsegments: (i) C4I and (ii) sensor and effector mission systems. C4I encompasses platform and mission management, which include avionics and vetronics, C2I, which includes command and control and intelligence, and dedicated communications processing. Sensor and effector mission systems are primarily different types of sensor modalities such as EW, radar, EO/IR and acoustics as well as weapons systems such as missiles and munitions. Within the global Tier 2 C4I market in which we participate, RSA estimated the market for 2021 to be $6.7 billion for platform and mission management, $8.3 billion for C2I and $8.9 billion for dedicated communications. RSA estimates the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2021-2026 for these markets to be 6.3% for platform and mission management, 4.5% for C2I and 3.7% for dedicated communications. Within the global Tier 2 sensor and effector mission systems market in which we 
participate, RSA estimated the market for 2021 to be $5.8 billion for EW, $5.8 billion for radar, $2.1 billion for EO/IR, $1.2 billion for acoustics and $3.4 billion for weapons systems. RSA estimates the 2021-2026 CAGR for these markets to be 2.6% for electronic warfare, 2.6% for radar, 3.4% for EO/IR, 3.7% for acoustics and 4.1% for weapons systems. Within the context of the overall U.S. defense budget and spending for defense electronics specifically, we believe the C4ISR, EW, guided missiles and precision munitions and ballistic missile defense market segments have a high priority for future DoD spending. We continue to build on our strengths in the design and development of performance optimized electronic subsystems for these markets, and often team with multiple defense prime contractors as they bid for projects, thereby increasing our chance of a successful outcome. We expect to continue our above industry-average growth.
•The rapidly expanding demand for tactical ISR is leading to significant growth in sensor data being generated, leading to even greater demand for the capability of our products to securely store and process data onboard platforms. An increase in the prevalence and resolution of ISR is generating significant growth in the associated data that needs to be stored and turned into information for the warfighter in a timely manner. In addition, several factors are driving the defense and intelligence industries to demand greater capability to collect, store and process data onboard the aircraft, UAVs, ships and other vehicles, which we refer to collectively as platforms. These factors include the limited communications bandwidth of existing platforms, the need for platforms that can operate more autonomously and possibly in denied communications environments, the need for platforms with increased persistence to enable them to remain in or fly above the battlefield for extended periods and the need for greater onboard processing capabilities. In addition, the advent of sophisticated AI algorithms is beginning to revolutionize the ability of sensor processing systems to intelligently and efficiently process and act upon these large data sets. Standard computing architectures and computing platforms currently do not offer the level of performance needed to optimize existing AI algorithms, creating an additional opportunity for advanced processing capabilities onboard the platform.
•Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, rising tensions in the Asia-Pacific and continued threats from rogue states and violent extremists are contributing to the most challenging global threat environment since the Cold War. This will likely result in a sea change in defense spending domestically and internationally. Our advisors estimate that U.S. growth, combined with increases in NATO defense budgets, could drive up to $1.5 trillion of additional spending over the next decade. This should lead to higher bookings for Mercury in the electronic systems associated with missiles, munitions and missile defense systems, unmanned systems, fixed wing and rotorcraft, ground vehicles and EW.
•A greater percentage of the value associated with future defense platforms will be driven by electronic systems content, and upgrades to existing platforms will focus on sensors, signal processing, sensor algorithms, multi-intelligence fusion and exploitation and computing and communications capability– all areas where Mercury participates. These trends remain favorable in our view and the demand environment is improving due to urgent needs for warfighting capability at a more rapid pace than traditional defense prime contractors can easily react to, as demonstrated by our strong bookings and design wins, both in fiscal 2022. We believe that our addressable market continues to increase, driven in large part by our strategic move into mission systems and potential to deliver innovative processing solutions at chip scale, and that primes will increasingly seek out our high-performance, cost-effective open architecture products.
•Defense procurement reform is causing the defense prime contractors to outsource more work to commercial companies and we believe that prime contractor outsourcing is our largest secular growth opportunity. RSA estimates that in 2021 the U.S. defense Tier 2 embedded computing and RF market addressable by suppliers such as Mercury was approximately $24 billion. RSA estimates that the U.S. defense prime contractors currently outsource only a small percentage of their work. On a global basis the Tier 2 embedded computing and RF market in 2021 was estimated by RSA to be $42 billion. The U.S. government is intensely focused on making systems more affordable and shortening their development time. In addition, the U.S. government is challenging defense prime contractors to leverage commercial technology wherever possible. This trend, along with a scarcity of technical and engineering talent in the market, is causing defense prime contractors to outsource to companies like Mercury, which we believe is our largest secular growth opportunity. As a merchant supplier of commercial technologies to the defense industry, we believe our products and subsystem solutions are often more affordable than solutions with the same functionality developed by a defense prime contractor. In addition, we believe our size, scale and stability in addition to the investments we have made in our domestic manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure, make us a more reliable and attractive outsourcing partner for our customers relative to smaller sub-scale providers. These factors are providing incentives for defense prime contractors to outsource more work to subcontractors with significant expertise and cost-effective technology capabilities and solutions, and we have transformed our business model over the last several years to address these long-term outsourcing trends and other needs.
•DoD security and program protection requirements are creating new opportunities for domestic sourcing and our advanced secure processing capabilities. The U.S. government is focused on ensuring that the U.S. military protects its defense electronic systems and the information held within them from nefarious activities such as tampering, 
reverse engineering and other forms of advanced attacks, including cyber. The requirement to add security comes at a time when the commercial technology world continues to offshore more of the design, development, manufacturing and support of such capabilities, making it more difficult to protect against embedded vulnerabilities, tampering, reverse engineering and other undesired activities. The DoD has a mandate to ensure both the provenance and integrity of the technology and its associated supply chain. These factors have created a unique opportunity for us to expand beyond sensor processing into the provision of technologies ranging from advanced secure processing subsystems to miniaturized custom microelectronics devices and capabilities for other onboard critical computing applications designed, developed, manufactured and supported in the U.S.A. In addition, advanced systems sold to foreign military buyers also require protection so that the technologies, techniques and data associated with them do not proliferate, which further enhances our market opportunity.
•Mercury is well-positioned to help address the need for DoD to access the latest commercial silicon, combined with the desire to ensure a trusted domestic supply of silicon technologies. In February 2022, DoD’s Research & Engineering (R&E) organization listed microelectronics among its top technology investment priorities and reiterated its need for secure microelectronics sources which leverage state-of-the-art commercial development and production. DoD’s FY23 budget requested $989 million in funding for basic research in microelectronics – the largest increase among R&E’s investment priorities and 40% of the total basic research budget. Congress’ passage of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors ("CHIPS") act in August 2022, which will provide $2 billion for defense microelectronics, further amplifies the U.S. government’s commitment to reinforcing the U.S. semiconductor supply chain. We believe Mercury is the leading provider of commercially developed silicon purpose-built for the specific requirements of aerospace and defense customers. This capability began with our 2016 acquisition of the Carve-Out Business, which included capabilities in trusted and secure microelectronics. Since the acquisition, we have made additional investments in security and advanced packaging, most notably our announced $15 million capital investment in fiscal year 2020 to expand our trusted custom microelectronics business in Phoenix, Arizona, to bring cutting-edge commercial silicon to the DoD. This initiative is specifically intended to bridge DoD technologies from monolithic ASIC designs, which are purpose-built for DoD but are deployed on legacy silicon designs, to heterogeneous “chiplet” architectures, which leverage best-of-breed silicon from commercial providers and packages the silicon for defense-specific applications, including the ability to embed security into the device itself.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to take advantage of the evolving trends in our industry and successfully pursue our business strategy:
•Subsystem Solutions Provider for the C4ISR and Electronic Warfare Markets. Through our commercially developed, specialized processing subsystem solutions, we address the challenges associated with the collection and processing of massive, continuous streams of data and dramatically shorten the time that it takes to give information to U.S. armed forces at the tactical edge. Our solutions are specifically designed for flexibility and interoperability, allowing our products to be easily integrated into larger system-level solutions. Our ability to integrate subsystem-level capabilities allows us to provide solutions that effectively address the mission-critical challenges within the C4ISR market, including multi-intelligence data fusion and AI processing onboard the platform. We leverage our deep expertise in embedded multicomputing, embedded sensor processing, with the addition of our RF microwave and millimeter subsystems and components, along with strategic investments in research and development to provide solutions across the sensor processing chain.

In addition, we consistently leverage our technology and capabilities across multiple programs, providing significant operating leverage and cost savings. Our recent acquisitions allow us to participate in a broader array of programs, many with key strategic customers of ours.
•We are a leading technology company serving the aerospace and defense industry. We have a portfolio of Open Standards Architecture (“OSA”) technology building blocks across the entire sensor processing chain. We offer embedded secure processing capabilities with advanced packaging and cooling technologies that ruggedize commercial technologies while allowing them to stay cool for reliable operation. These capabilities allow us to help our customers meet the demanding SWaP requirements of today’s defense platforms. Our pre-integrated subsystems improve affordability by substantially reducing customer system integration costs and time-to-market for our solutions. System integration costs are one of the more substantial costs our customers bear in developing and deploying 
technologies in defense programs and platforms. Our pre-integrated solutions approach allows for more rapid and affordable modernization of existing platforms and faster deployment of new platforms.
Our strengths in this area include our position as an early and leading advocate for OSA in defense, offering Intel® server class processing form factors across 3/6U OpenVPX, ATCA and rack-mount architectures and high density, secure solutions across multiple hardware architectures to seamlessly scale to meet our customers’ SWaP requirements. In addition, we have a 30-year legacy of system management and system integration expertise that allows us to reduce technical risk, while improving affordability and interoperability. Our system integration expertise is a cornerstone in helping us support our customers in deploying pre-integrated, OSA subsystems.
As commercial technology companies have moved the design, development, manufacturing and support of their technologies offshore, the DoD is looking to domestic technology providers to develop a sustainable, U.S.-based trusted supply chain. Over several years we have been building out our capacity for domestic manufacturing through our Advanced Microelectronics Centers (“AMCs”). These facilities provide significant scale and capacity for our defense prime customers, who have been increasingly willing to outsource to partners with the scale needed to meet large program production requirements. In addition, our Phoenix, Arizona AMC is a Defense Microelectronics Activity (“DMEA”)-certified, trusted manufacturing facility, which represents a significant competitive advantage. Our Phoenix AMC also includes a surface mount technology manufacturing capability which we refer to as our U.S. Manufacturing Operations (“USMO”).
•We provide advanced, integrated security features for our products and subsystems, addressing an increasingly prevalent requirement for DoD program security. We offer secure processing expertise that is built-in to our pre-integrated subsystems. By doing this we are able to provide secure building blocks that allow our customers to also incorporate their own security capabilities. This assists our customers in ensuring program protection as they deploy critical platforms and programs, all in support of DoD missions. The acquisition of the Carve-Out Business brought us new security technologies and also allowed us to provide enhanced security capabilities in areas such as memory and storage devices. Our acquisitions of the Carve-Out Business, LIT and Athena also added to our portfolio of sophisticated firmware and software specifically designed to secure microelectronic devices that can be leveraged across our product portfolio.
•We are pioneering a next generation business model. The DoD and the defense industrial base is currently undergoing a major transformation. Domestic political and budget uncertainty, geopolitical instability and evolving global threats have become constants. The defense budget remains under pressure and R&D and technology spending are often in budgetary competition with the increasing costs of military personnel requirements, health care costs and other important elements within the DoD and the Federal budget generally. Finally, defense acquisition reform calls for the continued drive for innovation and competition within the defense industrial base, while also driving down acquisition costs. Our approach is built around a few key pillars:
•We continue to leverage our expertise in building pre-integrated subsystems in support of critical defense programs, driving out procurement costs by lowering integration expenses of our customers.
•We have been a pioneer in driving OSA for both embedded computing and RF.
•The DoD has asked defense industry participants to invest their own resources into R&D. This approach is a pillar of our business model.
•Security and program protection are now critical considerations for both program modernizations as well as for new program deployment. We are now in our fourth generation of building secure embedded processing solutions.
We have a next generation business model built to meet the emerging needs of the DoD.
•Value-Added Subsystem Solution Provider for Defense Prime Contractors. Because of the DoD’s continuing shift toward a firm fixed price contract procurement model, an increasingly uncertain budgetary and procurement environment, and increased budget pressures from both the U.S. and allied governments, defense prime contractors are accelerating their move toward outsourcing opportunities to help mitigate the increased program and financial risk. Our differentiated secure sensor and safety-critical processing solutions offer meaningful capabilities upgrades for our customers and enable the rapid, cost-effective deployment of systems to the end customer. We believe our open architecture subsystems offer differentiated sensor processing and data analytics capabilities that cannot be easily replicated. Our solutions minimize program risk, maximize application portability and accelerate customers’ time to market, all within a fixed-pricing contracting environment.
•Delivery of Platform-Ready Solutions for Classified Programs. We believe our integration work provides us with critical insights as we implement and incorporate key classified government intellectual property, including critical intelligence and signal processing algorithms, into advanced systems. This integration work provides us the opportunity to combine directly and integrate our technology building blocks along with our intellectual property into 
our existing embedded processing products and solutions, enabling us to deliver more affordable, platform-ready integrated ISR subsystems that leverage our OSA and address key government technology and procurement concerns. Our operations in this environment also help us identify emerging needs and opportunities to influence our future product development, so that critical future needs can be met in a timely manner with commercially-developed products and solutions.
•We have invested in advanced, domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Over the past several years we have prioritized investments to build our internal capabilities and capacity for defense electronics design and manufacturing in the U.S. These investments include the consolidation of a number of sub-scale microelectronics manufacturing facilities into our modern AMCs as well as the establishment of our USMO in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition to the consolidation of facilities into scalable engineering and manufacturing centers of excellence, we have made the necessary investments to outfit these facilities with modern, scalable and redundant tools and equipment to promote quality, efficiency, throughput and redundancy. In addition we invested in our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure and business systems to meet Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”) requirements for cybersecurity. These investments taken together are intended to demonstrate our commitment to meeting DoD expectations for a trusted and secure defense industrial base. Our AMCs in Hudson, New Hampshire, West Caldwell, New Jersey, Oxnard, California, Huntsville, Alabama and Phoenix, Arizona are strategically located near key customers and are purpose-built for the design, build and test of RF components and subsystems in support of a variety of key customer programs. Our USMO is built around scalable, repeatable, secure, affordable and predictable manufacturing. The USMO is a IPC1791 certified secure trusted site, certified to AS9100 quality standards and it utilizes Lean Six Sigma methodologies throughout manufacturing. The USMO is designed for efficient manufacturing, enabling our customers to access the best proven technology and high performing, secure processing solutions. This allows for the most repeatable product performance, while optimizing affordability and production responsiveness.
