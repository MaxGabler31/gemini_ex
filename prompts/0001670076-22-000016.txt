ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Frontier Airlines is an ultra low-cost carrier whose business strategy is focused on Low Fares Done Right. We are headquartered in Denver, Colorado and offer flights throughout the United States and to select near international destinations in the Americas. As of December 31, 2021, we had a fleet of 110 Airbus single-aisle aircraft, consisting of 16 A320ceos, 73 A320neos and 21 A321ceos. Our unique strategy is underpinned by our low-cost structure and superior low-fare brand. 
The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has presented significant challenges to the global airline industry since March 2020. The rapid spread of COVID-19, along with government-mandated restrictions on travel, required stay-in-place orders, and other social distancing measures, resulted in a drastic decline in near-term air travel demand in the United States, and caused reductions in revenues and income levels as compared to corresponding pre-pandemic periods. The decline in demand for air travel has had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Although we have seen significant recovery of demand through the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the corresponding prior year period, we are unable to predict the future spread of COVID-19, including future variants of the virus such as the recent Delta and Omicron variants, as well as efficacy and adherence rates of vaccines and related boosters and the resulting measures that may be introduced by governments or other parties and what impact those measures may have on the demand for air travel. 
Our History 
We were incorporated in September 2013 as a newly-formed corporation initially wholly-owned by an investment fund managed by Indigo Denver Management Company, LLC (“Indigo”), an affiliate of Indigo Partners, LLC (“Indigo Partners”), an experienced and successful global investor in ULCCs. Indigo facilitated the acquisition of Frontier and its holding company from Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (“Republic”). That acquisition was completed on December 3, 2013. Following the acquisition, Indigo reshaped our management team to include experienced veterans of the airline industry with significant history operating ULCCs. Working with Indigo, our management team developed and implemented our unique strategy, Low Fares Done Right. 
Recent Developments
On February 2, 2022, we repaid our debt facility with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) which included the $150 million principal balance along with accrued interest of $1 million. The repayment terminated the loan agreement and unencumbered our co-branded credit card program and related brand assets that secured the loan. See Note 2 for more information. 
On February 5, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Top Gun Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”), and Spirit Airlines, Inc. (“Spirit”). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, the Merger Sub will be merged with and into Spirit (the “Merger”), with Spirit surviving the Merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. 
The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including, but not limited to (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Spirit’s stockholders; (2) the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other required regulatory approvals including the receipt of all consents, registrations, notices, waivers, exemptions, approvals, confirmations, clearances, permits, certificates, orders, and authorizations of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), and the Federal Communications 
Commission (“FCC”); (3) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the transactions; (4) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering shares of our common stock to be issued in the Merger; (5) the authorization and approval for listing on NASDAQ of our shares to be issued to holders of Spirit’s common stock in the Merger; (6) the accuracy of the parties’ respective representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, subject to specified materiality qualifications; and (7) compliance by the parties with their respective covenants in the Merger Agreement in all material respects. 
Subsequent to the closing of the Merger and at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Spirit, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding (other than shares owned by us, Spirit, or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time) will be converted into the right to receive 1.9126 of our shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and $2.13 per share in cash, without interest. 
The Merger Agreement also specifies termination rights for both Spirit and us including, without limitation, a right for either party to terminate the Merger if it is not consummated on or before February 5, 2023, subject to certain extensions if needed to obtain regulatory approvals. If the Merger Agreement were to be terminated in specified circumstances, Spirit would be required to pay us a termination fee of $94.2 million.
We currently expect the Merger to occur in the second half of 2022, although there can be no assurance regarding timing of completion of regulatory processes. The Merger Agreement also includes a methodology by which certain expenses will be borne by each company. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not incur any transaction or integration planning costs related to the planned Merger.
Following the closing of the Merger, we expect the combined company to bring ultra-low fares to travelers in more destinations across the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, by accelerating investments in innovation and growth and by competing even more aggressively with larger competitors on domestic routes. 
Our Business Model 
Our business model is based on our unique Low Fares Done Right strategy. While our strategy is similar to the business models utilized by other ULCCs, including with respect to low-cost structure, low fares and flexible optional services, we believe Low Fares Done Right differentiates us from other U.S. ULCCs as a result of our focus on delivering a higher-quality, family-friendly customer experience with a more upscale look and feel than traditionally experienced on ULCCs globally. From the perspective of our customers, our business model provides a product offering that combines low base fares with dependable customer service, a customer-friendly digital platform, a rewarding frequent flyer program, a modern fleet, comfortable cabin seating, flexible optional services and operational integrity. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
Our competitive strengths include: 
Our Low-Cost Structure. Our low-cost structure, built around low aircraft ownership cost, fuel efficiency and low operational costs, is our key strategic advantage. Our unit costs, measured by Adjusted CASM including net interest, were the lowest in the industry for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our low-cost structure is driven by several factors: 
•high aircraft utilization;
•modern, fuel-efficient, high-capacity fleet and attractive order book;
•low-cost distribution model, with our services primarily sold through direct distribution channels including our website, mobile app and call center;
•highly productive workforce and third-party specialist providers; and
•outsourcing model for non-core functions, including customer call centers, lost bag services, ground handling services and catering services. 
Our Brand. We believe establishing our brand as a leading low-fare airline enhances our ability to generate customer loyalty. The key features of our brand include:
•significant customer value delivered through low fares with the choice of reasonably priced unbundled and bundled options, including The Works and The Perks;
•family-friendly elements that appeal to a large audience, such as an attentive staff, popular animals on our aircraft tails, novelty cards for children and certain offers tailored for families including our Kids Fly Free program;
•a commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, including our position as “America’s greenest Airline” as measured by fuel efficiency;
•a carefully curated aesthetic for our livery, our website and mobile app, uniforms, seat design and on-board products, which are designed to look and feel more upscale than traditional ULCCs;
•a strong online presence with a customer-friendly digital platform that includes our passenger reservation system, improved website and mobile app;
•our modern fleet with amenities such as extra seat padding and our exit row and Stretch seating options, which provide up to a comfortable 53-inch seat pitch depending on aircraft type; and
•an enhanced frequent flyer program, Frontier Miles, and Discount Den membership program. 
Our Network Management. We plan our route network and airport footprint to focus on profitable existing routes and new routes where we believe our business model will stimulate demand and growth, including those where we expect demand to be highest as the U.S. market continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy has enabled us to reduce the seasonality of our revenue, improve utilization, lower unit costs, increase revenues and enhance profitability from 2013 through 2019, prior to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The key features of our network include: 
•a broad geographic footprint, which enables us to service a wide range of visiting friends or relatives (“VFR”) and vacation destinations;
•a strong presence in high-demand markets and underserved markets, including mid-sized cities;
•a disciplined and methodical approach to both route selection and the removal of underperforming routes; and
•an operational platform that includes nationwide crew and maintenance bases, creating access to lower-risk growth opportunities while maintaining high operational standards and enabling high utilization.
Our Talented ULCC Leadership Team. Our management team has extensive day-to-day experience operating ULCCs and other airlines. 
•Barry L. Biffle, our President and Chief Executive Officer, previously served as Chief Executive Officer for VivaColombia, Executive Vice President for Spirit and held various management roles with US Airways and American Eagle Airlines, a regional airline subsidiary of American Airlines;
•James G. Dempsey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, previously served as Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations for Ryanair after serving in management roles within the advisory practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers;

•Craig R. Maccubbin, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, previously served as Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer for WestJet Airlines, Chief Technology Officer for Southwest Airlines and Chief Information Officer for Spirit;
•Daniel M. Shurz, our Senior Vice President, Commercial, previously served in various roles with United Airlines and Air Canada; and
•Trevor J. Stedke, our Senior Vice President, Operations, previously served as Vice President, Aircraft Technical Operations for Southwest Airlines.
Our Business Strategy— Low Fares Done Right
Our goal is to offer the most attractive option for air travel with a compelling combination of value, product, and service, and, in so doing, to grow profitably and enhance our position among airlines in the United States. Through the key elements of our business strategy, we seek to achieve: 
Low Unit Costs. We intend to strengthen and maintain our low unit costs, including by: 
•maintaining high utilization levels as the U.S. market continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic; 
•utilizing new generation, fuel-efficient aircraft that deliver lower operating costs compared to prior generation aircraft;
•increasing the average size and seat capacity of the aircraft in our fleet through the continued introduction and operation of new 186-seat A320neo aircraft and the expected future introduction of up-to-240-seat A321neo aircraft; and
•taking a disciplined approach to our operational performance in order to reduce disruption. 
A Superior Low-Fare Brand. In order to enhance our brand and drive revenue growth, we intend to continue to deliver a higher-quality flight experience than historically offered by ULCCs globally and generate customer loyalty by: 
•continuing to offer attractive low fares;
•expanding our marketing efforts, including through the addition of new animals for each of our new aircraft, particularly highlighting endangered species on our signature animal tails, to continue to position our brand as a family- and environmentally-friendly ULCC;
•continuing to improve penetration of our bundle options, including The Works and The Perks;
•further enhancing our Frontier Miles offering to improve reward opportunities for our branded credit card customers; and
•providing our customers a dependable, reliable, on-time and friendly travel experience. 
Strong Growth Driven by an Expanding and Efficient Network. We believe that our cost structure enables us to fly to more places profitably than any other U.S. airline, and we strategically focus on routes that we believe are the most profitable. We intend to continue to utilize our disciplined and methodical approach to expand our network in an efficient manner, including by: 
•strategically deploying our capacity where demand is highest as the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues;
•continuing to take advantage of opportunities in overpriced and/or underserved markets across the U.S. and select international destinations in the Americas; 
•leveraging our diverse geographic footprint and existing crew and maintenance base infrastructure to take advantage of lower-risk network growth opportunities while maintaining high operational standards;
•utilizing our low-cost structure to offer low fares which organically drive growth through market stimulation;
•continuing to rebalance our network to mitigate seasonal fluctuations in our results; and
•focusing on what we believe are the most profitable opportunities where our cost differential drives the largest competitive advantage.
Strong Liquidity and Capital Structure. We intend to maintain our strong capital structure, which enables us to obtain financing for our aircraft pursuant to attractive operating leases, in order to support our growth strategies and the expansion of our fleet and network. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had $918 million of cash and cash equivalents, and our capital structure was comprised of the following (please refer to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — 9. Debt”):
•$174 million of the available $200 million under the secured, revolving line of credit from our pre-delivery payment facility with Citibank (“PDP Financing Facility”);
•$15 million from our pre-purchased miles facility;
•$150 million in a secured loan with the Treasury;
•$66 million in unsecured loans as part of our participation in the payroll support program under the CARES Act; and
•$18 million under the floating rate building note.
Our Fares and the Choices We Offer 
We provide low-fare passenger airline service primarily to leisure travelers. Our low fares are designed to stimulate demand from price-sensitive travelers and consist of a base fare, plus taxes and governmental fees. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 our total revenue per passenger was $99.49, $111.23 and $109.91, respectively. 
We combine our low fares with flexible optional services for an additional cost. Such additional options include carry-on and checked baggage, advance seat selection, our extended-legroom Stretch seats, ticket changes and cancellations and refundability. Our bundled options include The Works, a hassle-free option that includes a guaranteed seat assignment, carry-on and checked baggage, ticket refundability and changes and priority boarding, all at an attractive low price and available only on our website, and The Perks, which enables customers to book the same amenities included in The Works, excluding refundability and ticket changes. We also promote and sell products in-flight to enhance the customer experience. We offer a convenient onboard payment system that enables customers to bundle products together to save money, make multiple purchases with a single credit card transaction and provide gratuities to our flight attendants. We reward our repeat customers through our Frontier Miles frequent flyer program and also offer our Discount Den membership program, which provides subscribers with exclusive access to some of our lowest fares. In addition to enhancing the customer experience, these offerings have helped us to increase our ancillary revenues from $12.80 per passenger in 2013 to $57.11 per passenger in 2019, $62.45 in 2020 and $60.55 in 2021. Our other revenues also include services such as our Frontier Miles affinity credit card program and commissions revenue from the sale of items such as rental cars and hotels. 
The following table represents our revenue, on a per-passenger basis for the periods presented: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 
Fare revenue per passenger | $ | 38.94 | | | $ | 48.78 | | $ | 52.80 
Ancillary revenue per passenger: | | | | | 
Non-fare passenger revenue per passenger | 57.65 | | 58.66 | | 54.33
Other revenue per passenger | 2.90 | | 3.79 | | 2.78 
Total ancillary revenue per passenger | 60.55 | | | 62.45 | | | 57.11
Total revenue per passenger | $ | 99.49 | | | $ | 111.23 | | $ | 109.91

Route Network 
The low unit cost, high quality of service and dependability that make Low Fares Done Right successful have enabled us to diversify our network across a wide range of leisure destinations as well as implement a network strategy that primarily targets high demand or underserved markets, where our low fares stimulate new traffic flows. 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we served approximately 120 airports throughout the United States and international destinations in the Americas. While our primary focus is to capture point-to-point demand on the 
nonstop routes that we serve, we also sell connecting itineraries, providing us with the opportunity to capture demand across a large number of routes beyond our nonstop footprint.
Below is a map of the destinations we serve as of our scheduled flights available for sale as of December 31, 2021: 
We use publicly available data related to existing traffic, fares and capacity in domestic markets, as well as other data sources, to identify growth opportunities. To monitor the profitability of each route, we analyze monthly profitability reports as well as actual and forecasted advanced bookings. We routinely make capacity adjustments within our network based on the financial performance of our markets, and we discontinue service in markets where we determine that long-term profitability is not likely to meet our expectations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we discontinued service to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and announced that service to Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Dulles International Airport (IAD) will discontinue in 2022. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges to the management of our network, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the recovery as a result of our broad current footprint and focus on leisure travel, where the U.S. airline industry has seen strongest domestic demand during the COVID-19 
pandemic. In 2022 and beyond, we plan to continue to strategically deploy our capacity where demand is highest during the recovery in order to increase our capacity metrics. 
Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record and reputation, codesharing relationships, and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities. Our competitors and potential competitors include legacy network carriers, LCCs, ULCCs and new entrant airlines. We typically compete in markets served by traditional network airlines, LCCs, the other U.S. ULCCs and regional airlines. 
Our principal competitors on domestic routes are American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines (which classifies itself as an LCC), which airlines are commonly referred to as the “Big Four” carriers, and Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, which together with JetBlue Airways, which classifies itself as an LCC, are commonly referred to as the “Middle Three” carriers. We also compete with the other U.S. ULCCs, Allegiant Travel Company and Spirit Airlines. There are also parties who have started new airlines, including Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways. With respect to the Big Four and Middle Three carriers, our principal competitive advantage is our low-cost structure, low base fares and our focus on the leisure traveler. We believe our low-cost structure allows us to price our fares at levels where we can be profitable while the Big Four and Middle Three airlines cannot. We believe the association of our brand with a high level of operational performance differentiates us from the other U.S. ULCCs and enables us to generate greater customer loyalty. 
The airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because, once a flight is scheduled, airlines incur only nominal incremental costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Price competition occurs on a route-by-route basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flyer initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize RASM. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell. A key element of our competitive strategy is to maintain very low unit costs in order to permit us to compete successfully in price-sensitive markets. 
Distribution 
We primarily sell our product through direct distribution channels, including via our website at www.flyfrontier.com, our mobile app and our call center with our website and mobile app serving as the primary platforms for ticket sales. Approximately 71%, 76%, and 73% of our total tickets sold for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, were sold directly to our customers through these distribution channels. Sales through our website and mobile app represent our low-cost distribution channels. 
We also offer the option to purchase tickets through third parties, such as travel agents who access us through Global Distribution Systems (“GDSs”), e.g., Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan, and select online travel agents (“OTAs”), e.g., Priceline and websites owned by Expedia, including Orbitz and Travelocity. Third-party channels represented approximately 29%, 24%, and 27% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We maintain a zero percent standard commission policy for travel agency bookings worldwide unless local regulations mandate that we pay a commission. We also have agreements with all the leading GDSs. GDSs provide flight schedules and pricing information and allow travel agents to electronically book a flight reservation without separately contacting our reservations facility. 
Marketing and Brand 
Our principal marketing message to our customers is our Low Fares Done Right strategy. Consistent with our ULCC business model, we use a simple marketing message to keep marketing costs low and we regularly offer promotional base fares of $29 or less. 
Our principal marketing tools are our proprietary email distribution list consisting of over 17 million email addresses, our Frontier Miles frequent flyer program and our Discount Den subscription service, as well as advertisements in online, radio and other channels. Our objective is to use our low prices, superior customer service, price-based promotions and creativity to produce viral marketing programs that are cost effective. 
Each of our aircraft features one of our widely-recognized animals on its tail and is named after such animal. We utilize these animals in several of our online marketing campaigns and on the novelty cards we distribute to children onboard. In 2019, we introduced an initiative to highlighting endangered species on our signature animal tails.
Our brand includes a focus on our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, including our position as “America’s Greenest Airline” as measured by fuel efficiency. Our fleet continues to be the most fuel-efficient of all major U.S. carriers when measured by ASMs per fuel gallon consumed, generating over 100 ASMs per gallon during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing our commitment to continued fuel efficiency as we grow. In addition, our headquarters is located in a LEED Certified building, which was designed to achieve energy savings, water efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. 
We spent approximately 5.3%, 6.2% and 5.2% of total revenues on marketing, brand and distribution during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Loyalty and Membership Programs 
Our Frontier Miles frequent flyer program includes a number of attractive customer benefits, including family pooling benefits and elite status levels (Elite50K and Elite100K). The Frontier Miles World Elite MasterCard is the primary vehicle whereby customers earn mileage credits and our frequent flyer program is geared specifically towards supporting adoption and continued use of the credit card. The credit card includes the ability to earn bonus mileage credits on Frontier and restaurant purchases. In addition, every card member who spends over a certain threshold on the card in any calendar year receives a Frontier voucher. 
Frontier Miles offers award travel on every flight without blackout dates. All award tickets are subject to redemption fees, which are waived for all Frontier Elite Members and certain other bookings in advance of travel dates. There are three types of travel awards: Value Award Tickets require the lowest mileage credits, Standard Award Tickets are more widely available at double the mileage credit requirement and the highest mileage credit requirement Last Seat Availability Award Tickets are exclusively available to Frontier Elite Members. The program also calculates a year-end status level, and mileage credits never expire as long as a customer earns mileage credits at least every six months. 
The Discount Den is an annual subscription-based service that allows members exclusive access to the lowest fares on offer and first access to seats when our selling schedule is extended. Members pay an annual fee to join the Discount Den. 
Customers 
We believe our product appeals to price-sensitive customers because we give them the choice to pay only for the products and services they want. In addition, we believe our product is particularly attractive to families, featuring popular animals on our aircraft tails, novelty cards for children and certain offers tailored for families including our Kids Fly Free program and a staff that is committed to our goal of providing excellent customer service. Overall, our business model is designed to deliver what we believe our customers want: low fares and a high-quality flight experience. While we are not focused on stimulating business travel, we believe our low fares do attract a significant number of small business travelers who may be more sensitive to travel costs.

Fleet 
We fly only Airbus A320 family aircraft, which provides us significant operational and cost advantages compared to airlines that operate multiple fleet types. Flight crews are entirely interchangeable across all of our aircraft, and maintenance, spare parts inventories and other operational support are highly simplified relative to more complex fleets. Due to this commonality among Airbus single-aisle aircraft, we can retain the benefits of a fleet composed of a single type of aircraft while still having the flexibility to match the capacity and range of the aircraft to the demands of each route. 
We retired the last of the A319 aircraft from our fleet during the year ended December 31, 2021, increasing the proportion of the larger and more fuel efficient A320neo family aircraft to 66% of our total fleet as of December 31, 2021. The A320neo family aircraft that we continue to place in service are expected to continue delivering approximately 15% improved fuel efficiency compared to the prior generation of A320ceo family aircraft. In addition, while our entire fleet features new and lightweight seats, which eliminate excess weight and reduce fuel consumption per seat, the seat density on the A320neo family aircraft is higher than the prior generation of A320ceo family aircraft. With the transition to the higher density aircraft, we increased our average seats per departure to 193 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The use of the A320neo family aircraft and our seating configuration, weight-saving tactics and baggage process have all contributed to our ability to continue to be the most fuel-efficient of all major U.S. carriers of significant size when measured by ASMs per fuel gallon consumed.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a fleet of 110 Airbus single-aisle aircraft, consisting of 16 A320ceos, 73 A320neos and 21 A321ceos. We won first place for North America's Youngest Aircraft Fleet Award for 2022 by ch-aviation, with an average aircraft age of approximately four years as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, all 110 aircraft in our fleet were financed under operating leases, and the operating leases for four, six, four, eight and twenty aircraft in our fleet were scheduled to terminate during 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. In certain circumstances, such operating leases may be extended. We intend to replace retired aircraft with A320neo family aircraft.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a firm purchase commitment with Airbus to acquire 234 A320neo family aircraft. Additionally, we had commitments with CFM International and Pratt & Whitney for 21 additional spare aircraft engines by the end of 2029. After the consideration of planned aircraft returns in addition to planned direct leasing arrangements, we expect to operate a fleet of 272 A320 family aircraft by the end of 2029, all powered by new engine technology. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Our firm fleet and engine commitments as of December 31, 2021 were comprised of the following aircraft: 
 | A320neo | A321neo | | Total Aircraft | Engines
Year Ending | | | | | 
2022 | 9 | | 5 | | 14 | 5 
2023 | — | | 21 | | 21 | 2 
2024 | — | | 24 | | 24 | 2 
2025 | 17 | | 13 | | 30 | 3 
2026 | 19 | | 22 | | 41 | 3 
Thereafter | 31 | | 73 | | 104 | 6 
Total | 76 | | 158 | | 234 | 21

During October 2019, we entered into an amendment to the previously existing master purchase agreement that allows us the option to convert 18 A320neo aircraft to A321XLR aircraft. This conversion right is available until December 31, 2022 and is not reflected in the table above as this option has not been exercised. 
10


During July 2021, we signed a letter of intent with two of our leasing partners to add ten additional A321neo aircraft through direct leases, with deliveries beginning in the second half of 2022 and continuing into the first half of 2023. As of December 31, 2021, we have entered into a signed direct lease agreement for seven of the additional aircraft, while the remaining three are covered under a non-binding letter of intent. None of these ten aircraft that will be acquired through direct leases are reflected in the table above given these are not committed purchase agreements.
In November 2021, we entered into an amendment with Airbus to add an additional 91 A321neo aircraft to the committed purchase agreement, which are expected to be delivered starting in 2023 and continuing through 2029, all of which are reflected in the table above. 
Aircraft Fuel 
Aircraft fuel is one of our largest expenses, representing 26%, 21% and 29% of our total operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had the most fuel-efficient fleet of all U.S. carriers of significant size when measured by ASMs per fuel gallon consumed. The price and availability of jet fuel are volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors as well as domestic and local supply factors. Our historical fuel consumption and costs were as follows: 
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019
Gallons consumed (millions) | 266 | | 162 | 289 
Average price per gallon | $ | 2.17 | | $ | 2.08 | $ | 2.22

Average price per gallon includes related fuel fees and taxes as well as effective fuel-hedging gains and losses. 
We have historically maintained an active hedging program designed to reduce our exposure to sudden, sharp increases in fuel prices. We regularly review our fuel hedging program and, accordingly, the specific hedging instruments we use, the amount of our future hedges and the time period covered by our hedge portfolio vary from time to time depending on our view of market conditions and other factors. Among the hedging instruments we have used in the past and may use in the future include swaps and collar contracts on jet fuel, fixed forward prices (“FFPs”), which allow us to lock in the price of jet fuel for specified quantities and at specified locations in future periods, and call options. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no fuel cash flow hedges for future fuel consumption, and fuel hedges therefore had no impact within our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include $82 million and $17 million in losses associated with fuel hedges, respectively. The losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily as a result of the precipitous decline in jet fuel prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which created a significant liability position at the settlement of our collar trades. These losses included $52 million relating to the de-designation of fuel hedges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on the fuel quantities where consumption was not deemed probable and resulting mark to market impacts. 
Maintenance and Repairs 
We have an FAA mandated and approved maintenance program, which is administered by our technical operations department. Our maintenance technicians undergo extensive initial and recurrent training. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component service. 
Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft. We categorize our line maintenance into four classes of stations, with each class categorized by the scope and complexity of work performed. The majority of and the most extensive line maintenance we and our specialist partners perform is conducted in Denver, Chicago, Cleveland, Orlando, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Philadelphia. 
Major airframe maintenance checks consist of a series of more complex tasks that can take from one to four weeks to accomplish and typically are required approximately every 24 months. Engine overhauls and engine performance restoration events are quite extensive and can take several months. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. In addition, prior to aircraft being returned to lessors, we will incur costs to restore these aircraft to the condition required by the terms of the underlying operating leases. Due to our relatively small fleet size and projected fleet growth, we believe contracting with third-party specialists for all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration and major part repair, is more economical than conducting these activities ourselves. We have entered into a long-term flight hour agreement for our engine overhaul services and an hour-by-hour basis agreement for component services. We also contract with third-party specialists for our heavy airframe maintenance. These contracts cover the majority of our aircraft component inventory acquisition, replacement and repairs, thereby eliminating the need to carry expensive spare parts inventory. 
We currently have a firm obligation to purchase 234 aircraft by the end of 2029. We expect that these new aircraft will require less maintenance when they are first placed in service (sometimes called a “maintenance holiday”) because the aircraft will benefit from manufacturer warranties and also will be able to operate for a significant period of time, generally measured in years, before the most expensive scheduled maintenance obligations, known as heavy maintenance, are required. Once these maintenance holidays expire, these aircraft will require more maintenance as they age and our maintenance and repair expenses for each of our aircraft will be incurred at approximately the same intervals. See Part I, Item IA. Risk Factors — “Our maintenance costs will increase over the near term, and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet.” 
Human Capital Resources 
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2021, we had 5,502 total employees, consisting of 1,709 pilots, 2,881 flight attendants, 121 aircraft technicians, 42 aircraft appearance agents, 39 flight dispatchers, 22 material specialists, 16 maintenance controllers and 672 employees in administrative roles. 
FAA regulations require pilots to have commercial licenses with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing.
We focus on hiring highly productive employees and, where feasible, designing systems and processes around automation and the utilization of third-party specialists in order to maintain our low-cost base. With respect to pilots, given the pilot shortage being experienced by parts of the industry, particularly regional airlines, one of our operational priorities is to maintain a robust pipeline of qualified pilot candidates. We intend to maintain our pipeline through the continuation of the recruiting and selection arrangements that we have entered into with several regional airlines that are not affiliated with any of the legacy network airlines. Under these mutual recruiting and selection arrangements, we jointly recruit, interview and select candidates to become Frontier pilots after successfully meeting defined training and flight experience requirements with one of the feeder regional airlines. We have found these arrangements to be beneficial to us because we are able to identify an attractive flow of pilot candidates and to be beneficial to the feeder regional airline because it is better able to recruit entry level pilots if it is able to offer those candidates an opportunity to graduate to a mainline airline, such as Frontier. In addition, under these arrangements, once we have selected a regional airline’s pilot for our career development program, the regional airline will not provide such pilot with an opportunity to participate in any similar programs with any other airline. Each of these arrangements is terminable at will by either party upon 60 days’ notice. In addition, we believe 
we are an attractive employer for pilots as a result of our strong growth, which provides our pilots with career progression opportunities and enables them to achieve substantial pay increases under the collective bargaining agreement. For example, as a result of our continuing fleet expansion, First Officers hired since late-2013 have been eligible for upgrade to Captain within 24 to 48 months of joining us. As of December 31, 2021, our median pilot and flight attendant seniority was approximately five and four years, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 88% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements. The table below sets forth our employee groups and status of the collective bargaining agreements with each as of December 31, 2021:
 | | | Percentage of Workforce
Employee Group | Representative | Amendable Date | December 31, 2021 
Pilots | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | January 2024 | 31% 
Flight Attendants | Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) | May 2024 | 52% 
Aircraft Technicians | International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) | March 2024 | 2% 
Aircraft Appearance | IBT | October 2023 | 1% 
Dispatchers | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | December 2021(1) | 1% 
Material Specialists | IBT | March 2022 | <1% 
Maintenance Control | IBT | October 2023 | <1% 

__________________
(1)In December 2021, our collective bargaining agreements with our dispatchers, represented by TWU, became amendable. Negotiations are set to begin in March 2022.
The United States Railway Labor Act (the “RLA”) governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (the “NMB”) to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even for a few years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”), may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another “cooling off” period of 30 days. At the end of a “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by the U.S. Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the dispatchers. In March 2017, the material specialists contract was ratified to include a new amendable date of March 2022. In October 2018, new five-year collective bargaining agreements were reached with the aircraft appearance agents and maintenance controllers, and in March 2019 a new five-year collective bargaining agreement was reached with the aircraft technicians. 
In March 2016 and July 2015, our collective bargaining agreements with our pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (“ALPA”), and our flight attendants, represented by AFA, respectively, became amendable. In December 2018, we and the pilots, represented by ALPA, reached a tentative agreement, which was subsequently approved by the pilots and became effective in January 2019. The agreement has a term of five years and includes a significant increase in the annual compensation of our pilots as well as a one-time ratification incentive payment to our pilots of $75 million plus applicable payroll taxes. We entered into NMB mediation with the union representing 
our flight attendants, AFA-CWA, in July 2017 and in March 2019 we reached a tentative agreement, which was ratified in May 2019.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities for all persons and prohibiting discrimination in all aspects of our operation. We believe that fostering an inclusive and diverse culture will add value and lead to a more highly engaged workforce, allowing us to deliver better business results. We have established Business Resource Groups — employee-led, voluntary organizations of people with similar interests, experiences, or demographic characteristics, including the Women’s Leadership Network, the Veterans’ Resource Group and the Green Leadership Group. We also partner with organizations such as the Latino Pilots Association, National Gay Pilot’s Association, Organization of Black Aviation Professionals, Women in Aviation and Rotary to Airline Group to help foster opportunities and careers in aviation. We honor and celebrate our differences throughout the year by recognizing meaningful achievements and shared stories through our company newsletters during Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Pride Month and Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
We are focused on creating an equitable workforce, considering diverse slates of candidates for all positions. The table below illustrates our employee diversity based on self-identification across all employees as of December 31, 2021: 
Male | Female | Minority
54% | 46% | 32% 

Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our employees and their families. We evaluate our benefit programs each year in terms of value of benefit offerings and out-of-pocket costs to ensure that they are competitive with the benefit offerings of other companies with whom we compete for talent. We continuously evaluate our benefit offerings through these market studies as well as annual employee surveys. In 2021 we implemented the Rally wellness program to incentivize employees to invest in their health, earn points and participate in various health and wellness competitions. Our compensation philosophy is continuously adjusted to better meet the needs of the marketplace and, in 2020, we improved our vacation offering for non-union employees.
COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have increased our focus on further strengthening our health and safety initiatives. We follow all federal, state and local protocols to help protect the health of our workforce and our customers. In March 2020, we implemented a COVID-19 pay protection policy to ensure employees took necessary time away from work to recover from COVID-19, provided an onsite vaccination clinic, and also provided free COVID-19 tests to many workgroups across our organization. We continue to require that facial coverings must be worn by all customers and team members throughout every flight.
In 2020 we introduced a fogging disinfectant to our already stringent aircraft cleaning and sanitation protocols, which provides a safe, certified disinfecting solution proven to be effective against viruses, including COVID-19. The fogging disinfectant is applied to virtually every surface in the passenger cabin. Planes are wiped down every night with additional disinfectant. During flights, main cabin air is a mix of fresh air drawn from outside the aircraft and air that has been passed through an air filtration system that features HEPA filters capable of capturing respiratory virus particles at more than 99.9% efficiency, similar to those used in hospital environments, with air exchange up to every three minutes.
Safety and Security 
We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We strive to comply with or exceed health and safety regulation standards. In pursuing these goals, we maintain an active aviation safety program and all of our personnel are expected to participate in the program and take an active role in the identification, reduction and elimination of hazards. 
Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch, and station operations. 
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (the “TSA”) is charged with aviation security for both airlines and airports. We maintain active, open lines of communication with the TSA at all of our locations to ensure proper standards for security of our personnel, customers, equipment and facilities are exercised throughout the operation. 
Insurance 
We maintain insurance policies we believe are of the types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties. Although we currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure you that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents. 
Foreign Ownership 
Under federal law and DOT policy, we must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and DOT policy currently require that at least 75% of our voting stock must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are U.S. citizens, as defined in in 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15), that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our board of directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. In addition, at least 51% of our total outstanding stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of our stock may be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into “open skies” air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. We believe we are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. 
Seasonality and Other Factors
The air transportation business and our route network are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for air travel tends to be higher in the second and third quarters as there is an increase in vacation travel, compared to the first and fourth quarters of the year.
Government Regulation 
Aviation Regulation 
The DOT and FAA have regulatory authority over air transportation in the United States. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international codesharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline’s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements 
between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier’s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government. 
The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement. Our international flights to Mexico are governed by a liberalized bilateral air transport agreement which the DOT has determined has all of the attributes of an “open skies” agreement. Our flights to the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Canada are governed by bilateral air transport agreements between the United States and such countries. Changes in U.S. aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of the corresponding air transport agreement, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our operations to/from these countries. 
The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAA air carrier certificate. 
International Regulation
All international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the foreign countries involved. If we decide to increase our routes to additional international destinations, we will be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT, and/or approvals from the FAA, as well as any applicable foreign government entity. In addition, we are required to comply with overfly regulations in countries that lay along our routes but which we do not serve. 
International service is also subject to Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), immigration and agriculture requirements and the requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. The CBP is charged with international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. regulations with respect to trade, customs and immigration. Like other airlines flying international routes, from time to time we may be subject to civil fines and penalties imposed by CBP if unmanifested or illegal cargo, such as illegal narcotics, is found on our aircraft. These fines and penalties, which in the case of narcotics are based upon the retail value of the seizure, may be substantial. We seek to cooperate actively with CBP and other U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies in investigating incidents or attempts to introduce illegal cargo.
In addition, foreign regulatory agencies located in jurisdictions we serve can impose requirements on various aspects of our business, including safety, marketing, ticket sales, staffing, and tax. We will continue to comply with all contagious disease requirements issued by the United States and foreign governments, but we cannot forecast what additional requirements may be imposed in the future. 
Airport Access 
In the United States, the FAA currently regulates the allocation of landing and takeoff authority, slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms which limit takeoffs and landings at three U.S. airports (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), and New York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and JFK International Airport (JFK)), two of which we serve (DCA and LGA). In addition, John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County, California and Long Beach Airport (LGB) in Long Beach, California, have a locally imposed slot system. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations. We currently have sufficient slots or operating authorizations to operate our existing flights, but there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in governmental regulations and policies. Our ability to retain slots or operating authorizations is subject to “use-or-lose” provisions of the governing regulations, and our ability to expand service at slot-controlled airports similarly is limited. The DOT also regulates slot transactions between airlines. 
Consumer Protection Regulation 
The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition including undisclosed display bias, lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, airline advertising and marketing practices, codeshare disclosure, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, consumer notices and disclosures, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, marketing agreements, codesharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.
In July 2021, the DOT issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NRPM”) requiring airlines to refund checked bag fees for delayed bags if they are not delivered to the passenger within a specified number of hours and refunding ancillary fees for services related to air travel that passengers did not receive. As of December 31, 2021, a final rule has not been issued.
In November 2021, the DOT reopened the comment period on an NPRM regarding short-term improvements to lavatory accessibility, including new proposed requirements for onboard wheelchairs. As of December 31, 2021, a final rule has not been issued.
The Biden administration issued an executive order mandating that masks be worn on commercial aircraft. This order was extended in December 2021 to at least March 2022. We will continue to follow all relevant guidelines and guidance to protect our guests and staff, but we cannot forecast what additional safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the extent of any pre-travel testing requirements that may be under consideration in the United States and that may be in place, or renewed, in any foreign jurisdiction we serve, including the effect of such requirements on passenger demand or the costs or revenue impact that would be associated with complying with such requirements.
Security Regulation 
The TSA and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S. International flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We believe we are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies. 
Environmental Regulation 
We are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as air emissions (including greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions), noise emissions, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the use, management, release, discharge and disposal of, and exposure to, materials and chemicals. 
In particular, in June 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) issued revised underground storage tank regulations that could affect airport fuel hydrant systems and reissued the Multi-Sector General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Industrial Activities. Among other revisions, the reissued permit incorporates the EPA’s previously issued Airport Deicing Effluent Limitation Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards. In addition, California adopted a revised State Industrial General Permit for Stormwater Discharges on April 1, 2014, which became effective July 1, 2015. This permit places additional reporting and monitoring requirements on permittees and requires implementation of mandatory best management practices. Cost estimates to comply with the above permitting requirements have not been defined, but we, along with other airlines, would share a portion of these costs at applicable airports. In addition to the EPA and state regulations, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of de-icing fluid to the environment, often by requiring airlines to 
participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport de-icing facilities. Such efforts are likely to impose additional costs and restrictions on airlines using those airports. 
We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us. 
GHG Emissions 
Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. In particular, in June 2015, the EPA announced a proposed endangerment finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. If the EPA makes a final, positive endangerment finding, the EPA is obligated under the Clean Air Act to set GHG emissions standards for aircraft. Several states are also considering or have adopted initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional cap-and-trade programs. On March 6, 2017, the International Civil Aviation Organization (the “ICAO”) adopted new carbon dioxide certification standards for new aircraft beginning in 2020. The new CO2 standards will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. In-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by 2028 will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are modified to meet the new standards. In January 2021, the EPA finalized GHG emission standards for new aircraft engines designed to implement the ICAO standards on the same timeframe contemplated by ICAO. Like the ICAO standards, the final EPA standards would not apply to engines on in-service aircraft. The final standards have been challenged by several states and environmental groups, and the Biden administration has announced plans to review these final standards along with others issued by the prior administration. The outcome of the legal challenge and administrative review cannot be predicted at this time. 
In the event that such legislation or regulation is enacted in the United States or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions where we operate or where we may operate in the future, it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. 
In addition, we are subject to the requirements of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), an international, market-based emissions reduction program adopted by ICAO in 2016. CORSIA is intended to achieve carbon-neutral growth in the international aviation sector from 2021 through 2035 by requiring airlines to compensate for the growth in CO2 emissions, relative to a predetermined baseline, of a significant majority of international flights through the purchase of carbon offsets or the use of low-carbon fuels. For each year from 2021 through 2029, CORSIA requires each airline to compensate for the rate of growth of the CO2 emissions of the aviation sector as a whole as determined by ICAO. Starting in 2030, CORSIA will require airlines to compensate for growth in CO2 emissions using a formula determined by ICAO that will combine the growth in aviation sector emissions and the growth in the individual airline’s emissions, with the proportion of the latter rising from at least 20% over the period 2030 through 2032 to at least 70% over the period 2033 through 2035.
ICAO originally defined the baseline as the average emissions from covered flights in 2019 and 2020. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, in June 2020 ICAO determined to remove 2020 from the baseline for the first few years of CORSIA implementation (2021-2023). Accordingly, we do not expect to be required to purchase offset credits over that period, unless the recovery in demand for international travel is unexpectedly strong and exceeds that of 2019 in those years.
At this time, the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain, primarily because of the difficulty in estimating the return of demand for international air travel in the recovery from the COVID-19 
18


pandemic. There is also significant uncertainty with respect to the future supply and price of carbon offset credits and sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuels that could allow us to reduce our emissions of CO2. In addition, as described above, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs because our compliance obligations through 2029 are based on the growth in emissions of the global aviation sector and begin to incorporate a factor for individual airline operator emissions growth starting in 2030.
U.S. commitments announced during the Biden administration’s April 2021 Leaders Summit on Climate include working with other countries on a vision toward reducing the aviation sector’s emissions in a manner consistent with the Biden administration’s 2050 net-zero emissions goal, continued participation in CORSIA and development of sustainable aviation fuels. On September 9, 2021, the Biden administration launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to scale up the production of sustainable aviation fuel, aiming to reduce GHG emissions from aviation by 20% by 2030 and to replace all traditional aviation fuel with sustainable aviation fuel by 2050. Whether these goals will be achieved and the potential impacts on our business cannot be predicted at this time.
Noise 
Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system, subject to FAA review under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act (“ANCA”) of 1990. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during take-off and initial climb and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread. 
Other Regulations 
Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the RLA. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations. 
Future Regulations 
The U.S. government and foreign governments may consider and adopt new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect our results of operations. We cannot predict what laws, regulations, interpretations and policies might be considered in the future, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. 
Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Our Business
Regulatory requirements, including but not limited to those discussed above, affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same in the future. For additional information, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “We are subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition,” “We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions, changing consumer preferences and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure,” “We are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA, the DOT, TSA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, compliance with which could cause us to incur increased costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition,” and “Changes in legislation, regulation and government policy have affected, and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business.”
