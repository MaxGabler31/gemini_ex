ITEM 1. | Business

General
We focus on providing cleaner, lower carbon transportation fuels. We are North America's largest producer of advanced biofuels. We utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an integrated value chain model designed to convert natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. During 2018, we sold 649 million total gallons of fuel (including fuel purchased from third parties for resale) and generated revenues of $2.4 billion. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, operating biorefineries, and distributing fuel through a network of terminals, positions us to serve the market for cleaner transportation fuels. In May 2018, we launched our latest innovation in diesel fuel, REG Ultra CleanTM Diesel. REG Ultra CleanTM Diesel is among the lowest emission diesel fuels on the market today.
Plant Network
We own and operate a network of 14 biorefineries. Twelve biorefineries are located in the United States and two in Germany. Twelve biorefineries produce traditional biodiesel, one produces renewable diesel (“RD”), and one is a fermentation facility. Our thirteen biomass-based diesel production facilities have an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 520 million gallons per year ("mmgy").
We own and operate the following facilities in North America:

We maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, for testing various feedstocks for conversion into biomass-based diesel and various new manufacturing processes for the production of biomass-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies and renewable chemicals. 
We produce renewable diesel at our Geismar, Louisiana facility. Renewable diesel generally carries a premium price compared to biodiesel as a result of a variety of factors including the ability to blend it with petroleum diesel seamlessly, better cold weather performance, and because it generates more RINs on a per gallon basis. We are evaluating long-term opportunities to further our ability to leverage our renewable diesel technology and expand renewable diesel production to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation fuels. For example, in October 2018, we announced a collaboration project with Phillips 66 on the possible construction of a large-scale renewable diesel plant in Washington state. The plant would utilize our propriety BioSynfining® technology for the production of renewable diesel fuel. We have not reached a definitive agreement with Phillips 66 with respect to this potential joint development project and there is no assurance that an agreement will be reached. We are also evaluating a large-scale expansion of our renewable diesel facility in Geismar, Louisiana.
Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs
We are a lower-cost, lower carbon biomass-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our biomass-based diesel from a wide variety of lower-cost, lower carbon feedstocks, including inedible corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce biomass-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil, which tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks in most of our facilities provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those that rely primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils.
We have the ability to adjust our processing in most of our facilities to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us a feedstock cost advantage over many other producers because we have the flexibility to respond to changes in feedstock pricing. In 2018, approximately 77% of our total feedstock usage was lower-cost inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or rendered animal fat feedstock. The remaining 23% consisted of refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 
We procure our feedstocks from numerous vendors in quantities ranging from truckload to railcar to water vessel to pipeline. There is no established futures market for the lower-cost feedstocks that we utilize. Inedible corn oil is typically purchased in forward positions of one to three months, and occasionally longer, on fixed priced contracts. We generally purchase used cooking oil and rendered animal fats on one to four week forward positions using fixed pricing or an indexed price compared to a published index such as USDA reports or recognized industry price reports such as The Jacobsen or Informa. Soybean and canola oils can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from a number of suppliers and pricing for these vegetable oils is compared to the broadly traded Soybean Oil Index of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation feedstocks, into high quality biomass-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate many new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available.
We procure methanol and chemical catalysts used in our production process such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These procurement contracts typically last from three months to one year. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price.
Distribution
We have established a national distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our biomass-based diesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access for supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Houston biorefinery has barge and deep-water ship loading capability. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customers’ biomass-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. Our distribution performance for 2018 is depicted below.
As of December 31, 2018, we leased over 1,100 railcars for transportation and leased biomass-based diesel storage tanks in 46 terminals. In general, the terminals where we lease our biomass-based diesel storage tanks are petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other biomass-based diesel customers can create a biomass-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal contracts typically have one- to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2018, REG sold products in 49 states in the U.S., six Canadian Provinces, and 19 other countries around the world.
In addition to biomass-based diesel, we also sell petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel, which enables us to offer additional biofuel blends to a broader customer base.  We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") at terminals throughout the northeastern U.S.  We sell additional biofuel blends at terminal locations in the Midwest, West Coast and Texas. We continue to look for terminal expansion opportunities across North America.
Government Programs Favoring Biomass-Based Diesel Production and Use
The biomass-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs.
Renewable Fuel Standard
Biomass-based diesel has historically been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel. The biomass-based diesel industry's growth has largely been the result of federal and state programs that require or incentivize production and use of biomass-based diesel, which allows biomass-based diesel to be priced competitively with petroleum-based diesel.
The Renewable Fuel Standard’s ("RFS2") biomass-based diesel requirement became effective in 2010, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Required volumes under the RFS2 program, referred to as the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"), are determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. The final RVO targets for the biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels volumes for the years 2015 to 2020 as set by the EPA are as follows:

 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 
Biomass-based diesel | 1.73 billion gallons | 1.90 billion gallons | 2.00 billion gallons | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.43 billion gallons
Total Advanced biofuels | 2.88 billion RINs* | 3.61 billion RINs* | 4.28 billion RINs* | 4.29 billion RINs* | 4.92 billion RINs* | N/A 

(* ethanol equivalent gallons)
The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and renewable diesel. RFS2’s total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels.
The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement.
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and renewable diesel typically has an EEV of 1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as “Obligated Parties” in the RFS2 regulations. Obligated Parties are required to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of renewable identification numbers ("RINs") from those who do. An Obligated Party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum refining companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron, Shell, Marathon and Citgo, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The EPA created the RIN system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of biomass-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of biomass-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including biomass-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction 
system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements.
The value of RINs is significant to the price of biomass-based diesel. In 2018, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the daily average B100 spot price, as reported by the Oil Pricing Information System, or OPIS, fluctuated significantly throughout the year and ranged from a low of $0.47 per gallon, or 16% of the average B100 spot price per gallon, in October to a high of $1.36 per gallon, or 43% of the average spot price, in February. 
Biodiesel Tax Credit
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, is not currently in effect, but has historically provided a $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against such biodiesel federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005, although on several occasions it has been allowed to lapse and then has been reinstated, in some cases on a retroactive basis, as described in the following table:
The BTC is an incentive shared across the biofuel production and distribution chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In February 2018, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2017, but was not reinstated for 2018. It is uncertain whether the BTC will be reinstated for 2018 or any later years.  
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits
The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, regulation is a rule designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a “carbon intensity” ("CI") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. 
We obtain CI credits when we sell qualified biomass-based diesel into California. During 2018, California CI credits ranged from $111.00 per metric ton to $200.50 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS. 
Other Government Programs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. The chart below summarizes some of the most significant programs.

Government | Program description 
Illinois | Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for biomass-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biomass-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2023. Illinois’ program has made that state one of the largest biomass-based diesel markets in the country 
Iowa | Iowa has a retailer’s incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2018 through 2024, retailers earn $0.035 per gallon of B5 - B10 and $0.055 per gallons for B11 and above. Iowa also has a biomass-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa recently enacted an increase in its excise tax on fuel, which is three cents per gallon less for B11 or higher blends than the diesel fuel tax. 
Texas | The biomass-based diesel portion of biomass-based diesel blends are exempt from Texas state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for B100. 
Minnesota | Minnesota law requires a B5 biodiesel blend except during the summer months when a B20 blend is required. 
Pennsylvania and Washington | These states have all adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at B2 with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. In addition, Washington State is in the process of developing legislation on a low carbon fuel programs. 
Oregon | The Oregon Clean Fuel Program requires a 10% reduction of the average carbon intensity of Oregon’s transportation fuels from 2015 levels by 2025. The baseline year for the program is 2015 and represents 10 percent ethanol blended with gasoline and 5 percent biodiesel blended with diesel. The Oregon Renewable Fuels Standard requires all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10 percent ethanol (E10). In addition, all diesel fuel sold in the state must be blended with at least 5 percent biodiesel (B5).
City of New York, Connecticut and Vermont | In October 2016, the City of New York adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends at a 5% rate for heating oil starting on October 1, 2017 and the blend level then moves to 10% in 2025, 15% in 2030 and 20% in 2034. Several northeast states, including Connecticut and Vermont, have adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends in home heating oil. 
Canada | While a number of provinces in Canada have biofuel programs (British Columbia has an LCFS, Alberta has a usage requirement, and Ontario has a usage requirement), the federal government is currently engaged in the rulemaking process on a nationwide Clean Fuel Standard, which may incorporate a number of carbon reducing policies. 

Although we believe that other government requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such regions, they may not increase overall demand in excess of RFS2 requirements. Rather, existing demand for our biofuel from Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to regions that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.
RED Program
The Renewable Energy Directive ("RED") in the European Union ("EU") establishes a 20% target by 2020 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in EU member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target is currently being achieved through biofuels.  EU member states produce yearly renewable energy action plans indicating their yearly national obligations for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector. These national obligations progressively increase every year until achieving the 10% target in 2020. Biofuels produced from certain types of feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from an extra incentive as these feedstocks count double towards the 20% target and towards the national obligations. In 2018, the EU institutions adopted the so-called RED II, which is valid during the period from 2021 to 2030 and provides additional incentives for biofuel produced from waste feedstocks and even opens new outlets such as marine fuels. 
Competition
We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, other biomass-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are biomass-based diesel and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we compete with independent biomass-based diesel producers as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, Louis Dreyfus Commodities Group and Ag Processing Inc. are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial, feedstock sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness 
competitors tend to make biodiesel from higher cost virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. We are also in competition with several large and well capitalized producers of renewable diesel. Neste Corporation has approximately 882 million gallons of renewable diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe, a significant portion of which is imported into the United States. It has recently announced its decision to expand its renewable products production capacity in Singapore. Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, a joint venture between Valero Energy Corporation and Darling Ingredients Inc., operates a 275 mmgy capacity renewable diesel facility and has announced plans to expand capacity to 675 mmgy by 2021. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with us, either by converting oil refineries to produce renewable diesel or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Several smaller petroleum refiners in the United States have effected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables in the past year and some of the largest refiners have reportedly started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. Competition from imported biodiesel changed significantly in 2018, when the International Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce imposed countervailing duties against unfairly subsidized biodiesel exports to the U.S. from Argentina and Indonesia. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA") data, biodiesel imports from Argentina decreased from 437 million gallons in 2016 to 280 million gallons in 2017 and no imports entered the U.S. since August 2017.  Biodiesel imports from Indonesia totaled 107 million gallons in 2016 and no imports have been reported since December 2016. However, renewable diesel imports from Singapore to the U.S have maintained a steady rate . Imports from Singapore totaled 223 million gallons in 2016, 189 million gallons in 2017, and is on pace for volume in 2018 similar to 2017 based on 11 months of data.
In our marketing and distribution operations, besides the integrated producers, we are also faced with competition from biomass-based diesel traders such as Lincoln Energy, NGL, BP, Shell, Vitol and others. The integrated producers and traders at times may have advantages because of logistics, feedstock accessibility and price, geographical location to customers, blending infrastructure, financial resources, and risk appetite for positions and/ or taking greater amounts of risk on a return of the blenders tax credit. These same trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant biomass-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well.
Risk Management
The prices for feedstocks and biomass-based diesel, including the value associated with government incentives, can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Lower-cost feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and biomass-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products.
In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise expands our view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energy to improve our risk management strategies.
Seasonality
Our operating results are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of and demand for biodiesel. Seasonal fluctuations may be based on both the weather and the status of both the BTC and RVO. 
Demand may be higher in the quarters leading up to the expiration of the BTC as customers seek to purchase biomass-based diesel when they can benefit from the agreed upon value sharing of the BTC with producers. This higher demand prompted by an expiring BTC has often resulted in reduced demand for biodiesel in the following quarter. In addition, RIN prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual RVO can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied.
Seasonal fluctuation in our business also occurs in the colder months when historically there has been reduced demand for biodiesel in northern and eastern United States markets, which are some of the primary markets in which we operate. Biodiesel typically has a higher cloud point than petroleum-based diesel or renewable diesel. The cloud point is the temperature below which a fuel exhibits a noticeable cloudiness and eventually gels, leading to fuel handling and performance problems for 
customers and suppliers. Reduced demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel may result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel. To mitigate some of these seasonal fluctuations in demand, we have upgraded our Newton and Danville biorefineries to produce distilled biodiesel which improves cold-weather performance.
History
Our predecessor, REG Biofuels, LLC, formerly named REG Biofuels Inc., which was formerly named Renewable Energy Group, Inc., was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 2006 upon acquiring the assets and operations of the biodiesel division of West Central Cooperative, or West Central, and two of West Central’s affiliated companies, InterWest, L.C. and REG, LLC. West Central is now known as Landus Cooperative. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 762 full-time employees in the U.S. and 88 international employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of U.S. and international patents and expect to file additional patent applications as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We have also developed trade secrets, and have licensed intellectual property related to our biomass-based diesel and industrial biotechnology businesses. We have developed a patented technology that uses microbes to convert sugars to biodiesel in a one-step fermentation process similar to ethanol manufacturing. Some of the patents issued to us do not expire until 2034 and additional patent applications in prosecution if issued will extend beyond 2034. 
Customer concentration
Our sales to one customer, Pilot Travel Centers LLC, or Pilot, were $219.2 million, $182.2 million and $144.8 million, representing approximately 9%, 8% and 8% of our total revenues for each of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our revenues from Pilot generally do not directly include the RINs associated with the gallons of biomass-based diesel sold. The value of those RINs represented approximately an additional 2%, 9% and 9% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on the OPIS average RIN price for the year.
