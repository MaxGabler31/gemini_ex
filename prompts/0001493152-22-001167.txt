ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History and Structure
 
Theralink Technologies, Inc., formerly OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”), was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology. On June 5, 2020, the Company acquired the assets (the “Asset Sale Transaction”) of Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation established in 2009 (“Avant”), pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 12, 2020 between the Company and Avant (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). Avant is a commercial-stage precision medicine and molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of patented, proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians and patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, in the areas of oncology.
 
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Avant and assumed certain of its liabilities. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Avant sold to the Company, all of Avant’s title and interest in, to and under all of the assets, properties and rights of every kind and nature, whether real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible (including goodwill), wherever located and whether existing or hereafter acquired, except for the specific excluded assets, which relate to, or are used or held for use in connection with, Avant’s business. The Company also hired Avant’s employees upon consummation of the Asset Sale Transaction. As consideration for the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company issued to Avant 1,000 shares of a newly created Series D-1 Preferred Stock which held 54.55% of all voting rights on an as-converted basis with the common stock. Upon the effectiveness of an increase of the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 6,666,667 shares to 12,000,000,000 shares, all such shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock issued to Avant automatically converted into 5,081,550,620 shares of the Company’s common stock. Avant possessed majority voting control of the Company immediately following the Asset Sale Transaction and controlled the Company’s Board of Directors after the termination of the ten-day waiting period required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Asset Sale Transaction was accounted for, in substance, as an asset acquisition of the Company’s net assets by Avant and a recapitalization of Avant. Avant is considered the historical registrant and the historical operations presented are those of Avant since Avant obtained 54.55% majority voting control of the Company. All share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes has been retrospectively adjusted for the recapitalization.
 
On June 5, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company; (i) entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Michael Ruxin to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and a director; (ii) entered into an employment agreement with Jeffery Busch to serve as the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and; (iii) appointed Yvonne Fors to its Board of Directors.
 
On August 14, 2020, the Board appointed Mr. Andrew Kucharchuk as Acting Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
 
On August 14, 2020, the Board approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from December 31 to September 30, effective immediately for the current fiscal year, and for all subsequent years until such time as the Board resolves to amend such fiscal year end. The fiscal year has been changed to conform to the September 30 fiscal year end of Avant which is the historical registrant as a result of the Asset Sale Transaction consummated on June 5, 2020 and therefore, no transition report is required.
 
On September 24, 2020, Andrew Kucharchuk resigned from his position as Acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kucharchuk continues to serve as a director on the Company’s Board of Directors. On the same day, the Company appointed Thomas E. Chilcott, III, to serve as the Chief Financial Officer.

Business Model
 
The Company is a commercial-stage, precision medicine, molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians, patients and biopharmaceutical companies, in the area of oncology. The Company’s near-term goal is to continue to commercialize the technology originally developed by Theranostics Health, Inc. This technology is differentiated due to:

● | An exclusive license agreement with George Mason University (“GMU”). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Having a patent portfolio licensed from GMU and the National Institute of Health (“NIH”). 
● | Having access to the Ph.D.’s at GMU who have done pioneering work in phosphoproteomic-based biomarker diagnostics and are well-published in this area. 
● | Expertise in cancer biomarker and data-generating laboratory testing data. 
● | Development of proprietary, cutting-edge assays focused on precision oncology care. 
● | Building revenue streams based on our proprietary technology Theralink. 

 
Theralink is advancing proprietary technology in the field of phosphoproteomic research, a sector which has emerged as one of the most exciting new components in the high-growth field of precision molecular diagnostics. The Theralink platform makes it possible to generate an accurate and comprehensive portrait of protein pathway activation in diseased cells from each patient, and thereby determine which individuals may be better responders to certain targeted molecular therapies. The platform enables the quantitative measurement of the level of activation. Moreover, the sensitivity is many times greater than conventional mass spectrometry and other protein immunoassays. Initially spun-out of GMU in 2006, and subsequently elevated to the federal government’s Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) standards, the diagnostics suite is highly relevant for oncology patient management today by helping to improve (i) chemotherapy drug selection; (ii) immunotherapy drug selection; and (iii) optimization of combination therapy selection.
 
The biomarker and data-generating tests provide biopharmaceutical companies, clinical scientists and physicians with molecular-based guidance as to which patients may benefit from new molecular targeted therapeutics being developed and used to treat various life-threatening oncology diseases. These tests may also provide guidance to physicians on existing treatment standards that are recognized as the standard of care in the oncology treatment community. This addresses the core aspect of precision treatment by identifying which individuals are more likely to respond to specific targeted molecular therapies, thus forming the basis for personalized medicine.
 
The technology is based upon the pioneering work of three noted scientists, Drs. Lance Liotta, Emanuel Petricoin and Virginia Espina, in proteomic-based diagnostics. Theralink benefits from a portfolio of intellectual property derived from licensing agreements with:
 

● | The US Public Health Service (“PHS”), the federal agency that supervises the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), which provides the Company with broad protection around its technology platform; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | GMU which provides access to additional intellectual property around improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures that form the basis for future diagnostic products. 

 
Theralink is committed to advancing the technology from GMU and the NIH as a platform for the development of new clinical biomarkers and diagnostics. These diagnostic and monitoring products have the potential to provide biopharmaceutical companies and doctors with critical molecular-based knowledge to potentially make the best therapeutic decisions based on a patient’s unique, individual medical needs.
 
Milestones
 
In the next 12 months, the Company intends to focus on completing key milestones to create value for both investors and the healthcare industry. These milestones include:

● | Establishing laboratory Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP’s”) to comply with New York, Washington, D.C., and Maryland CLIA, and the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) standards; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hire an Assistant Laboratory Director and additional lab techs and sales consultants; 
● | Choose members to sit on our Medical and Scientific Advisory Boards; 


● | Continue to validate additional Theralink cancer biomarker technology under CAP/CLIA standards to provide personalized medicine regarding treatment options for biopharmaceutical companies, clinical oncologists and their cancer patients; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Continue to partner with pharmaceutical companies to perform oncology-related data-generating testing services which generates additional revenues and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to seek financing to grow the Company. 

Market Overview
 
The Theralink technology focuses on the oncology discipline of molecular pathology. Within oncology, Theralink intends to initially focus on breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, gastrointestinal (“GI”) cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Within the clinical diagnostics space, Theralink aims to be a leading companion diagnostics provider by delivering assays that are intended to assist physicians when making pharmaceutical treatment decisions for a given patient.
 
For therapy selection, companion diagnostic results are intended to elucidate the efficacy of a specific drug or drug class for specific cohorts of patients within which a given patient is placed. Companion diagnostic companies are of particular interest to both drug development companies and physicians. Drug development companies benefit from the results of companion diagnostic assays by improving their accuracy in selecting patients for clinical trials who are most likely to benefit from the therapeutic they are developing. Physicians may benefit from improved decision-making information by allowing them to match a specific patient with the most effective treatment option. The basis of the effectiveness of companion diagnostic assays is built upon surrogate biomarkers, which are intended to measure the effect of a specific pharmaceutical treatment and its correlation to a biomarker, or endpoint. To aid in therapy selection, Theralink believes the most effective method is by taking a phosphoproteomic approach to tumor analysis.
 
Asset Description and Intellectual Property
 
Background
 
Theranostics Health was a privately held company founded in 2006. Its core technologies were focused on the quantitative measurement of proteins contained in the key signaling pathways of a disease.These measurements include pre-analytical processing of preclinical and clinical samples, Laser Capture Microdissection (“LCM”), and Reverse Phase Protein Array (“RPPA”). The application of the technology enables Theralink to work with both freshly frozen and formalin-preserved research and clinical samples.
 
LCM is used to isolate specific cell populations from the many different types of cells usually present in a clinical biopsy tissue sample. Therefore, information derived from subsequent molecular assays is specific to that targeted cell population. RPPA enables sensitive, quantitative, calibrated, multiplexed analysis of cellular proteins from a limited amount of starting materials, such as clinical specimens. Theranostics Health had an exclusive license from the NIH to commercialize LCM isolation of cells for the proteomic analysis used for cancer diagnostics and companion diagnostics of which Theralink now is the licensee.
 
Patent Portfolio
 
We have exclusively licensed 7 granted U.S. patents. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they were obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application.
GMU License Agreement
 
Our exclusive license agreement with GMU: (1) Grants an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Licensed Inventions to make, have made, import, use, market, offer for sale and sell products designed, manufactured, used and/or marketed for all fields and for all uses, subject to the exclusions discussed below; (2) Grants an exclusive option to license past, existing, or future inventions in the field of theranostics, from inventors that are obligated to assign to GMU and who have signed a memorandum of understanding acknowledging that developed intellectual property will be offered, subject to the exclusions discussed below; (3) The license and option granted specifically excludes biomarkers for lung, ovarian, and breast cancers in a diagnostic field of use and GMU inventions developed using materials obtained from third parties under agreements granting rights to inventions made using said materials; and (4) Grants right to assign or otherwise transfer license so long as such assignment or transfer is accompanied by a change of control transaction and GMU is given 14 days prior notice. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $50,000 to GMU as well as pay GMU (i) a quarterly royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by one and one-half percent (1.5%), due on a quarterly basis or (i) a quarterly sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by fifteen percent (15%). In addition, Theralink has the right of first refusal for all technology associated with RPPA technology from GMU.

-

NIH License Agreement
 
Our license agreement with the NIH grants an exclusive United States license. Under this agreement, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $6,000 to the NIH as well as a royalty equal to the net sales multiplied by three percent (3.0%) every June 30th and December 31st. In addition, a sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by ten percent (10%) will be payable upon sublicensing.
 
Regulatory Approvals – CAP/CLIA and FDA
 
Initially, the Company can provide data-generating services to certain counterparties such as biopharmaceutical companies for research use only (“RUO”). These counterparties will provide service revenues to the Company in the early years of its development.
 
The Company may expand its data-generating services to address a broader range of clients, specifically, either as a direct provider of diagnostic services to hospitals and chronic care providers for precision health screening by oncologists, or indirectly as a reference laboratory, thereby increasing potential diagnostic services revenues. The oncologists would eventually be using our data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, pancreatic cancer, GI cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients, among others.
 
The CLIA are federal regulations for United States based clinical laboratories to provide industry standards for testing human samples for diagnostic purposes. These amendments were added to the laboratory requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR 493. Three federal agencies are responsible for ensuring laboratories comply with CLIA standards: Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the CMS, and the Center for Disease Control.
 
Further, a laboratory can pursue a higher level of designation by becoming accredited by a recognized accreditation agency. The CAP is such an agency. The CAP releases its own requirements building upon CLIA’s regulations. Compliance is assessed by a peer group site inspection every two years. Meeting these criteria ensures that industry specific standards for laboratory operations are upheld in the lab. These requirements can point out areas for improvement to reach the highest level of quality.


Subsequently, if Theralink receives FDA approval as a companion diagnostic, the Company would consider expanding its data-generating services by opening additional laboratory sites to assist oncologists using precision therapy selection in hospitals and chronic care provider groups. These oncologists would be using the data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, pancreatic cancer, GI cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients once the Theralink assays are fully developed for these applications.
 
The attainment and timing of key regulatory approvals are critical and required to commence marketing and subsequent realization of revenues.
 
Goals for 2022 and Beyond
 

● | To attain reimbursement for our proprietary laboratory analyses (“PLA”) code for our Theralink assay, commence mass marketing: explore international partnerships and start to review potential opportunities in Canada, Asia and Europe; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase mass marketing and market share in all approved jurisdictions in 2022 and beyond 
● | Work closely with biopharmaceutical companies to have the Theralink® assay named as a companion diagnostic. 

Commercialization Strategy
 
Theralink is a micro-volume multi-marker tumor analysis platform that has been developed to improve upon the limitations of current techniques (such as western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS)) that produce low resolution information with modest gains in predictive power on which to base treatment plans. Theralink’s Next Generation Proteomics (NGP) may improve decision-making for biopharmaceutical companies, oncologists and patients because it recommends therapeutic options that may be optimal for a patient’s specific tumor. The Theralink proprietary micro-volume protein expression platform can potentially improve the management of over 800,000 cancer patients in the US alone based on figures provided by the American Cancer Society. It is anticipated that Theralink will be brought to CAP standards for breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, pancreatic cancer, GI cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in the future, and eventually for most solid tumor cancers, including possibly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
 
Theralink is applicable along the entire continuum of drug development: from discovery, to pre-clinical through to drug commercialization.

Research Use Only (“RUO”) Segment
 
For our RUO segment, the target customers fall into two main groups: those requiring discovery and early-stage drug development, and those requiring later stage drug development.

A. | For customers in the early-stage drug development, Theralink provides target identification and validation, model system validation (cells, xenografts), and optimization of compounds in specific absorption rate (SAR) studies. Because Theralink is able to directly measure the drug target, this allows customers to make smarter decisions regarding the efficacy of their drug, and whether to move forward or not, thus allowing them to reduce cost. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Theralink’s advantages over its potential competitors on the pre-clinical side include: 


● | The ability to measure multiple endpoints simultaneously (over 300) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flexibility in choice of endpoints (post-translational modifications) 
● | The ability to process different samples (cells, CSF, tissues, etc.) 
● | Sensitivity: nL sample, representing <2,000 cells 
● | Robust assays, reproducible, sensitivity, and specificity 
● | Calibration across experiments, direct comparison 


B. | For customers requiring later stage drug development, Theralink identifies markers for the customers to use in clinical validation, identifies pathway/marker sets with potential utility in the clinical setting, validates selected efficacy markers in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, identifies markers for patient stratification, and validates markers for future companion diagnostics. The value that Theralink provides these clients is to identify the appropriate individuals for the customer’s drug trials, i.e., those individuals that have the relevant activated pathways that make them most likely to be responsive to the drug. This will allow the customers to potentially reduce the size of their Phase III trials, allowing for a substantial cost and time savings. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Theralink’s advantages over its potential competitors on the clinical side include: 


● | First in class profiling of activated proteins in signaling pathways 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | One stop shop: from sample handling to LCM to data generation and final report 
● | Sensitivity allows use of small clinical biopsy (less than 30,000 cells). 
● | LCM allows purification of relevant cell populations 
● | Focusing directly on relevant drug targets (marketed molecular therapeutics) and potential drug targets (those in development) 
● | Identifying specific pathway signatures with focus on relevant nodes 
● | An advantage for combination therapy, high specificity on targeted pathway, monitor compensatory pathways, and activation through feedback signal 

CAP/CLIA Certified Laboratory Segment
 
Sample processing is via a single certified laboratory. Strategically, the data-generating services can be delivered at two distinct channels and are not mutually exclusive (i.e. can execute at one or both levels). The “direct sales” channel typically refers to marketing, sales and execution of sample processing and specific diagnostic services to the end-user as the hospital and chronic care provider for precision health screening by oncologists. The “reference laboratory” channel typically refers to providing a subcontract service to one or more counterparties (who have CAP/CLIA certification), so we are not direct to the end-user in this channel.
CLIA Approved Laboratory Segment
 
Sample processing may be through the certified laboratory that the Company manages. There is the “direct sales” channel (same as above). In addition, there is the “companion diagnostic” aspect to the end-user as the hospital and chronic care provider for precision health screening by oncologists that is specifically related to a drug’s indication and efficacy for the patient’s specific cancer biomarkers. Theralink’s involvement with biopharmaceutical companies in various stages of drug development and RUO projects could lead to the Company becoming a successful companion diagnostic for those treatments.
 
Our initial objective was to capitalize on successful pilots with biopharmaceutical companies and leading medical institutions in a clinical trial environment. Management accomplished this objective with the successful commercial launch of Theralink during Q1 2021. Now we plan to gain rapid adoption as a differentiated technology in the personalized healthcare marketplace by leveraging the strong support of the many key opinion leaders and users of the pilot platform.
 
Theralink, our flagship product for our commercial strategy, will focus on precision health screening for oncologists.

The key ingredients to our commercial success will be:
 

1) | A proprietary technology that provides a credible point of entry to a well-defined medical market; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Comprehensive protocols for cancer biomarkers positioned for seamless integration to established standards of care for oncologist treatment regimens; 
3) | Eventually, a data friendly format and HIPPA compliance for ease of integration to monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) modalities for oncologist teams to track precision diagnostics and monitor patient treatment outcomes. 


A. | Proprietary Technology for credible commercial point of entry 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Theralink’s focused technologies are of particular value to oncologist teams developing molecular targeted and/or combination therapies because of our ability to make very small and precise measurements in the cellular microenvironment. The platforms are based on assessing protein activation status (via post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, cleavage, etc.) of drug targets and receptors, their downstream signal transduction pathways, and potential compensatory or adaptive mechanisms within targeted cell populations. These commercial collaborations are critically important as they may establish our Company’s platform as a “must have” in specific cancers (e.g., breast cancer management), where precise and targeted chemotherapy, and immunotherapies can make a dramatic difference in patient outcomes. We intend to collaborate with top industry and medical institution oncology experts, and key opinion leaders (“KOL’s”), who are focused on developing precision oncology therapeutics.
 

B. | Strong pipeline of potential commercial partners 
---+-----------------------------------------------------

 
Theralink intends to deliver a comprehensive precision cancer biomarker platform by seamlessly integrating its technology into the workflow of oncologists in various healthcare networked systems. Currently, the oncology precision tumor analysis market is dominated by genomic diagnostic companies such as Genomic Health and Foundation Medicine. Theralink’s technologies provide a unique, complementary and actionable knowledge base to existing market players, seeking to improve outcomes for oncologists and their patients. Our targeted commercial partners are seeking technologies that help differentiate their approach to oncology care, by using patient-centric solutions to help enable better chronic patient management during and after treatment to help maximize patient outcomes and prevent recurrences. Theralink sees this as a major commercial opportunity to serve both hospitals and primary care providers in the US. These same hospitals and primary care providers may have connections to cancer treatment programs abroad (i.e. Europe and Asia).
 
Operations During the Year ended September 30, 2021
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company focused on executing its business plan by building out its new lab in Golden, CO and validating the equipment in order to meet CLIA and CAP standards. In addition, the Company’s management team has been actively marketing its Theralink assay to KOLs, channel partners, and cancer centers throughout the US. The new lab has a LCM area, with two new LCM machines, which will help the Company commercialize its proprietary data-generating technology for biopharmaceutical companies. The Company has also installed a tissue culture lab in addition to the main lab, which has two RPPA instruments and three auto-stainers which will help the Company commercialize its proprietary data-generating technology for new pharmaceutical clients. Management believes the Company’s new lab now has all of the instruments necessary to service biopharma clients with oncology-focused preclinical and clinical drug development programs. Arrangements have been made to obtain the necessary population data (additional cancer tumor samples) to help the Company continue to build Lab Developed Tests (“LDT”) for other cancers for clinical clients.


In addition to the build out of the new lab, the Company has hired an experienced staff to be able to service potential customers. It has done this by hiring (i) two Ph.D’s from the GMU Proteomics Lab (ii) a histologist who is an expert in CLIA/CAP regulations (iii) an experienced Senior Director of Business Development who has been instrumental in developing oncology and channel partner networks that the Company believes will be important in developing a strong cancer patient referral base, (iv) a board-certified Medical Director and two Associate Medical Directors (v) a knowledgeable Director of Oncology Commercial Markets, who will initially be responsible for reimbursement, coding and overseeing patient reporting (vi) a Director of Bioinformatics and (vii) a Senior Director of Commercial Biopharma markets.
 
Marketing and Pricing
 
To date, the Company had derived its revenues primarily from biopharma research and development contracts. These contracts require the Company to provide services directed towards specific objectives and include developmental milestones and deliverables. Up-front payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when milestones are achieved.

Market Opportunity
 
There are a number of key trends that are having a significant impact on the clinical testing business and represent opportunities for companies that can develop novel diagnostic tests. Clinical laboratory testing is an essential healthcare service and is being favorably impacted by the following:

● | Demographics: The growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increased testing: Physicians are increasingly relying on diagnostic testing to help identify disease risk, detect the symptoms of disease earlier, aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, monitor patient compliance and evaluate treatment results; 
● | Advances in science and technology: Recent medical advances have allowed earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases and continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in, and demand for, personalized or tailored medicine; 
● | Prevention and wellness: There is an increased awareness of the benefits of preventative medicine and wellness. Consumers, employers, health plans, and government agencies are increasingly focusing on detecting diseases earlier and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease. 

 
As a result of these significant changes in the laboratory testing market, it is evident that there is a significant commercial opportunity for companies that provide products or services that address the new needs of the evolving diagnostics marketplace. This is the market opportunity that the Company is addressing through its introduction of data-generating assays that use patented and proprietary technology to help improve patient health and help reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention, and treatment.
 
Our Strategy
 
The Company’s solution is to utilize the technology that it has exclusively licensed from GMU and the NIH to exploit the new opportunities that are evolving in the diagnostics industry, both for biopharmas and for oncologists and their patients. The Company was created to specifically commercialize reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays and services that are focused on determining the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time. These novel data-generating technologies are based on patented and proprietary technology that is well-suited to be run in a central or regional laboratory utilizing samples that are collected by healthcare providers and sent to the authorized CLIA certified testing facility for processing. This approach is similar to the business model that Foundation Medicine® has utilized (which was recently purchased by Roche for $5.3 billion) with its genomic assays. The Company will market data-generating assays that may be over 50% actionable for intended use by oncologists and may be used to potentially determine which FDA-approved or investigational drug may be most efficacious in each cancer. To achieve this goal of commercializing new data-generating opportunities, the Company is leveraging off the strategic relationships that have been established with organizations such as GMU and others to develop unique and high value-added data-generating assays.
Governmental Regulation
 
The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government health care programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 
Our clinical laboratory must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or (“CLIA”). CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. We received CLIA certification on August 28, 2020 for all states except California, New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Maryland. Those state’s CLIA certifications must be applied for separately.
 
In addition, CLIA requires certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if it performs testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Our laboratory will periodically test specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submit the results back to that organization for evaluation. If our laboratory would fail to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, it could lose its right to perform testing. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of our laboratories’ CLIA certification.
 

10
--


As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Our laboratory will also apply for accreditation by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization.
 
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. Our laboratory will be licensed by the appropriate state agency in Colorado. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we will be in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations when we become operational.
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
Although the FDA has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion by not otherwise regulating most LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA recently indicated that it is promulgating draft guidance for FDA regulation of most LDTs in the future.


HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.
 
On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013, through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”).
 
Under HITECH’s new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. Breach reports can lead to investigation and enforcement.
 
We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations, and we will maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorney generals who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the Company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.
 
In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all state and federal jurisdictions.

We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We will use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
International Regulations
 
We may market our assays outside of the United States and will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. On September 26, 2012, the European Commission released the first drafts of the new European Union (“EU”) regulations for medical devices and In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (“IVD”) that if finalized will impose additional regulatory requirements on IVDs used in the EU. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
Reimbursement and Billing
 
Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services are generally highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including Managed Care Organizations (“MCO”) and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include:

● | variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians; 
● | billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts; 
● | disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and 
● | disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement. 

 Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:
 

● | a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a governmental payor; or 
● | the patient. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
A variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments identified must be repaid to the Medicare program unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws
 
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statue is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.

Recognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.
 
Physician Self-Referral Bans
 
The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.
State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims
 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
Employees
 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company had sixteen active employees including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman. The Company has not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages and it considers relations with its employees to be good. No employee of the Company is covered by a collective-bargaining agreement.
