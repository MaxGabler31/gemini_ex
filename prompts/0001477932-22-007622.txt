Additionally, aircraft interior design incorporates lighter, flame-resistant polymer materials and engineered alloys for panels, seats and various components to reduce weight.

Advanced polymer materials with superior performance characteristics, including flame-resistance with non-toxic gases, have wide applicability in the construction industry. Plastic composite boards may be fabricated from a range of polymers, including polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyamide (PA), which are inherently water-resistant, and reinforced with a variety of materials, including cardboard fiber, fiberglass, wood or carbon, which provide increased mechanical strength. Additives, surface treatments and decorative finishes can further enhance the properties of the boards, which can be manufactured in standard sizes and become a replacement for gypsum and wood based structural panels such as drywall, plywood, OSB and MDF, and flooring. Plastic composite boards made from recycled plastics and fiber are considered green building products, not only because they decrease the amount of waste materials from landfills, but because they have insulating properties that can cut energy costs. When infused with a non-toxic flame retardant, these eco-friendly composite panels can be an effective passive fire protection system, providing superior safety and minimizing property damage from flame spread and smoke.

The construction industry is seeing an accelerating demand for sustainable building practices, which is expected to drive the market growth of green building materials, as well as promote the use of non-toxic chemicals, including flame retardants. Green building materials are an environmentally friendly solution because they are produced from safe, recyclable products, which help in conserving non-renewable resources and mitigating environmental and human health considerations. Moreover, green building materials have become a durable and energy-efficient solution that makes them suitable for various infrastructure applications. As part of a major rebuilding of aging infrastructure across the globe, investments in renovations and retrofit construction, including the replacement of decaying underground materials, often mandate the use of green materials and building methods. New construction of governmental buildings, office complexes, schools and residential structures is increasingly employing eco-friendly alternatives for insulation, concrete, wallboard and rebar, which often have similar or superior performance when compared with conventional materials. Several developing countries are launching programs with subsidies and incentives to spur growth in the market and spread awareness about alternative construction methods with the goal of supplying affordable and sustainable housing. In the U.S., LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used rating system for green building practices.
