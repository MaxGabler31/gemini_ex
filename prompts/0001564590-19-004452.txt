Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing biotech ingenuity to medical dermatology by delivering differentiated, new therapies to the millions of patients living with chronic skin conditions. We are committed to understanding the needs of both patients and physicians and using our insight to identify, develop and commercialize leading-edge medical dermatology products. Our approved treatment, QBREXZA™ (glycopyrronium) cloth (“QBREXZA”), is indicated for pediatric and adult patients (ages nine and older) with primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating). We are also evaluating lebrikizumab in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (a severe form of eczema) and have early-stage research and development programs in other areas of dermatology. We are headquartered in Menlo Park, California.
 We are focused on the development of therapeutic solutions in medical dermatology to treat skin conditions, such as hyperhidrosis and atopic dermatitis. These diseases impact millions of people worldwide and can have significant, multidimensional effects on patients’ quality of life, including their physical, functional and emotional well‑being. According to multiple published studies, patients report that medical dermatology conditions affect quality of life in ways comparable to other serious diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, asthma and arthritis.
 Our portfolio consists of:
  
• | QBREXZA, a topical, once-daily anticholinergic cloth that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in June 2018 for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a medical condition with no known cause that results in underarm sweating beyond what is needed for normal body temperature regulation. Anticholinergics are a class of pharmaceutical products that exert their effect by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that transmits signals within the nervous system that are responsible for the activation of sweat glands. QBREXZA is applied directly to the skin and is designed to block underarm sweat production by inhibiting sweat gland activation. We began shipping QBREXZA to wholesalers and a preferred dispensing partner (together, “Customers”) in September 2018, and QBREXZA became commercially available in pharmacies nationwide on October 1, 2018.

• | Lebrikizumab, a novel, injectable, humanized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin 13 (“IL-13”) that we are developing for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is thought to play an important role in promoting allergic inflammation and mediating its effects on bodily tissues, including in patients with atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab is designed to bind to IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/interleukin 4 (“IL-4”) receptor complex and subsequent signaling. In August 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”) pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other therapeutic indications. Based on the results of two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials conducted by Roche in atopic dermatitis patients, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial in January 2018 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy compared with placebo and to establish the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. We completed enrollment of 280 patients ages 18 years and older in the Phase 2b clinical trial in October 2018 and expect to announce topline results in the second half of March 2019.

Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize innovative and differentiated therapies that we believe can advance the standard of care for patients with dermatologic diseases. The key components of our strategy are to:

• | Commercialize QBREXZA and any other products for which we secure marketing approval. We are commercializing QBREXZA and currently plan to commercialize our other approved products, if any, in the United States by deploying a specialized sales force targeting primarily dermatologists, as well as other healthcare practitioners. We believe that we can compete effectively in the medical dermatology market by having our own sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations that provide high levels of customer support and scientific expertise to patients, dermatologists and other healthcare practitioners. We may partner with third parties to help us reach additional geographic markets or medical specialties. For example, we have granted an exclusive license to Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”) to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly develop our lebrikizumab product candidate. In our QBREXZA program, we produced positive Phase 2b clinical trial results within nine months of initiating our first clinical trial and positive Phase 3 clinical trial results within 10 months of initiating our Phase 3 clinical program. In our lebrikizumab program, we initiated our first clinical trial within five months of the closing of the Roche Agreement and completed patient enrollment in this clinical trial within nine months thereafter. We believe that our team’s expertise in designing and executing product development programs in medical dermatology will enable us to rapidly develop our lebrikizumab product candidate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficiently establish proof‑of‑concept for early‑stage product candidates and advance promising candidates into late‑stage development. In developing early‑stage product candidates, we focus on translating advances in the understanding of skin disease biology into innovative solutions for unmet needs in dermatology. We seek to rapidly and efficiently establish proof‑of‑concept for these product candidates. Using this approach, our experienced management team is able to efficiently determine whether and how to advance product candidates into the next stages of development, which we believe increases our ability to direct resources to promising programs and enhances our likelihood of successfully developing and commercializing our product candidates. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In‑license and acquire new products and product candidates. Since our founding in 2010, we have executed multiple transactions resulting in our existing portfolio. For example, in April 2013, we entered into agreements with Rose U LLC (“Rose U”) and Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a GSK company (“Stiefel”), to obtain rights to intellectual property related to our hyperhidrosis program. In August 2017, we entered into the Roche Agreement pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other therapeutic indications. We intend to continue to identify, evaluate, in‑license and acquire products and product candidates from various sources by leveraging the insights, network and experience of our management team. Our objective is to maintain a well‑balanced portfolio and leverage our development and commercial capabilities by in‑licensing or acquiring additional products and product candidates across various stages of development and commercialization.

• | Continue to build a team of committed, experienced employees and engage with patients and members of the dermatology community. We believe that the field of medical dermatology offers a unique opportunity to build relationships with medical practitioners, opinion leaders, patients and advocacy groups. We believe that consolidation in the medical dermatology industry has resulted in an enhanced opportunity for a medical dermatology‑focused company to build relationships with these stakeholders and has made available a large and growing talent pool of experienced employees who can make significant contributions to our company.

 QBREXZA
 Overview
 QBREXZA, a topical, once-daily anticholinergic cloth, was approved by the FDA in June 2018 for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a medical condition with no known cause that results in underarm sweating beyond what is needed for normal body temperature regulation. QBREXZA is applied directly to the skin and is designed to block underarm sweat production by inhibiting sweat gland activation. We began shipping QBREXZA to Customers in September 2018, and QBREXZA became commercially available in pharmacies nationwide on October 1, 2018. 
 In the body, sweat is produced by glands in the skin and released to the skin surface through ducts. Sweat gland activity is controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system transmits signals to the sweat glands through a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Anticholinergics are a class of pharmaceutical products that exert their effect by blocking the action of acetylcholine.
 Primary hyperhidrosis can affect the underarms, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, face and other areas. According to a study published in 2016, the prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is estimated to be 4.8% of the population, or approximately 15.3 million people. According to this study, 65% of hyperhidrosis sufferers in the United States have axillary hyperhidrosis. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that excessive sweating often impedes normal daily activities and can result in occupational, emotional, psychological, social and physical impairment. Studies also suggest that the negative impact caused by excessive sweating has been reported to be similar to, if not greater than, the negative impact caused by conditions such as psoriasis and other chronic diseases. There are very few approved treatments for hyperhidrosis, and the unmet medical need remains high.
 The market for products to control sweating is large and highly underpenetrated by prescription pharmaceutical products. Despite the limited efficacy of over‑the‑counter (“OTC”) antiperspirants for the alleviation of hyperhidrosis symptoms, according to the 2016 study, only about half of patients suffering from hyperhidrosis have discussed their condition with a healthcare professional (“HCP”). The reasons most commonly cited by hyperhidrosis sufferers for not discussing their excessive sweating with an HCP are lack of awareness that hyperhidrosis is a medical condition and belief that nothing can be done to treat their condition. Of those who do see an HCP about their excessive sweating, 53% were diagnosed with hyperhidrosis. In addition, patients may suffer from excessive sweating for years before seeking treatment. One study analyzing data from 1993‑2005 indicated that patients experienced an average duration of untreated symptoms of 8.9 years. We believe that this is largely a 
 6

result of the lack of effective, well‑tolerated and convenient prescription treatment options. For example, according to a survey of 398 axillary hyperhidrosis sufferers in the United States conducted by Dermira in July 2018 prior to the launch of QBREXZA, approximately two-thirds of those surveyed indicated they were not satisfied with the products they were currently using to treat their condition. Patients who seek treatment from a physician most commonly receive prescription topical antiperspirants. According to data provided by IQVIA NPA, these topical antiperspirants generated approximately 408,000 prescriptions in the United States in 2018. However, their use is limited by modest efficacy, particularly in patients with more severe disease and skin irritation. We believe that the market opportunity for a new, effective, well‑tolerated and self-administered prescription topical axillary hyperhidrosis treatment is substantially larger than the current market for prescription topical antiperspirants because such a therapy could further penetrate the segment of patients who seek treatment from a physician and encourage more patients to seek treatment. Prior to the availability of QBREXZA, therapeutic options for patients who are unsatisfied with topical antiperspirants are largely limited to more cumbersome or invasive strategies directed to blocking the activation of, destroying or removing the sweat glands by injectable, systemic, surgical or other means. These treatment options, which include injectable botulinum toxin (“Botox”) and off‑label use of oral anticholinergic agents, are often poorly tolerated and are used much less frequently than topical therapies. QBREXZA is the first and only FDA-approved once-daily, topical prescription treatment for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.
 Clinical Development
 Prior to FDA approval of QBREXZA, three Phase 2 clinical trials and three Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety were completed. The Phase 3 program comprised two pivotal clinical trials named ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 that were designed to assess the safety and efficacy of QBREXZA relative to vehicle and one clinical trial named ARIDO that was designed to assess the long-term safety of QBREXZA. 
 The ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Phase 3 trials were conducted in subjects with primary axillary hyperhidrosis and enrolled a total of 697 patients nine years of age or older. Inclusion criteria required that prior to the start of treatment, all subjects produce at least 50 mg of sweat in each axilla over a 5-minute period and rate the severity of their sweating daily over a week with a mean score of 4 or higher on the Axillary Sweating Daily Diary (“ASDD”) item #2, a patient reported outcome instrument scored from 0 (no sweating) to 10 (worst possible sweating). The median sweat production over 5 minutes at baseline was 122 mg in the QBREXZA arm and 113 mg in the vehicle arm in Trial 1, and 127 mg in the QBREXZA arm and 117 mg in the vehicle arm in Trial 2. The average weekly mean score on the ASDD item #2 at baseline was approximately 7.2 across both trials. 
 Subjects were randomized to receive either QBREXZA or vehicle applied once daily to each axilla. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects having at least a 4-point improvement from baseline in the weekly mean ASDD item #2 score at week 4 and the mean absolute change from baseline in gravimetrically measured sweat production at week 4.
 The results of ATMOS-1 (“Trial 1”) and ATMOS-2 (“Trial 2”) are presented in the table below:

Lebrikizumab
 Overview
 Lebrikizumab is our late-stage product candidate for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. IL-13 is a naturally occurring molecule that is thought to play a central role in promoting allergic inflammation and mediating its effects on bodily tissues, including in patients with atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab is designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent signaling, thereby inhibiting the biological effects of IL-13 in a targeted and efficient fashion. Roche has studied lebrikizumab in clinical trials involving more than 4,000 subjects across a range of conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients. In August 2017, we entered into a licensing agreement with Roche pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis and all other therapeutic indications.
 Atopic dermatitis is the most common and severe form of eczema, a chronic inflammatory condition that can present as early as childhood and continue into adulthood. It is estimated to affect 12% of children and 10% of adults. A complex disorder involving an interplay of immune system dysfunction, skin barrier compromise and environmental exposures, atopic dermatitis is characterized by dry, itchy, red, swollen and/or cracked skin, often accompanied by increased risk of infection, as well as intense, persistent itching that exacerbates skin barrier disruption and other clinical symptoms. Moderate-to-severe disease can cover much of the body and have a profound, negative impact on patients’ mental and physical functioning, limiting their sleep quality, activities and health-related quality of life.
 Atopic dermatitis is commonly treated with topical products, including moisturizing emollients, corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, as well as topical and oral antimicrobial therapies to manage skin infections and antihistamines to aid in the management of itch. Moderate-to-severe disease is often treated with systemic, immunomodulatory therapy, most commonly oral corticosteroids and less frequently other immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, which carry risks of well-documented side effects, including kidney, liver and blood toxicity, that require intensive monitoring by the prescribing physician during long-term use. In March 2017, Dupixent, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by binding to the IL-4 receptor subunit, became the first systemic therapy specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, offering a significant advance in treatment based on its efficacy and lack of systemic side effects associated with oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants.
 The introduction of new, targeted therapies, such as Dupixent, is projected to transform the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in much the same way that the advent of biologic therapies transformed the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis over the past 15 years. Prior to FDA approval of the first biologic therapy for psoriasis in 2003, moderate-to-severe psoriasis was treated with many of the same oral immunosuppressants used to treat atopic dermatitis today, with moderate efficacy and well-documented side effects. According to Decision Resources, since the FDA approved the first biologic therapy for psoriasis in 2003, and with the subsequent introduction of systemic, biologic and small-molecule therapies targeting a range of inflammatory mediators, the market for psoriasis therapies in the United States has grown approximately tenfold and is projected to total more than $13 billion in sales in 2025.
 In comparison with psoriasis, which Decision Resources estimates currently affects approximately 8.6 million people in the United States, of whom approximately 1.7 million suffer from moderate-to-severe disease, atopic dermatitis is estimated to affect 33 million people in the United States, of whom approximately 7 million suffer from moderate-to-severe disease. With the introduction of new, targeted therapies, such as Dupixent, Decision Resources estimates that sales of atopic dermatitis medications in the United States will grow from approximately $0.8 billion in 2016 to approximately $14.8 billion by 2025
. 
 IL-13 and Lebrikizumab.  IL-13 is thought to play a central role in promoting allergic inflammation and mediating its effects on bodily tissues in atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. Studies suggest that IL-13 contributes to many of the characteristic manifestations of atopic dermatitis, including skin barrier dysfunction, itch, infection and skin remodeling. In promoting allergic inflammation, IL-13 stimulates recruitment, activation and maturation of immune cells, including production of inflammatory mediators. In the skin, IL-13 is highly expressed 
 8

in atopic dermatitis lesions, where expression levels appear to correlate with lesion severity and chronicity. IL-13 mediates the effects of inflammation on skin tissue via several means. It is hypothesized that dysregulation of IL-13 disrupts the skin’s ability to serve as an effective barrier to environmental exposures, and it has been established that IL-13 down-regulates production of structural proteins that are important for maintenance of skin barrier integrity. In addition to its impact on skin barrier function, recent research has shown that IL-13 is a neuronal enhancer in multiple itch pathways and may be driving chronic itch in atopic dermatitis. IL-13 also suppresses immune responses to infectious microbes and stimulates collagen production and skin remodeling, suggesting it may contribute to the increased rate of infection and dysregulated skin tissue repair observed in atopic dermatitis patients. Blocking IL-13 has been shown to increase production of skin barrier proteins, reduce sensitivity to mediators of itch, enhance responses to infectious microbes, reduce tissue remodeling and reduce inflammation in preclinical models of atopic dermatitis. Successful treatment of atopic dermatitis normalizes both IL-13 expression and IL‑13‑mediated signaling. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in signs and symptoms in atopic dermatitis patients treated with monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-13.
 We believe that lebrikizumab may offer an attractive and differentiated approach to the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Based on the central role of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis and lebrikizumab’s unique molecular profile, combining a differentiated mechanism of action, high affinity for its target and robust pharmacokinetics, we believe targeting IL-13 with lebrikizumab presents an opportunity to deliver a therapy with a compelling combination of safety, tolerability, efficacy, convenience and ease of use to people living with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and the HCPs who care for them. Lebrikizumab is designed to bind IL-13 with high affinity, specifically preventing formation of the IL-13 receptor/IL-4 receptor complex and subsequent signaling, thereby inhibiting the biological effects of IL-13 in a targeted and efficient fashion. From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, whereas many antibodies that bind receptor proteins are rapidly cleared from the body following binding to their targets, lebrikizumab, like many antibodies that bind circulating proteins, such as IL-13, is cleared from the body more slowly, suggesting it could potentially be administered less frequently than other antibodies. Relative to other antibodies targeting IL-13, lebrikizumab has high affinity for its target, as well as a differentiated mechanism of action that does not involve inhibition of the binding of IL-13 to an alternate IL-13 receptor that serves as a natural regulator of IL-13 activity. Relative to small molecules, such as those that inhibit widespread cellular signaling proteins called janus kinases (“JAK inhibitors”), thereby broadly reducing the transmission of immune responses induced by a range of stimuli, evidence suggests targeted inhibition of IL-13 via monoclonal antibodies like lebrikizumab could result in a lower risk of side effects and associated clinical monitoring requirements, in addition to requiring substantially less frequent administration. As a result, we believe that lebrikizumab could be safer, better tolerated, more effective, more convenient and/or easier to use than Dupixent and many other products in development for atopic dermatitis.
 Roche studied lebrikizumab in clinical trials involving more than 4,000 subjects across a range of conditions, including two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients. In addition to the initial efficacy results generated in atopic dermatitis patients, we believe the substantial safety experience accumulated across the lebrikizumab program to date is supportive of the development of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. 
 Additionally, the potentially important role of IL-13 in mediating the effects of inflammation across multiple bodily tissues suggests that lebrikizumab may have applicability in conditions beyond atopic dermatitis. We intend to consider further investigating diseases in which inhibition of IL-13 can have potential therapeutic benefits for patients. 
 Clinical Development in Atopic Dermatitis
 Phase 2a Clinical Trials.  In addition to a number of studies in other potential indications, Roche has completed two exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating lebrikizumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.
 TREBLE Phase 2 Exploratory Clinical Study.  The TREBLE study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2, proof-of-concept study designed and conducted by Roche to assess the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab, administered via subcutaneous injection as add-on therapy to twice-daily topical corticosteroids (“TCS”) in 209 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Dosing in this study was largely based on 
 9

experience with lebrikizumab in asthma clinical trials and the objective of characterizing both dose-response relationships and dosing frequency requirements in atopic dermatitis.
 After two weeks of twice daily TCS therapy, patients in the TREBLE study were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either a single dose of 125 milligrams (“mg”) of lebrikizumab plus continued TCS (n=52), a single, 250-mg dose of lebrikizumab plus TCS (n=53), 125 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks (“q4w”) plus TCS (n=51), or placebo q4w plus TCS (n=53), for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 50% reduction from baseline in the 72-point clinical grading scale called the Eczema Area and Severity Index (“EASI-50”), an endpoint that has been widely used to measure treatment success in clinical atopic dermatitis trials, at the end of the 12-week treatment period. In addition, the time course of response to lebrikizumab treatment was assessed via a range of other measures, including EASI-50, as well as the proportion of patients achieving a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI score (“EASI-75”), the proportion of patients achieving a 90% reduction from baseline in EASI score (“EASI-90”), and the proportion of patients achieving clearing or near clearing of atopic dermatitis, as rated by the investigator on a five-point scale called the Investigator Global Assessment that ranges from zero, representing clear skin, to four, representing severe disease (“IGA0/1”). Inclusion criteria required that patients had an inadequate response to TCS and a regular emollient, and at both screening and the end of the initial two weeks of TCS treatment prior to the initiation of lebrikizumab treatment, had an EASI score of at least 14 and an IGA score of at least three.
 The results of the TREBLE study provided proof-of-concept for the treatment of atopic dermatitis with lebrikizumab, including information we believe that we can use to optimize the clinical profile of lebrikizumab in future clinical trials. Across a number of key efficacy measures employed in this study, lebrikizumab provided clinically meaningful placebo-corrected improvements, generally in a dose-dependent manner. These improvements were observed on top of intensive TCS application that was associated with substantial responses in the placebo group.
 Efficacy across Key Measures over 12 Weeks


P-values shown above are as of the end of the 12-week treatment period and represent comparisons to corresponding data in patients who received placebo only. P-values of less than 0.05 are denoted by *.
 After 12 weeks of treatment, relative to patients who received placebo, the group of patients who received 125 mg of lebrikizumab q4w achieved statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint, EASI-50 (82.4% vs. 62.3%, p=0.03). Improvements were also seen in the EASI-75 (54.9% vs. 34.0%, p=0.04) and EASI-90 (25.5% vs. 9.4%, p=0.03). The percentage of subjects achieving IGA0/1 was 33.3% in the 125 mg lebrikizumab group and 18.9% in the placebo group (p=0.10). In these patients, placebo-adjusted efficacy across these measures did not appear to plateau at the end of the 12-week treatment period, consistent with the fact that in the absence of a loading dose, circulating lebrikizumab concentrations likely did not reach a steady state during this period. While the groups of patients who received single, 125- or 250-mg doses of lebrikizumab generally did not achieve statistically significant improvements relative to those who received placebo after 12 weeks of observation in this study, results in these patients showed that placebo-adjusted effects on disease severity appeared to peak several weeks following the administration of a single lebrikizumab injection.
 10

We believe that the dose-response relationships observed across multiple endpoints, as well as trends toward improved efficacy with increasing dose and duration, suggest that increasing the dose and/or duration of repeated administration of lebrikizumab may result in improved efficacy in ongoing and future clinical atopic dermatitis trials, an effect that may be further improved by the introduction of a loading dose to achieve steady-state circulating lebrikizumab concentrations shortly after the start of therapy. Additionally, we believe that the time course of the responses observed in the TREBLE study, including following single doses of lebrikizumab, suggest that it may be feasible to administer lebrikizumab q4w, if not less frequently, in atopic dermatitis.
 ARBAN Phase 2 Exploratory Clinical Study.  ARBAN was an open-label study designed to assess the safety of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy, with an exploratory assessment of efficacy, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with lebrikizumab. 
 Safety and Tolerability.  Consistent with results observed across the lebrikizumab program to date, lebrikizumab was generally well-tolerated in these exploratory clinical studies in atopic dermatitis. There were no imbalances in the proportions of patients reporting adverse events, serious adverse events, events leading to discontinuation, or overall infections when comparing all lebrikizumab-treated patients with controls. Four patients (2.2%) in the lebrikizumab groups (all doses combined) and two control patients (2.5%) experienced an adverse event that led to withdrawal from the studies. Injection-site reactions occurred infrequently (in 1.2% of patients in all lebrikizumab groups and 1.3% of control patients).
 Phase 2b Clinical Program.  In January 2018, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2b dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as a monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Based on early clinical experience with lebrikizumab, the study is designed to build on the body of evidence supporting targeting of IL-13 in atopic dermatitis by evaluating three different dosing regimens, with the objective of optimizing the clinical profile of lebrikizumab and establishing the dosing regimen for a potential Phase 3 program. The study enrolled 280 patients ages 18 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the United States randomized in a 3:3:3:2 fashion as follows:
  
• | Group 1: A loading dose of 250 mg of lebrikizumab at week zero, followed by 125 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Group 2: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at week zero, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every four weeks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Group 3: A loading dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab at weeks zero and two, followed by 250 mg of lebrikizumab every two weeks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Group 4: Placebo at week zero and every two weeks thereafter.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change in the EASI score from baseline to week 16. Key secondary endpoints that will be evaluated during the 16-week treatment period include EASI-50, EASI-75 and EASI-90; the proportion of patients with an IGA score of zero (clear) or one (almost clear) and a reduction of two or more points (on a five-point scale) from baseline; and changes in pruritus (itch) and sleep loss and scores from baseline, both scored using 11-point numerical rating scales. Key inclusion criteria for patients enrolled in this study include chronic atopic dermatitis for at least one year, an EASI score of 16 or greater, an IGA score of three or four, and involvement of at least 10% of body surface area at screening and baseline. Following the end of the 16-week treatment period, patients will be followed for an additional 16 weeks.
 This Phase 2b clinical trial completed enrollment in October 2018 and we expect topline results in the second half of March 2019.

Research and Development Programs
 We continue to work on other compounds in early stages of development. In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) pursuant to which we acquired an option to license exclusive worldwide rights for three early-stage programs with undisclosed mechanisms of action as potential topical treatment options for dermatologic diseases. In December 2017, we acquired from Takeda an option to license exclusive worldwide rights for an additional early-stage program. If we exercise our option for any program, we would obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize selected compounds from that program and be solely responsible for further research, development and commercialization costs related to these compounds. In December 2018, we exercised our option with respect to one of the early-stage programs and obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize selected compounds from that program as potential topical treatment options for dermatologic diseases.
Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. While we believe that our development and commercialization experience, scientific knowledge and industry relationships provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop or market products or other novel therapies that are more effective, safer or less costly than our current or future product candidates, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are differentiated in relation to competing products.
 Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis
 QBREXZA competes with other therapies used for primary axillary hyperhidrosis, including:
  
• | Self‑Administered Treatments. Self‑administered treatments include OTC and prescription topical antiperspirants. Oral and compounded topical anticholinergics may also be used off‑label. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non‑Surgical Office‑Based Procedures. Office‑based procedures have been approved for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, including Botox intradermal injections marketed by Allergan plc (“Allergan”), and device-based treatments, such as MiraDry, a microwave treatment marketed by Miramar Labs, Inc., a subsidiary of Sientra, Inc., and PrecisionTx, a laser procedure from Cynosure, Inc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Surgical Treatments. Surgical treatments include techniques for the removal of sweat glands, such as excision, curettage and liposuction. Surgical procedures, such as endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, also are used to destroy nerves that transmit activating signals to sweat glands. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, there are several treatments under development that could potentially be approved and used to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis and compete with QBREXZA, including: energy-based devices from Candesant Biomedical, Inc., and Ulthera, Inc., a subsidiary of Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA; topical forms of botulinum toxin from Allergan and Eirion Therapeutics, Inc.; an injectable form of botulinum toxin from Medytox Inc.; topical anticholinergic product candidates from Brickell Biotech, Inc., Dr. August Wolff GmbH & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (“GSK”); and oral anticholinergic product candidates from Dermavant Sciences, Inc., a division of Roivant Sciences Ltd., and Atacama Therapeutics, Inc.

Atopic Dermatitis
 If approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, we anticipate that lebrikizumab would compete with other approved and marketed prescription atopic dermatitis products, including:
  
• | Injected Biologic Products. Dupixent, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”) and Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A. (“Sanofi”), is the only systemic therapy currently approved by the FDA specifically to treat atopic dermatitis. Monoclonal antibodies targeting other molecules, such as Xolair, a monoclonal antibody targeting immunoglobulin E marketed by Roche and Novartis AG (“Novartis”), may be used off-label. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Systemic Treatments. Other systemic treatments are prescribed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, including branded and generic oral corticosteroids, generic injectable and oral methotrexate products marketed by Sandoz International GmbH, a division of Novartis (“Sandoz”), Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (“Teva”) and Hospira, Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”); branded oral cyclosporine products such as Neoral, marketed by Novartis, and Gengraf, marketed by AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”); generic oral cyclosporine products marketed by Sandoz and IVAX Corporation, a subsidiary of Teva; branded oral mycophenolate products, such as CellCept, marketed by Roche, and Myfortic, marketed by Novartis; and generic oral mycophenolate products marketed by Mylan, Sandoz and Teva. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Therapies. Oral antibiotics and antihistamines are often used to manage comorbidities of atopic dermatitis, such as skin infections, and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, such as itch, respectively. There are also several prescriptions, non-prescription and OTC topical products utilized to treat atopic dermatitis, including Eucrisa, marketed by Pfizer, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors, as well as bath solutions and moisturizers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis treatments that are currently available for commercial use, there are several pharmaceutical product candidates that are under development and could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with lebrikizumab. Product candidates in Phase 3 development include tralokinumab from LEO Pharma A/S (“LEO Pharma”), baricitinib from Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”), PF‑04945842 from Pfizer and upadacitinib from AbbVie. There are also product candidates in earlier stages of development that could potentially be used to treat atopic dermatitis and compete with lebrikizumab, including products currently being developed by AbbVie; Asana Biosciences, LLC; AnaptysBio, Inc.; Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) and MedImmune, LLC, a division of AstraZeneca PLC; ASLAN Pharmaceuticals; Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a division of Roche, Galderma S.A., a division of Nestle Skin Health S.A., and Maruho; Suzhou Connect Biopharmaceuticals, Ltd., DS BioPharma Limited; Eli Lilly; Galapagos NV, MorphoSys AG and Novartis; GSK; Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited; Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.; Kymab Limited; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.; LEO Pharma; Menlo Therapeutics Inc.; Novartis; Pfizer; Regeneron and Sanofi; Roche; Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc., and XBiotech Inc.
 Commercial Operations
 We have built a commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of QBREXZA and the potential commercialization of additional products in the United States. We have built a sales force of over 100 sales representatives to establish relationships with dermatologists, as well as other healthcare practitioners and other prescribers. Our sales force is supported by our commercial group, including sales management, an internal marketing group, market access and payer efforts, and professional relations, as well as our separate medical affairs and supply chain management groups. In addition to our efforts with physicians, we are committing and will continue to commit financial and management resources to engage patients directly. To support our commercial infrastructure, we plan to continue to invest significant financial and management resources. We may also partner with third parties to help us reach other geographic markets or therapeutic specialties.
 For 2018, sales of QBREXA accounted for $3.0 million or 7.0% of our revenues, while in 2017 and 2016, all of our revenues were from collaboration and license agreements.

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and its foreign counterparts. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action.
 As of December 31, 2018, we own or have an exclusive license to 35 issued U.S. patents and 132 issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights that have been validated in various EU member states, and 10 pending U.S. patent applications and 79 pending foreign patent applications. 
 Issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, if issued, for our lead product candidates, glycopyrronium tosylate and lebrikizumab, will expire between 2020 and 2037.
 We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available.
 Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials.
 Collaboration and License Agreements
 Agreements with Rose U and Stiefel
 In April 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rose U pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know‑how and data related to our hyperhidrosis program. The license agreement with Rose U included a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel. In connection with the license agreement, we entered into a letter agreement with Stiefel pursuant to which we assumed Rose U’s obligation to pay Stiefel approximately $2.5 million in connection with the commercialization of products developed using the licensed data and to indemnify Stiefel for claims arising from the use, development or commercialization of products developed using the Stiefel data. The agreements require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products using the licensed patent rights, know‑how and data.
 14

As of December 31, 2018, we have paid license and other fees of $4.3 million to Rose U and Stiefel, including a $2.5 million payment in connection with the first commercial sale of QBREXZA, and are required to pay Rose U additional amounts totaling up to $0.6 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and other contingent payments. In addition, we are obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U or its assignee directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments. We are entitled to credit the $2.5 million milestone payment against current and future royalty payments owed to Rose U in accordance with the terms of the license agreement.
 We are permitted to grant sublicenses to the licensed rights and may assign the agreements upon an acquisition of us or our assets that relate to the license agreement, provided that in the event of an acquisition of our assets we must first pay to Stiefel the commercialization payment we are obligated to make on behalf of Rose U, if such amount has not already been paid. We may terminate the license agreement if Rose U experiences certain insolvency events or if Rose U commits a material breach of the license agreement, subject to applicable cure provisions. We may also terminate the license agreement if we determine that development results or market dynamics do not justify further development or commercialization of licensed products, in which case, all patent and technology rights shall revert to Rose U and we will (1) grant Rose U a perpetual nonexclusive license to any improvements owned by us related to the Rose U intellectual property that have been applied to or used with our hyperhidrosis program, at a royalty rate to be mutually agreed through good faith negotiation, and (2) for 120 days after such termination, assist and cooperate with Rose U (at Rose U’s expense) in connection with the license of such improvements to Rose U. Rose U may terminate the license in certain circumstances if we experience certain insolvency events or if we commit a material breach of the license agreement or if we cause Rose U to be in material breach of its license agreement with Stiefel, subject in each case to applicable cure provisions. Subject to earlier termination, the license agreement remains in effect until 15 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product have elapsed or, if later, the date that the last patent or patent application in the licensed patent rights has expired or been revoked, invalidated or abandoned. The last‑to‑expire issued patent that we licensed under the license agreement with Rose U expires in 2029.
 Agreements with Maruho
 In March 2013, we entered into a Right of First Negotiation Agreement with Maruho (“Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement”), pursuant to which we provided Maruho with certain information and the right to negotiate an exclusive license to develop and commercialize certain of our products in specified territories. In connection with the entry into this agreement, Maruho paid us $10.0 million (“Maruho Payment”), which will be credited against certain payments payable by Maruho to us if we enter into a license agreement for any of our products with Maruho. Maruho’s right of first negotiation expired in December 2016 but the right to credit the Maruho Payment against certain payments under any future license agreement for our products remains.
 In September 2016, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Maruho, which grants Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in Japan (“Maruho G.T. Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Maruho G.T. Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Maruho in October 2016 and are eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to $70.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones associated with submission and approval of a marketing application in Japan and certain sales thresholds, as well as royalty payments based on a percentage of net product sales in Japan. The Maruho G.T. Agreement further provides that Maruho will be responsible for funding all development and commercial costs for the program in Japan and, until such time, if any, as Maruho elects to establish its own source of supply of drug product, Maruho will purchase product supply from us for development and, if applicable, commercial purposes at cost. The Maruho G.T. Agreement is unrelated to, and the exclusive license of glycopyrronium tosylate in Japan to Maruho was not subject to the terms of, the Maruho Right of First Negotiation Agreement. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Maruho G.T. Agreement will remain in effect until the later of: (1) expiration or abandonment of the last valid claim of the applicable patent rights in Japan; (2) expiration of any market exclusivity in Japan granted by the applicable regulatory authority; and (3) 15 years following the date of the first commercial sale of the drug product in Japan.
 15

Agreement with Roche
 In August 2017, we entered into the Roche Agreement pursuant to which we obtained exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab, an injectable, humanized antibody targeting IL‑13, for atopic dermatitis and all other therapeutic indications. Unless earlier terminated, the Roche Agreement will remain in effect until no royalty or other payment obligations are or may become due.
 Under the terms of the Roche Agreement, we made an initial payment of $80.0 million to Roche in October 2017 and additional payments to Roche in 2018 totaling $55.0 million. We will also be obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, comprising $40.0 million upon the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical study, up to $210.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory and first commercial sale milestones in certain territories and up to $1.0 billion based on the achievement of certain thresholds for net sales of lebrikizumab for indications other than interstitial lung diseases. Upon regulatory approval, if obtained, we will make royalty payments representing percentages of net sales that range from the high single-digits to the high teens. Royalty payments will be made from the first commercial sale date in a country in such country and end on the later of the date that is (a) ten years after the date of the first commercial sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (b) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed compound patent rights, Dermira patent rights or joint patent rights in such country covering the use, manufacturing, import, offering for sale, or sale of lebrikizumab in such country, (c) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the applicable licensed non-compound patent rights in such country covering the use, import, offering for sale, or sale of the product in such country, or (d) the expiration of the last to expire regulatory exclusivity conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country for lebrikizumab.
 Collaboration with UCB
 In March 2014, we and UCB Pharma S.A. (“UCB”), entered into a Development and Commercialisation Agreement, dated March 21, 2014 (“UCB Agreement”), which provided that we would (a) develop Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) for the treatment of psoriasis in order for UCB to seek regulatory approval from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and the Canadian federal department for health, and (b) upon the grant of regulatory approval in the United States and Canada, promote sales of Cimzia to dermatologists and conduct related medical affairs activities in the United States and Canada. 
 The UCB Agreement also provided either party with the right to terminate the agreement under certain terms. We expressed our intent to terminate the UCB Agreement in accordance with its terms. As a result, we and UCB entered into an agreement on November 6, 2017, which, among other things, (a) terminated the UCB Agreement on February 15, 2018, (b) provided for the repurchase by UCB of all product rights, licenses and intellectual property relating to Cimzia, (c) specified the responsibilities and obligations of us and UCB in connection with the transition of certain activities under the UCB Agreement from us to UCB as a result of the termination of the UCB Agreement, (d) terminated UCB’s right to designate a director nominee to our board of directors and (e) provided for the resignation of UCB’s designee from our board of directors.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Drug Approval Process
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending NDA, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. As a result of these regulations, pharmaceutical product development and approval are very expensive and time consuming.
 16

Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well‑ controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre‑market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs and Biologic License Applications (“BLA”) for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. For dermatology products, Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. This permits the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug, should it ultimately be approved for marketing. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of an effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 After completion of the required activities, including clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States.
 The FDA also may refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. Advisory committee panels typically include clinicians and other experts to provide a recommendation as to whether the safety and efficacy of the product warrant approval for the proposed indication and patient population. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s good clinical practice requirements. Additionally, the FDA typically inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured, and may inspect the sponsor company and investigator sites that participated in the clinical trials. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the stated indication.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction following FDA review of a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 17

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or applicable supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA filed under section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA (“505(b)(2) NDA”), which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.
 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
 Biologics
 Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs and BLA supplements, including review timelines, are very similar to those for NDAs and NDA supplements, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks as other drugs.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post‑approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post‑approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, off‑label promotion, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post‑marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality‑control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality‑control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 18

Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration (i.e., that is subject to the Pediatric Research Equity Act) is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan that includes pediatric studies and associated timelines (if warranted). The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data for all pediatrics or specific age ranges or severities of disease.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six‑month extension of any exclusivity, patent or non‑patent, for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also encouraged to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, currently as part of FDA’s Clinical Data Summary Pilot Program. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of our programs.
Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries in which our clinical trials or commercial sales are conducted. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. Regulatory authorities in certain countries outside of the United States require the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority or via the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (“VHP”) which includes member states planned for participation in the clinical trial. The European Union CTA process also requires review and approval by an independent ethics committee. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with VHP and/or individual countries’ requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. This type of application is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, orphan (rare) diseases, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are highly innovative. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization from one state may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 19

Anti‑Kickback, False Claims Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among others, anti‑kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal healthcare program anti‑kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (“PPACA”), amended the intent element of the federal anti‑kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.
Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements
 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued a final rule pursuant to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, also known as section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. It requires medical product manufacturers to disclose to the CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians or teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting information on August 1, 2013, with the first reports due March 31, 2014. The reported data is posted in searchable form on a public website maintained by CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners and entities in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing‑related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 Reimbursement
 Sales of any of our product candidates that are approved will depend, in part, on how our products are managed by third‑party payers, such as commercial insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers and government health programs. Third‑party payers are responsible for managing overall pharmaceutical drug spending for their client membership and can employ a variety of means – including excluding a medicine from a formulary – to help control patient utilization. Third-party payers and their employer clients may also require patients to pay a high percentage of the list price of a medicine, which has been shown to negatively impact adherence to chronic medicines.
 Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the federal and state governments, and efforts to manage the prices of drugs have been a component of this effort. The U.S. federal government (including Congress), state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, demonstration of cost effectiveness versus standard of care with specified models, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for mandatory substitution of therapeutically similar generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results of operation. If any of our products are approved and these third‑party payers do not consider our approved products to be clinically superior or cost‑effective compared to therapeutically similar therapies, they may not cover our approved products in their formularies, or, if covered, the amount of patient cost-sharing could deter initiation and/or subsequent adherence, which would affect our net profitability.
 20

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D of the MMA, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand‑alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our approved products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers may follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies. Any denials in coverage or high beneficiary cost-sharing that results from the MMA may result in similar treatment from non‑governmental payers.
 The PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively “ACA”), enacted in March 2010, had a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured, while at the same time implementing measures to contain overall healthcare costs. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, which has not yet occurred. Moreover, although the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have indicated that they intend to not implement certain sections of the ACA and the current presidential administration and certain members of the majority of the U.S. Congress have sought to repeal all or part of the ACA and implement a replacement program. For example, the so-called “individual mandate” was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017, such that the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be eliminated beginning in 2019.
 In addition, in some non‑U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States, and prices in the European Union generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We use third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the production of all our clinical supply and commercial products. We do not have any in-house manufacturing facilities, and we plan to continue to rely on CMOs for our production needs for the foreseeable future. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight over the CMOs with which we contract. We have commercial and development contracts and quality agreements with all CMOs for the manufacturing of drug substances, drug products and finished goods. For QBREXZA, we are adding manufacturing capacity at our current CMOs as appropriate, and we are adding additional CMOs to our manufacturing network in anticipation of increased future commercial sales. We have mitigation plans in place to reduce the risk of supply interruption of QBREXZA, and we believe that we can support our commercial sales scenarios. However, the risks related to operating a global and virtual supply network remain, including but not limited to, risks related to regulatory action, labor disputes, single sources of supply and controlled temperature shipments.

Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, Roche is responsible for the manufacture and supply to us of lebrikizumab drug substance, and Roche has the right to transfer its drug substance manufacture and supply responsibilities to us at any time. In November 2018, Roche provided us with notice of its election to transfer its drug substance manufacture and supply responsibilities to us. Pursuant to the terms of the Roche Agreement, the transfer must be completed within five years after delivery of the election notice. We do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to supply, manufacture or distribute clinical or commercial quantities of lebrikizumab drug substance. We are working with Roche to identify and qualify a contract manufacturer to manufacture and supply the lebrikizumab drug substance. For lebrikizumab, we manage the drug product production and device assembly at CMOs. All of the production steps for lebrikizumab are single sourced.
 Failure of our CMOs to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects them to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 333 regular full‑time employees. From time to time, we also retain independent contractors to support our organization. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
