We are guided by our shared purpose to mobilize the future to create a better world and we are united by our culture of continuous improvement and bias for actions that embody the Vontier Business System (“VBS”). Through rigorous application of our proprietary VBS set of growth, lean, and leadership tools and processes, we continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of innovation, product development and commercialization, global supply chain, sales and marketing and leadership development. Our commitment to VBS and goal of creating long-term shareholder value has enabled us to drive customer satisfaction and profitability, significant improvements in innovation, growth and operating margins, and disciplined acquisitions to execute our strategy and expand our portfolio into new and attractive markets.
We market our products and services globally with $454.1 million of our 2021 sales coming from high-growth markets. We define high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing extended periods of accelerated growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure, which include Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific (with the exception of Japan and Australia).
In the mobility technologies market, we are a leading global provider of solutions and services focused on fuel dispensing, remote fuel management, point-of-sale and payment systems, environmental compliance, vehicle tracking and fleet management (“telematics”), and traffic management (“smart city solutions”), with products marketed under the Gilbarco, Veeder-Root, Orpak, DRB, Teletrac Navman and Global Traffic Technologies (“GTT”) brands. We serve our major markets with local manufacturing, sales, and service capabilities that offer tailored solutions for local customers based on their unique needs. With research and development for our mobility technologies products supporting our local presence in global markets, we deliver innovative solutions to customers around the world.
Through our Gilbarco, Veeder-Root and Orpak businesses, we serve owners and operators of retail fuel stations and convenience stores globally. We market a suite of products, software and services to improve safety, environmental compliance and efficiency across our customers’ forecourts, stores and fuel supply chains. We have a large installed customer base with pay-at-pump devices and convenience stores utilizing our point-of-sale technology globally. We believe our substantial scale and sophisticated technology offerings strategically position us to capitalize on key market trends, including increasing vehicle ownership and infrastructure buildout, particularly in high-growth markets where we believe we have significant opportunities to expand our customer base.
Through our DRB business, we primarily provide solutions to the car wash industry. We provide an end-to-end technology platform combining embedded point-of-sale, workflow and monitoring software, customer support, digital marketing and payment facilitation services. We serve individual customer sites and have long-standing relationships with the majority of the top 20 car wash platforms in North America. We believe that that DRB’s market leading integrated technology, superior reliability, high customer retention and unique business model position us well to capitalize on numerous paths for accelerated growth, including customer consolidation, continued shift from full service to express car washes, increasing adoption of workflow technology-as-a-service, shorter upgrade cycles, and water efficiency programs and usage restrictions.
Our telematics solutions are delivered as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) to commercial and government fleet operators to provide visibility into vehicle location, fuel usage, speed, mileage and other insights into their mobile workforce in order to improve safety and productivity. We believe that our differentiated technology and software solutions are positioned to benefit from increasing regulations worldwide governing driver safety, hours of service and recording and monitoring requirements.
Our smart city solutions focus on improving safety, travel times, fuel costs and on-time performance of public transit and emergency vehicles. Our solutions connect and communicate with intersections, vehicles and emergency/transit operating systems to monitor, assess and take real-time action to change traffic flow so that emergency and transit vehicles get to their destinations as quickly and safely as possible. We believe our smart city solutions help make cities safer and more livable by improving response times of emergency service vehicles and the efficiency of public transport.
We also deliver a broad set of vehicle repair tools and equipment for professional mechanics and technicians under the Matco, Ammco and Coats brands. Matco markets its products and services to automotive dealers, repair shops and fleet maintenance facilities through a network of franchised mobile distributors. Franchisees purchase vehicle repair tools, equipment and services from us and resell to end customers directly. To complement our offering of Matco vehicle repair tools, we have developed a SaaS suite of diagnostic tools and software to enhance repair shop workflow and strengthen relationships with our customers. We also generate sales from initial and recurring franchise fees as well as various financing programs that include installment sales to franchisees. We believe that Matco’s integrated workflow and diagnostic solutions are well positioned to capitalize on the increasing complexity of vehicles as advanced driver-assistance systems and other vehicle automation systems become prevalent.

Vontier Corporation is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2019 in connection with the separation of Vontier from Fortive Corporation (“Fortive” or “Former Parent”) on October 9, 2020, as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “Separation”). The Separation was effectuated through a pro-rata distribution on October 9, 2020, of 80.1% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Vontier Corporation to the holders of common stock of Fortive as of September 25, 2020. In January 2021, Fortive sold a total of 33.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock as part of a secondary offering. After the secondary offering Fortive no longer owned any of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Vontier” or the “Company” refer to either Vontier Corporation or to Vontier Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.
Reportable Segment
Vontier operates through one reportable segment comprised of two operating segments: (i) mobility technologies, which is a leading worldwide provider of solutions and services focused on fuel dispensing, remote fuel management, point-of-sale and payment systems, environmental compliance, telematics and smart city solutions, and (ii) diagnostics and repair technologies, which manufactures and distributes vehicle repair tools, toolboxes and automotive diagnostic equipment and software and a full line of wheel-service equipment. Given the interrelationships of the products, technologies and customers and the resulting similar long-term economic characteristics, we meet the aggregation criteria and have combined our two operating segments into a single reportable segment. Historically, these businesses had operated as part of Fortive Corporation’s Industrial Technologies reportable segment.

************************************
Research and Development
We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including electronic components, steel, plastics and other petroleum-based products, cast iron, aluminum and copper. Prices of oil and gas affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications or qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain, including in certain cases the use of safety stock, alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources.
During 2021, we experienced supply chain constraints related to certain raw materials, including semiconductors and electronic components, which contributed to the increase in our backlog. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license to be of material importance to any operating segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Competition 
We believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets. Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities. We face increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product and service line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in most of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our products and service lines but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular product or service line, and typically also include price, quality, performance, delivery speed, applications expertise, distribution channel access, service and support, technology and innovation, breadth of product, service and software offerings and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonal Nature of Business
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter and sales to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality.
Working Capital
We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors.
Backlog
Backlog includes unfilled orders and the annual average contract value of signed contracts for our SaaS product offerings. Backlog as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $733.9 million and $542.5 million, respectively. We expect that a majority of the unfilled orders as of December 31, 2021 will be delivered to customers within the first half of 2022. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog in 2021 is indicative of short-term sales performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term sales performance.
Human Capital Resources 
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, motivate, retain and develop the highest quality talent, united by a common culture in pursuit of continuous improvement. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, comprehensive benefit and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce and innovative culture; and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work. We seek to continue to attract, develop and retain world-class leaders and employees globally and to drive their engagement with our customer-centric approach.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 8,500 persons, of whom approximately 4,100 were employed in the United States and approximately 4,400 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 1,000 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. The Company believes that its relationship with employees is good.
Some examples of key programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, motivate, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:
•Inclusion, diversity and equity (ID&E). Our ID&E objectives are intended to build teams where employees feel empowered and able to be their authentic selves at work, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices.
◦Champion diverse recruiting and promotions, specifically for underrepresented employees and candidates;

◦Sponsor eight employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), including Allies for Inclusion, Asian Pacific Islander Network Alliance, Black Network, La Vida!, myAbilities, Pride, Veterans and Women’s Guild, that represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce. Our ERG’s have three pillars of focus; Development, Community and Recruiting. Our ERGs goals facilitate networking and connections with peers, outreach, mentoring, leadership and skill development;
◦Our CEO took two pledges; the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, and The Valuable 500.
•Health, wellness and family resources. The Company’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across businesses and geographies. Because we want our employees and their families to thrive, this year, we enhanced the ways we help our employees care for themselves and their families, especially in response to COVID-19
◦Paid all global employees for quarantine periods; 
◦Provided free mental and behavioral health resources to employees, including on-demand access to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for employees and their dependents.
•Talent Development. We prioritize and invest in creating opportunities to help employees grow and build their careers, through a multitude of training and development programs. These include online, instructor-led and on-the-job learning formats as well as executive talent and succession planning paired with an individualized development approach.
•Community & Social Impact. We are committed to providing comfort to those in need and opportunity to those who want to improve their world. One primary way we do this is through our unique employee connection programs – Vontier Cares and Day of Caring. Throughout the year, employees make a positive impact in their local communities through volunteering and other support. In 2021, over 2,000 Vontier employees around the world participated in Day of Caring initiatives supporting disaster and COVID-19 relief, education, and fighting hunger.
•Safety. Our robust safety program prioritizes employee safety and wellbeing across all workplace environments. Established risk control best practices are used, in conjunction with employee input and engagement to create a “beyond compliance” mindset that is under constant review. Systematic management systems either meet or are working towards internationally recognized ISO:45001 management system accreditation, and performance indicators that are biased towards proactive actions are used to measure progress.
Government Contracts
Although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2021 was from customers other than governmental entities, we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments and government-owned entities. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Regulatory Matters 
We face extensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products, software and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental Laws and Regulations
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, and workplace health and safety. For a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that our operations, products and services are subject to and other environmental contingencies, please refer to Note 17. Litigation and Contingencies to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws and risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Export/Import Compliance
We are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, such as:
•the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export, in-country transfer and re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that have both commercial and military or proliferation applications);
Table of Contents

•the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and
•the import regulations administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Other nations’ governments have implemented similar export/import control and economic sanction regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
International Operations
Our products and services are available in markets worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia Pacific. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target high-growth markets.
The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell directly from the United States into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors.
