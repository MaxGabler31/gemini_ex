Item 1: Business
Corporate Information

MMEX was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team led an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed in 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation in 2011 and then to MMEX Resources Corporation in 2016. Our mailing address is 3616 Far West Blvd #117-321, Austin, Texas 78731. Our physical office address is 3600 Dickinson, Fort Stockton, Texas 79735. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of April 30.
Company Overview

MMEX is focused on the development, financing, construction and operation of clean fuels infrastructure projects powered by renewable energy. We have formed two operating sub-divisions of the Company - one sub-division to transition from legacy refining transportation fuels by producing them as ultra clean fuels with carbon capture or as stand-alone renewable or clean fuels projects, and the second sub-division which plans to produce green and/or blue hydrogen with the option of hydrogen conversion to ammonia or methanol. These two sub-divisions will be operating respectively as Clean Energy Global, LLC and Hydrogen Global, LLC. The planned projects are designed to be powered by solar and wind renewable energy.

Our portfolio contains the following pipeline of planned projects:

Clean Energy Global, LLC

Project 1: Pecos Clean Fuels & Transport, LLC -Ultra Clean Fuels Refining-Pecos County, Texas

We have teamed with Polaris Engineering to develop an ultra-clean transportation fuel, up to 11,600 barrel per day feedrate crude oil refining facility at our Pecos County, Texas site to produce 87° gasoline, ultra-low sulphur diesel and low-sulphur fuel oil, utilizing the Polaris Ultra FuelsTM patented concept, which removes over 95% emissions of a standard refinery. Added to this patented process, the Company plans to incorporate carbon capture with the CO2 marketed to enhanced oil recovery projects in the area. We have signed the term sheet for the CO2 purchase with a super major international oil company and agreed to a proposal with the world’s largest U.S. utility for solar development. The Ultra FuelsTM concept, with capex and technical details completed in the Front-End Load-2 (“FEL-2”) study, features small size facilities to take advantage of proximity to smaller markets and/or locate directly near crude oil production areas near the Company’s owned 126-acre site. Because equipment is fabricated in modular units and shipped to site, this allows for an 18 month project completion time and more rapid implementation than traditional facilities. The smaller size and footprint, as well as lower emissions, also allows for faster permitting which we obtained for this facility from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality on February 18, 2022.

Project 2: Tierra del Fuego Province Argentina Gas Turbine Power Project. 

The Company has proposed with the Provincial Government of Tierra del Fuego (“Tierra del Fuego”) to supply two natural gas turbine packages with a rating of 12.9 MWe each with generator packages. The Company has a commercial and technical proposal with Siemens Energy, the manufacturer of these turbine and generators (the “Turbine Gen Sets”) for delivery to Tierra del Fuego. These turbine packages are designed to provide additional power in locations of Tierra del Fuego that have potential power shortages. The proposed financing of the project is to be supplied by Tierra del Fuego with a completion date of nine months from the notice to proceed. The Company will provide technical expertise along with that of Siemens Energy and Tierra del Fuego for instillation and conditioning of the Turbine Gen Sets designed with capability to switch over to 100% hydrogen fuel, as it potentially becomes available from the Company’s Green Hydrogen Project in Tierra del Fuego.
Project 3: Arroyo Cabral, Cordoba Province Argentina Solar Power Project.

The Company along with its international partners have entered a proposal with EPEC, the local utility in Cordoba Province to build potentially the Arroyo Cabral 48 MWe solar park for local power demand following the Company’s completion of a confidential information memorandum and pre-feasibility study for the project completed in June 2021. The local utility, EPEC, has proposed a Build Own Transfer structure with EPEC contributing 15% of the project costs as an equity contribution. The financing of the project potentially is to be provided by the Company’s international partners and other third parties.
Hydrogen Global, LLC

Project 4: Hydrogen Global- Pecos County, Texas- Green Hydrogen Project

This planned project to utilize the proprietary electrolyzer technology of Siemens Energy, a major international technology provider to the Company, plans to convert water to hydrogen through electrolysis. The facility will utilize solar power, with the Company’s water supply to produce up to 55 tons of hydrogen production per day. The Company and Siemens have completed the Front-End Engineering and Design (“FEED”) study in April 2022, which outlines the capex of the electrolyzer complex on the Company’s 321-acre site. The Company is in discussions with the same renewable power utility for the Ultra Fuels project to become the technology provider for 160 MWe solar power component. In addition, the Company is in discussions with two potential product off-takes (i) international partners to provide turn-key mobility markets to include hydrogen fueling stations and buses utilizing hydrogen fuel cells. The potential markets would be the major metropolitan areas in Texas to include Austin, Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio; (ii) with a technology provider for the Ammonia complex, for conversion of the hydrogen to ammonia to facilitate transportation of the finished product for marketing in the U.S. domestic ammonia market; and (ii) with international partners to provide turn-key hydrogen fueling stations and buses utilizing hydrogen fuel cells . The potential market would be the major metropolitan areas in Texas.
Project 5: Hydrogen Global- Tierra del Fuego Province Argentina-Green Hydrogen Project

On April 28, 2022, the Province of Tierra del Fuego and the Company announced the potential joint development of a green hydrogen project in the Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego area powered by wind energy. The Company has signed an amendment with Siemens Energy to adapt the Green H2 electroylzer FEED Study completed for Pecos County to this Project. In addition, the Company has a preliminary understanding with Siemens Gamesa as the technology provider for the wind energy. The Company estimates the land requirement of up to 10,000 hectares for the wind farm and the Green H2 facilities. The Company is in discussions with the same technology provider for the Ammonia complex as for Pecos County. The potential market for the Ammonia is Europe or Asia and the project location is ideal for ocean borne shipping east or west.

Project 6: Hydrogen Global- Tangier Morocco- Green Hydrogen Project

The Company has identified sea-based land assets in Tangier Morocco and is in negotiations for the supply of 160MWe of certified renewable power with local utility. The Company has international partners with local prescence in Morocco. Tangier has developed what is now the largest trading hub in Africa with ten major ports (https://www.marineinsight.com/know-more/10-major-ports-in-morocco/) including multi-modal deep seaports, multiple free-zones areas with substantial tax and trade incentives and it is located 15km from Europe ports (Spain and Gibraltar). Tangier and the neighboring coastal area benefit from some of the best wind conditions in the world, which can also be associated with solar power generation. The Kingdom of Morocco is strongly pushing the use of renewable energy and has recently issued a Green Hydrogen regulatory framework. The principal off-take markets are the shipping and terminal companies present in the Tangier Port Med including APM Terminals (https://www.apmterminals.com/en/medport-tangier/about/our-terminal), and CGM-CMA (https://www.cma-cgm.com).
Project 7: Hydrogen Global- Southern Coast of Peru-Green Hydrogen Project

The Company has entered advanced discussions with Peru’s principal electric power distribution company to develop potentially a Green Hydrogen project to produce up to 55 tons per day of hydrogen, requiring 160 MWe of constant and certified renewable power load. The Company plans to use its Siemens Energy Electrolyzer FEED template and adapt it for Peru. The Peru distribution company will also provide the land area as part of the transaction – approximately 5 hectares, by the sea to facilitate exports of green Hydrogen/Ammonia/Methanol to Asia and the U.S. West Coast. Peru’s mining industry with its use of heavy extraction and transportation equipment has significant market potential for the Company's hydrogen production.
Project 8: Hydrogen Global- Pecos County, Texas-Blue Hydrogen Project

The Company is in planning discussions with a super major oil company (the “Super Major”) to develop jointly a Blue Hydrogen project at the Company’s Pecos County, Texas site. The Project plans to utilize potentially a portion of the Super Major’s 2 billion cubic feet per day natural gas production and transportation from the area to produce hydrogen utilizing an autothermal reformer (“ATR”) technology along with carbon capture. In turn, the hydrogen will be used in Siemens Energy turbines and generator sets to produce 265 MWe of electric power which are projected to utilize initially a 75% hydrogen-25% natural gas feed and moving to a 100% hydrogen feed, with the electric power to be marketed by the power commodity trading desk of the Super Major. Solar and wind power will be utilized in the ATR and under discussions with the renewable utility developing the Company’s other solar projects in the area.

Completion of these projects is dependent upon our obtaining the necessary capital for planning, construction and start-up costs. There is no assurance that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms.

Energy Transition

We believe that the world’s energy consumers will need and demand legacy petroleum derived fuels such as ultra-low sulfur diesel and gasoline for an interim period that may last for the next 15 years as the electric transportation sectors and hydrogen markets evolve. Our mission is to help meet this demand by producing these transitional fuels in the most environmentally compatible way with rapidly permitted, greenfield modular smaller footprint refineries that reduce emission by over 95% and which employ carbon capture and to be powered by renewable energy.1 That has led the Company to join with Polaris Energy to employ its Ultra FuelsTM Refinery patented process. To this the patented configuration, the Company has added carbon capture and for the entire project to be powered with solar energy.

1 We note the following comment regarding new legacy large scale refinery capacity: “Oil companies will almost certainly never build another new refinery in the U.S., said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho. The last new U.S. refinery was built in the 1970s, and the industry now considers them too expensive, and burdensome to invest in due to strict environmental rules. Some are expanding capacity at existing facilities, but that process can’t easily be sped up, Mr. Yawger said.” Andrew Restuccia and Collin Eaton, “Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits”, https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-pushes-oil-companies-to-boost-capacity-criticizes-profits-11655297130?st=m4x22q74oti1m5f&reflink=article_email_share,  Wall Steet Journal, June 15, 2022.

This business plan underscores our decision to form two sub-divisions of the Company that will be operating respectively as Clean Energy Global, LLC and Hydrogen Global, LLC. The planned clean fuels and hydrogen projects are designed to be powered by solar and wind renewable energy. Our business plan of producing potential transitional clean fuels and hydrogen establishes our footprint in the current clean fuels demand and for the future clean fuels demand and most importantly, we can develop these concepts on a global basis.

Evolution of The New Hydrogen Economy

Last year in our 10K Item 1 Business, we outlined “The New Hydrogen Economy” and why we think the Company should make hydrogen the cornerstone of our future. Since passage of one year, the global hydrogen outlook has increased and evolved, and so has that of the Company. As noted, we are increasing our hydrogen footprint on a global scale with projects being developed in Texas, Argentina, Peru and Morocco.

Why hydrogen?

“After years of dabbling, major oil companies are finally planning the kind of large-scale investments that would make green hydrogen a serious business” reports Bloomberg.2 “They’re chasing a very particular vision of a low-carbon future — multibillion dollar developments that generate vast concentrations of renewable electricity and convert it into chemicals or clean fuels that can be shipped around the world to power trucks, ships or even airplanes.”3

“Hydrogen is a versatile and clean-burning fuel many believe could be the key to addressing some of the obstacles the global economy is facing in its race to decarbonize. Green hydrogen is an emission-free fuel produced using renewable energy that powers an electrolyzer to turn water into hydrogen and oxygen. Meanwhile, blue hydrogen is made from natural gas and can be emissions-free with carbon capture technology. Many believe that hydrogen could replace natural gas as a fuel for power plants and other industrial processes. The energy industry could utilize a significant portion of its existing infrastructure to transport and store hydrogen, which would flow into existing power plants to produce emissions-free electricity. Given the fuel's versatility, ability to utilize existing infrastructure, and carbon emissions profile, analysts see a bright future for hydrogen. For example, investment bank Goldman Sachs believes that hydrogen could be a $1 trillion a year market by 2050.” 4

Major green hydrogen investments have been announced by three international super major petroleum companies and a major utility in the past month.  On June 14, 2022, British Petroleum announced a $30 billion green hydrogen project in Australia5. Also on June 14, 2022, Total Energies announced an investment in India’s Adani to produce 1 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030. The first project to produce green hydrogen and related products will cost around $5 billion. Longer term, the project sponsors plan to invest more than $50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen and its ecosystem6 Chevron announced its $2.5 billion investment in hydrogen on June 16, 2022. 7

As noted by British Petroleum, the hub is one of a handful of hydrogen megaprojects attracting increasingly bigger investment, including from companies traditionally focused on fossil fuels. Hydrogen is emerging as a potential way to cut carbon emissions from industries such as trucking, shipping, steelmaking and fertilizer manufacturing that contribute to climate change but are hard to reduce8. 

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a catalyst for review of energy policy around the globe. Recent high natural-gas prices, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine, and Europe’s subsequent efforts to wean itself off Russian fossil fuels have accelerated government support for green hydrogen across the globe. Analysts and investors say the fuel is needed to supplement and ultimately supplant natural gas, including the liquefied form called LNG that countries in Europe and elsewhere are rushing to import. 9

Major power generation companies are joining the hydrogen evolution. On June 15, 2022, NextEra Energy, technology provider for MMEX West Texas projects, announced its RealZero goal to eliminate carbon emissions from number of its operations including its power generation facilities. 10 The Press Release stated: “NextEra Energy has created the Zero Carbon Blueprint™, a comprehensive plan to significantly increase renewable energy deployment and lead the $4 trillion market opportunity to decarbonize the U.S. economy. Plan would generate only carbon-emissions-free energy from a diverse mix of wind, solar, battery storage, nuclear, green hydrogen and other renewable sources. Real Zero is the most ambitious carbon emissions reduction goal ever set by an energy producer, and the sector's only one to not require carbon offsets for success.  Natural gas would be displaced by green hydrogen in some of its existing generating units: FPL would convert 16,000 MW of existing natural gas units to run on green hydrogen. The conversion of these modern, efficient units to green hydrogen is expected to be a cost-effective solution for customers and their operation would serve as an important and diverse generation source. Importantly, reaching FPL's Real Zero goal would not result in any stranded generation assets.”

RBN Energy analysis of the NextEra announcement stated “NextEra announced yesterday its Real Zero strategy, which envisions the company reaching full decarbonization by 2045. While the vision is multi-faceted, the plans for NextEra’s Florida Power and Light (FPL) subsidiary caught our attention. As part of Real Zero, FPL’s 16,000 megawatts (MW) of natural gas-powered electric generating capacity would be converted to run on 100% green hydrogen by 2045. How much hydrogen would that require, you may ask? The answer is, well, a lot. At 100% utilization and an assumed heat rate of 7.2 megawatt-hours per million British Thermal Units (MMBtus), we estimate the FPL gas plants can consume a peak rate of about 2,500,000 MMBtus per day, roughly 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. If all that natural gas were replaced by hydrogen, and assuming an equivalent heat rate for the power plants when burning H2, the hydrogen requirement of 2,500,000 MMBtus per day would require about 50,000 MW of electrolysis capacity to produce it. That is an enormous amount of electrolysis, the scale of which dwarfs anything we have heard of in the U.S., or the world, for that matter.”11

The forecasts for the hydrogen economy are robust. In a recent report, an international assurance and risk management company DNV forecasts the use of hydrogen in the energy transition through to 2050. The report states: 


· | “Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen is crucial for meeting the Paris Agreement goals to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. To meet the targets, hydrogen would need to meet around 15% of world energy demand by mid-century. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We forecast that global hydrogen uptake is very low and late relative to Paris Agreement requirements — reaching 0.5% of global final energy mix in 2030 and 5% in 2050, although the share of hydrogen in the energy mix of some world regions will be double these percentages.

· | Global spend on producing hydrogen for energy purposes from now until 2050 will be USD 6.8trn, with an additional USD 180bn spent on hydrogen pipelines and USD 530bn on building and operating ammonia terminals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Hydrogen will be transported by pipelines up to medium distances within and between countries, but almost never between continents. Ammonia is safer and more convenient to transport, e.g. by ship, and 59% of energy-related ammonia will be traded between regions by 2050.
· | Direct use of hydrogen will be dominated by the manufacturing sector, where it replaces coal and gas in high-temperature processes. These industries, such as iron and steel, are also where the uptake starts first, in the late 2020s. 
· | Hydrogen derivatives like ammonia, methanol and e-kerosene will play a key role in decarbonizing the heavy transport sector (aviation, maritime, and parts of trucking), but uptake only scales in the late 2030s.12 

The Company’s Hydrogen Initiatives-A Significant Global Footprint

The Company has initiated development of hydrogen projects in three of the top ten countries with hydrogen projects- U.S., Morocco and Argentina.

Management Expertise in Oil, Gas, Refining and Electric Power Project Development and Project Finance Development

MMEX management has over 30 years of experience in natural resource project development and project financing in North and South America and the U.K. In addition, MMEX directors and principal stockholders with oil, gas, refining and electric power experience will bring this expertise into the Company.

MMEX principals formed Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”) in 1986 to engage in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil & gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. Maple Resources and its principals have engaged in a number of oil and gas acquisitions and dispositions and ultimately acquired assets that included 10 gas processing plants and approximately 770 miles of natural gas gathering lines and transmission infrastructure. In 1992, Maple Resources sold substantially all of its existing US-based assets and began to pursue energy projects in Latin America, particularly in Peru through its affiliate The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru Ltd (“Maple Peru”). In 1993, Maple Peru began developing the Aguaytía Project, an integrated natural gas and electric power generation and transmission project. This US$273 million project involved the first commercial development of a natural gas field in Peru, as well as the construction and operation of approximately 175 miles of hydrocarbon pipelines, a gas processing plant, a fractionation facility, a 153 MW power plant and the related 392 km of electricity transmission lines. The Aguaytía Project began commercial operation in 1998. Maple Peru also acquired a 4,000-bpd refinery in Pucallpa along with 3 producing oil fields.

Jack Hanks, our President and CEO, is no longer engaged in the active business operations of Maple Peru and is able to devote substantially all of his business time to his duties on behalf of the Company. Further, we do not anticipate that Maple Resources will present any conflicts of interest for the MMEX principals in carrying out their responsibilities on behalf of the Company. 

Proposed Organizational Structure

The Company expects to operate its planned projects through subsidiaries.  The construction of the planned projects will require substantial equity and debt financing, far beyond the expected resources of the Company, and we anticipate that the subsidiaries will obtain equity and debt financing to finance the cost of construction. To the extent these subsidiaries raise money through the issuance of equity securities, our ownership in the subsidiaries will be diluted and our economic ownership of such entities may be a minority interest. As such, we will be entitled to only a portion of any future distributions made by these subsidiaries. In addition, while intend to retain managerial control of the subsidiaries, it is likely that equity investors will require representation on the board of managers in connection with their equity investments.

We anticipate these subsidiaries will be able to finance a majority of the total costs of the planned projects through debt financing, and the remaining portion of the total costs would be financed through equity investments. We intend to pursue the required debt financing from banks or other large institutional investors. Traditionally, such debt financing is in the form of project financing, which among other terms will require the project subsidiary to restrict its activities to the operation of the project financed by the lender, to pledge all assets of the project to the lender and to be subject to restrictive financial covenants. Such lenders further typically require engineering, marketing and feasibility studies as a condition precedent to the financing.  The Company will have to fund the cost of these reports and studies. 

Regulation

Although we do not believe our planned blue hydrogen and green hydrogen projects will have any significant environmental or ecological impact, we will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations relating to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the soil, groundwater, and surface water, and measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. There are risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations, such as releases of crude oil or hazardous substances from our pipelines or storage facilities. To the extent an event is not covered by our insurance policies, accidental releases could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 

We expect to file with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) for construction and operation permits.  We expect to employ carbon capture with the clean fuels and blue hydrogen facilities.  We are studying the options for sequestration for the CO2 in the various saline formations under our sites, which will require permits from the EPA or the Texas Railroad Commission (which, we understand, is in the process of seeking primacy for sequestration permitting).  

Our planned operations may also be subject to the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities, and to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and Transportation Worker Identification Credential program. If applicable, we will have to have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements, and we will need to develop a Facility Security Plan as required under the relevant law. We will also have to have in place procedures to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of all our facilities.

Our planned operations will also be subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We may also become subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We will take measures to ensure that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
