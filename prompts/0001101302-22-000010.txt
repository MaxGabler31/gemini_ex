Item 1. Business.
OUR COMPANY
Entegris, Inc. (“Entegris”, “the Company”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) is a leading supplier of advanced materials and process solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries. Our mission is to help our customers improve their productivity, performance and technology by providing enhanced materials and process solutions for the most advanced manufacturing environments. We leverage our unique breadth of capabilities to create mission-critical microcontamination control products, specialty chemicals and advanced materials handling solutions that maximize manufacturing yields, reduce manufacturing costs and enable higher device performance for our customers.
Semiconductors, or integrated circuits, are key components in the electronic devices that have changed the way we live, communicate and work. Products and applications like smartphones, 5G wireless technology, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, machine learning and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and virtual reality will increasingly require faster, more powerful and more energy efficient semiconductors and we believe will ultimately drive global chip demand. 
To meet the requirements for improved chip performance and density, semiconductor manufacturing processes have rapidly become increasingly complex by moving to smaller geometries, adopting new device architectures and utilizing new and innovative materials. These complex processes require new materials of ever-increasing purity, quality and stability to improve and maximize yields. We expect to benefit from these two intersecting themes of the growing importance of process materials and materials purity, and the impact they have on semiconductor performance, cost and reliability. We believe these trends are leading to increasing materials content per wafer and filtration opportunity per wafer, which are growth opportunities for us. 
Our customized materials solutions enable the highest levels of performance essential to the manufacture of semiconductors. As our customers introduce more complex architectures and search for new materials with better electrical and structural properties to improve the performance of their devices, they rely on Entegris as a trusted partner to address these challenges. We understand these challenges and have solutions to address them, such as our advanced deposition materials, implant gases, formulated cleaning chemistries and selective etch chemistries. Our customers also require greater end-to-end materials purity and integrity in their manufacturing processes that, when combined with smaller dimensions and more complex architectures, can be challenging to achieve. To enable the use of new metals and the further miniaturization of chips, and to maximize yield and increase long-term device reliability, we provide products such as our advanced liquid and gas filtration and purification products that help to selectively remove new classes of contaminants throughout the semiconductor supply chain. In addition, to ensure purity levels are maintained across the entire supply chain, from bulk manufacturing, to transportation to and delivery through a fab, to application onto the wafer, we provide high-purity packaging, fluid monitoring and materials handling products. 
Our business is organized and operated in three operating segments, which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. The Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials, or SCEM, segment provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases and materials, and safe and efficient delivery systems to support semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes. The Microcontamination Control, or MC, segment offers solutions to filter and purify critical liquid chemistries and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes and other high-technology industries. The Advanced Materials Handling, or AMH, segment develops solutions to monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical liquid chemistries, wafers and other substrates for a broad set of applications in the semiconductor industry, life sciences and other high-technology industries. While these segments have separate products and technical know-how, they share common business systems and processes, technology centers and strategic and technology roadmaps. With the technology, capabilities and complementary product portfolios from these three segments, we believe we are uniquely positioned to collaborate across divisions to create new, co-optimized and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. For example, our SCEM segment offers a highly selective nitride etch chemistry, our MC segment provides a liquid filter that is specifically matched to that formulation and our AMH segment ensures the integrity of the product as it is moved to and through the fab environment. 
We believe that our platform is differentiated and resilient for several reasons. First, approximately 69% of our revenue during 2021 was unit driven or recurring in nature, from products consumed as a result of the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our revenue is therefore generally more impacted by overall global semiconductor demand than the sales of semiconductor capital equipment. Second, our solutions are increasingly specified and tailored to meet our customers’ unique process conditions, and therefore switching away from our products may be costly and time consuming and may introduce risk to manufacturing yields. Third, our product portfolio is broad and not overly concentrated on any single product or product platform. As of December 31, 2021, we offered over 20,000 standard and customized products, and in 2021 no single product platform represented more than 4% of our net sales. Fourth, our customer base is diverse, and we are not overly dependent on 
any one single customer. Our customers are represented across the semiconductor supply chain, from chemical manufacturers, to equipment manufacturers, to semiconductor manufacturers. During 2021, only one customer accounted for over 10% of our net sales, while our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 43% of our net sales. Lastly, we believe our strong financial profile will allow us to invest in the research and development and advanced manufacturing capabilities necessary to maintain and expand our technology leadership and to drive organic growth. As we have done in the past, we expect to expand upon our product portfolio, increase our scale and strengthen our position as a leading supplier to our customers. 
In recent years, we have also sought to diversify outside of the semiconductor industry by taking advantage of our core capabilities in material science and material purity to provide critical products for the life sciences industry. During that time, we partnered with several leading companies in the life sciences industry to help guide our development efforts. In just a few short years, we brought to market our Aramus high-purity bag assemblies that are used in the production of biologics, including COVID-19 vaccines. Going forward we will seek to expand the use of these solutions into non-COVID biologics. In addition, we expect to provide ancillary solutions around our Aramus bags, and also plan to expand our filter offerings for bioprocessing applications. 
PROPOSED MERGER
On December 14, 2021, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the merger agreement, with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Yosemite Merger Sub, Inc, or merger sub, and CMC Materials, Inc., or CMC, a leading global supplier of consumable materials to semiconductor manufacturers and pipeline companies. Pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, upon completion of the transaction, merger sub will merge with and into CMC, with CMC surviving and continuing as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entegris. At the effective time of the proposed merger, each outstanding share of common stock of CMC (with certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement) will be converted into the right to receive $133.00 in cash and 0.4506 shares of common stock of Entegris, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of CMC approving the adoption of the merger agreement and the receipt of approvals under United States and certain foreign antitrust and competition laws. We have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the merger agreement and the effective time of the proposed merger, subject to specific exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, and have agreed to certain other customary restrictions on operations, as set forth in the merger agreement.
In connection with the proposed merger with CMC, we have entered into an amended and restated commitment letter with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and certain other financial institutions providing for a senior secured first lien term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4 billion and a senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $895 million. Commitments under the bridge facility will be reduced by, among other things, the aggregate gross cash proceeds in excess of $300 million resulting from any issuance or sale by Entegris of certain securities, including senior unsecured notes or other debt securities or other indebtedness for borrowed money, equity securities and equity-linked securities. 
THE SEMICONDUCTOR ECOSYSTEM
The manufacture of semiconductors requires hundreds of highly complex and sensitive manufacturing steps, during which a variety of materials are repeatedly applied to a silicon wafer to build integrated circuits on the wafer surface. We serve the semiconductor ecosystem by providing specialty materials and chemicals utilized in many process steps, offering a broad range of products to monitor, protect, transport and deliver these critical process materials during the manufacturing process and providing systems to purify liquid chemistry and gases throughout the manufacturing process. The areas of the semiconductor ecosystem that rely most heavily on our products and solutions are described below.
Etch and Resist Strip. During the etch process, specific areas of the thin film that have been deposited on the surface of a wafer are removed to leave a desired circuit pattern. After the etch process, the hardened resist needs to be completely removed, which requires the use of ultra-high purity chemicals of precise composition. In order to maintain manufacturing yields and avoid defective products, these chemicals must be maintained at very high purity levels without the presence of foreign material such as particles, ions or organic contaminants. Several of our products are utilized by semiconductor manufacturers during and after the etch process, including: 
•Formulated chemical solutions to remove photoresists and post-etch residues;
•Filters and purifiers, which help to ensure the purity of formulated cleaning chemistries and to achieve desired yields in the etch processing steps; and 
•Precision-engineered coatings to provide barriers to corrosive chemistries in the etch environment, protect surfaces from erosion and minimize particle generation.
In addition to being utilized throughout the etch process, semiconductor manufacturers require ultra-high purity chemicals of precise composition to clean wafers before and after several of the processes described below. Our proprietary formulated cleaning chemistries are used in these wet cleaning processes, and our liquid filters and purifiers ensure the purity of these chemicals.
Deposition. Deposition is a process during which certain materials are transferred to the surface of a wafer. Deposition processes include physical vapor deposition, or PVD, where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface in a low-pressure gas environment; chemical vapor deposition, or CVD, where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface by exposing it to one or more volatile precursors which react with the wafer surface; atomic-layer deposition, or ALD, where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface by exposing it to one or more precursors which react through a series of sequential, self-limiting reactions; and electro-plating, where a metal layer, such as copper, is deposited on a wafer surface using chemical baths. We provide products that are used during each of these deposition processes that are critical to enabling new device architectures, ensuring device performance and achieving the targeted manufacturing yields of semiconductor manufacturers, including: 
•Advanced precursor materials and electro-plating chemicals, which are utilized to meet the semiconductor industry’s composition, uniformity and thickness requirements of deposited films; and
•Filtration and purification products, which are used to remove contaminants during the deposition process, consequently reducing defects on wafers.
Photolithography. Photolithography is a process that uses light to print complex circuit patterns onto the wafer and is repeated many times throughout the semiconductor manufacturing process. To print the projected optical pattern, the wafer is coated with a thin film of light-sensitive material, called photoresist. Light is projected to expose the photoresist, which is then developed to create a stenciled image pattern. We offer products that semiconductor manufacturers use throughout the photolithography process, including:
•Liquid filtration and liquid packaging and dispense systems designed to ensure the pure, accurate and uniform dispense of photoresists onto the wafer, enabling manufacturers to achieve acceptable yields in the manufacturing process; and 
•Gas microcontamination control systems designed to eliminate airborne contaminants that often disrupt effective photolithography processes. 
Ion Implant. Ion implantation is a key technology for forming transistors and is used many times during semiconductor fabrication. During ion implantation, wafers are bombarded by a beam of electrically-charged ions which change the electrical properties of the exposed surface films. Those of our products that are used during the ion implant process include:
•Safe Delivery Source®, or SDS®, and Vacuum Actuated Cylinders, or VAC®, gas delivery systems designed to ensure the safe, effective and efficient delivery of the toxic gases necessary for the implant process; and 
•Electrostatic chucks and proprietary low temperature plasma coating processes for core components, which are critical elements of ion implantation equipment.
Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Chemical mechanical planarization, or CMP, is a polishing process used by semiconductor manufacturers to planarize, or flatten, many of the layers of material that have been deposited on silicon wafers. We offer a broad range of products used by semiconductor manufacturers during and immediately following the CMP process, including:
•CMP slurry products, which are used for polishing ultra-hard surface materials, including silicon carbide, or SiC, and gallium nitride, or GaN, substrates; 
•Formulated cleaning chemistries, which remove residue from wafer surfaces after the CMP process and prevent subsequent corrosion; 
•Filtration and purification solutions, which are used to remove select particles and contaminants from slurries and cleaning chemistries that can cause defects on a wafer’s surface;
•Roller brushes, which are used in conjunction with our formulated cleaning chemistries to clean the wafer after completion of the CMP process in order to prepare the wafer for subsequent operations; and 
•Pad conditioners, which are used to prepare the surface of the CMP polishing pad prior to every polishing cycle.
Wafer Solutions. Our wafer and reticle carriers are high-purity “micro-environments” that carry wafers between manufacturing process steps. These products protect wafers from damage or abrasion and minimize contamination during transportation and 
automated processing. Front-end wafer processing can involve hundreds of steps and take several weeks. Protection of the processed wafer between steps is essential, as a single batch of fully processed 200 mm or 300 mm wafers transported in one of our products can be worth over a million dollars. 
Chemical Containers. Semiconductor manufacturing and other high-technology manufacturing processes utilize large volumes of high-purity, corrosive and hazardous chemicals. We provide solutions for the handling of such chemicals, including: 
•Ultra-high purity chemical container products, such as drums, flexible packaging and associated coded connection systems, which are designed to maintain chemical purity, maximize utilization and ensure safe transport, containment and dispense of valuable, ultra-clean process fluids, from bulk chemical manufacturing to point-of-use in the manufacturing process; and 
•Ultra-pure valves, fittings, tubings and sensing and control products, which are used to distribute these chemicals around the fab and in wet process tools.
Other Markets. Many of the processes used to manufacture semiconductors are also used to manufacture flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices and light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, resulting in the need for similar filtration, purification, control and measurement capabilities. We seek to leverage our products, technologies, expertise and core capabilities to address these important market opportunities and pursue opportunities in certain life sciences applications.
INDUSTRY TRENDS
Emerging Applications. The market for semiconductors has grown significantly over the past few decades, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that smartphones (including 5G), the Internet of Things and emerging applications in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, high performance computing, autonomous vehicles and virtual reality will drive growth in the demand for semiconductors, drive wafer starts and create significant opportunities for our products. Existing applications in data processing, wireless communications, broadband infrastructure, personal computers, handheld electronic devices and other consumer electronics are also expected to drive demand for semiconductors, and in turn, our products, especially in light of the increased prevalence of work-from-home and remote learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For further information about our industries, see the “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the heading “The industries we serve are constantly evolving, and any failure to manage our business effectively during periods of rapid change may adversely affect our business performance and results of operations.”
Manufacturing Complexity and Architecture. The emerging applications described above require more powerful, faster and more energy-efficient semiconductors. Semiconductor architectures are changing, with transistor design increasing in complexity, the use of multilayered patterning (for example, extreme ultraviolet lithography), structures such as FinFET, 3D NAND and gate-all-around, and shrinking dimensions. These advanced architectures require more process steps, more novel materials and more sophisticated contamination control to manufacture semiconductors. We believe that demand for our materials and consumable products will benefit from the increase in process steps in lithography, deposition, CMP and etch and clean required to manufacture leading-edge semiconductors. 
Additionally, new materials have played a significant role in enabling improved device performance, and we expect this trend to continue. As dimensions get smaller, more novel materials will be required to enable transistor connectivity. For example, leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers are moving towards atomic layer scale, where the precision of the manufacturing process and purity of the materials used is vital to maintain device integrity. These materials need to be supplied and delivered at ever-increasing levels of purity and control, from point-of-production to point-of-dispense on the wafer. We expect the trend for new materials supplied at high levels of purity to drive demand for our advanced materials and our products and solutions designed to purify, monitor, protect, transport and deliver critical materials. To address the challenges related to advanced technology nodes, we collaborate with our customers to develop new materials, to enhance our filtration and purification capabilities and to introduce advanced materials packaging and monitoring capabilities.
Materials Handling Solutions. To minimize the potential for damage or degradation to their materials and to protect their investment in processed wafers, our semiconductor customers have become increasingly focused on materials handling solutions that enable them to safely store, handle, process and transport critical materials throughout the manufacturing process. We believe that this trend provides opportunities for us to utilize our breadth of capabilities to provide innovative materials management, purification, wafer transport and process solutions to semiconductor customers to enable them to successfully manage this growing complexity.
Reliance on Trusted Suppliers. Our customers require that their key materials suppliers demonstrate greater capabilities and efficiencies in their processes, including sustainability, scalability, flexible manufacturing, quality control, supply chain management and the ability to effectively collaborate on solutions to problems. We have responded to these demands by deploying resources in strategic locations to enable us to align with customer requirements and drive operational excellence. For example, in 2020 we continued to invest in our laboratory in Taiwan by adding key wafer processing and analytical equipment to support clean formulation development and advanced filter evaluations. To continue to accelerate the development cycle, we have focused on building models that simulate the performance of certain of our cleaning products. In China, during 2021 we continued to invest in our manufacturing capabilities and technical applications development. In addition, during 2021 in Taiwan we started construction on a new manufacturing and enhanced technology facility, which we expect will be our largest such facility in the world, adding significant scale in a key region. We believe that, as semiconductor manufacturers require greater capabilities of their supply partners, we will be able to leverage our manufacturing, operational and technical capabilities, along with our broad technology portfolio and expanding scale, to become an increasingly important strategic supplier to our customers.
Continued Consolidation. Our customer base within the semiconductor industry has consolidated in recent years through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, the importance of maintaining and developing strong and close relationships with our customers becomes even more essential. While continuing to strengthen these relationships, we also seek to further broaden our customer base by leveraging our products, technologies, expertise and core capabilities in serving semiconductor applications to address adjacent market opportunities, including in manufacturing processes for flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices, LEDs and products for life sciences applications. For further information, see the “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “A significant portion of our sales is concentrated on a limited number of key customers and our net sales and profitability may materially decline if we lost one or more of these customers.”
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
Strong Technology Portfolio. In the highly competitive semiconductor industry, manufacturers seek partners that are applications experts with broad technology portfolios to collaborate with from product conception to high volume manufacturing. To that end, we are committed to being able to provide our customers with innovative solutions for their manufacturing needs. For example, we have introduced sub-5 nanometer filtration products, advanced deposition materials for next generation transistor and interconnect technologies, advanced reticle pods for extreme ultra-violet, or EUV, photolithography applications, advanced 300 millimeter wafer carriers and advanced coatings to meet the rigorous demands related to the manufacturing of advanced technology nodes faced by our customers. Given the competitive nature of the semiconductor industry, we continuously seek to engage with leading logic and memory manufacturers to further advance their technology roadmaps.
To sustain our competitive advantage, in addition to being applications experts, we must develop, maintain and protect our critical intellectual property, including with patents, know-how and trade secrets. To add to our already robust patent portfolio that consisted of over 2,840 patents worldwide as of December 31, 2021, during 2021 we filed new patent applications across the globe covering inventions and technologies related to EUV, precursors, deposition materials, purification and filtration, micro-environments, delivery systems and life sciences.
Comprehensive and Diverse Product Offerings. As semiconductor manufacturers drive towards more advanced technology nodes, our customers seek suppliers that can provide a broad range of customized, reliable, flexible and cost-effective products and materials, as well as the technological and application design expertise necessary to enhance their productivity, quality and yield. We believe our comprehensive offering of materials and products creates a competitive advantage as it enables us to meet a broad range of customer needs and provide a single source of product offerings for semiconductor device and equipment manufacturers, which can often translate to shorter time-to-solution and time-to-market for our customers. Additionally, our broad product and solution portfolio allows us to serve many aspects of the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem and to create synergies among some of our products. For example, our highly selective nitride etch formulations used in 3D NAND applications have been co-developed with specifically functionalized filter membranes designed to ensure the highest process performance. Additionally, our sensing technology detects active components in the etch chemistry and allows customers to control the bath lifetime. Further, as the semiconductor industry looks to new metals for interconnect components, for example molybdenum and ruthenium, we believe our portfolio of deposition, clean, filtration and delivery products will become even more critical to enhancing our customers’ device performance and yield. 
To further strengthen and improve our product offerings, we are committed to significant investment in research and development initiatives, having spent approximately $167.6 million, $136.1 million and $121.1 million on such activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing 7.3%, 7.3% and 7.6% of our net sales, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our research and development expenditures have been increasingly directed towards innovation for advanced technology 
nodes, and in 2021, a significant portion of our research and development expenditures were focused at the leading edge. We plan to continue making substantial investments in research and development activities and expect our spending on such initiatives, as a percentage of revenue, to increase in the coming years. 
Global Infrastructure. Complementing our strong technology portfolio and diverse product offerings, we have a global infrastructure of design, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, service and technical support facilities to meet the needs of our global customers. For example, during 2021 we started construction on a new manufacturing and enhanced technology facility, which we expect will be our largest such facility in the world, in Taiwan. We expect that initial commissioning operations will begin in late 2022, with production ramping thereafter. The new Taiwan facility will add to various recent and ongoing expansions of and investments in our manufacturing operations and advanced technology centers in the United States, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea designed to increase our local manufacturing capacity and to support our customers in these regions, to be even more responsive to their emerging needs and to help accelerate their development cycles and product ramps. Further, we have established or acquired new facilities in China to serve the semiconductor and life sciences industries in that country, expanded our manufacturing capacity in Malaysia and expanded our presence in Singapore to enhance our global and regional management of supply chain and manufacturing processes. Finally, we have completed a number of new capacity and technology development investments and expansions in the United States to support our customers in the life sciences industry. For more information on our advanced manufacturing capabilities, see the “—Manufacturing” section below. We service our customer relationships in Asia, North America, Europe and the Middle East predominantly via direct sales and support personnel and to a lesser extent through selected independent sales representatives and distributors.
Our expansive global presence allows us to meet our customers where they operate, which has enabled us to build strong relationships with them. Our customers include logic and memory semiconductor manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and semiconductor materials suppliers. These customer relationships provide us with significant collaboration opportunities at the early product design stage, which facilitate our ability to introduce new products and applications. For example, we work with our key customers in the development of advanced manufacturing processes to identify and respond to their requests for current and future generations of products for emerging applications requiring cleaner materials. Similarly, we also collaborate with our customers to develop systems that maintain the integrity and stability of materials during transport and throughout the manufacturing process. We believe that our customer base will continue to be an important source of new product development opportunities. Due to the specialized nature of our products, complexity of our customers’ manufacturing processes, customer qualification requirements and costs associated with re-formulation and re-qualification, we believe we have a strong position with our customers.
Operational Excellence. Our customers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, dependability and consistency of their supply chains. We remain committed to operational excellence and are especially focused on the following priorities that we believe enable us to perform at the high level that our customers expect. 
•Use of manufacturing equipment and facilities incorporating leading-edge technology, including advanced cleanroom and cleaning procedures. As our customers introduce more complex architectures and search for new materials with better electrical and structural properties to improve the performance of their devices, our equipment, technology and processes must evolve to keep pace. In response, we have invested heavily in leading-edge manufacturing facilities, which are located in strategic regions throughout the world. With our global presence, we are able to efficiently utilize our portfolio of manufacturing facilities to meet our customers’ needs quickly and efficiently. 
•Implementation of automated manufacturing, quality and supply chain management systems. In recent years, we have made significant investments in quality systems to help drive automation of our processes. During this time, we have implemented standardized manufacturing systems to stress optimization of equipment effectiveness, predictive maintenance and direct labor productivity, automated quality systems that provide both process monitoring and statistical process control throughout the manufacturing process as well as predictive quality data to mitigate against potential quality deficiencies and supply chain management systems designed to ensure a reliable and responsive supply of high-quality raw materials. These systems generate large amounts of data, which we utilize to further enhance our quality, productivity and stability. Our focus on quality is evidenced by our sigma level moving from less than four in 2010 to greater than five in 2021, which represents a significant improvement in quality performance and reduction in defective parts produced. In addition, over the last several years we have earned awards from our customers for our performance and focus on continuous improvement.
•Maintaining an agile manufacturing organization. Our manufacturing workforce is capable of the rapid design and development of prototypes of new and derivative products, as well as promptly responding to customer feedback concerning prototypes so that we can quickly commercialize and ramp our production within very tight process windows required by our customers. We believe that our focus on disciplined execution and timeliness in customer interactions enables us to build even deeper connections with our customers, which in turn allows us to further understand their technical roadmaps and to help them overcome technical hurdles. 
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
We intend to build upon our position as a leading supplier of advanced materials and process solutions for the semiconductor and other high-technology industries to expand our core business and to grow in other high value-added manufacturing process markets. Our strategy includes the following key elements.
Commitment to Technology Leadership. We seek to continuously improve our products and develop new products as our customers’ needs evolve. As semiconductor devices become smaller and more powerful and new materials and processes are deployed to produce them, we seek to expand our technological capabilities by developing advanced products that address our customers’ requirements for greater purification, protection and transport of high value-added materials and by developing advanced materials for use in critical fabrication processes. 
Leveraging Our Expertise. We leverage our broad expertise across our portfolio of advanced materials, materials handling and purification capabilities to create innovative and new solutions to address unmet customer needs. For example, certain of our formulated cleaning chemistry products are developed and manufactured by our SCEM segment, with collaboration from our MC segment, packaged with our ultra-clean container and connector system made by our AMH segment, and delivered to the process tools through fluid handling systems also made by our AMH segment. Furthermore, in process tools, these chemistries may go through one or several purification systems produced by our MC segment to eliminate particles and contaminants. Similarly, our advanced deposition materials business requires comprehensive capabilities across a number of disciplines, including the synthetization of unique molecules, specialized knowledge of how to purify these materials and the capability to safely transport and deliver them onto the wafer at a high throughput. We seek to utilize our expertise in areas of strategic and increasing importance to semiconductor manufacturers, such as developing advanced materials and ensuring the purity of high-value materials, and our ability to work collaboratively across our three segments enables us to quickly and effectively develop optimized and complementary solutions for our customers.
Operational Excellence. Our strategy is to continue to develop our advanced manufacturing capabilities into a competitive advantage with our customers by conducting our manufacturing operations in a manner that ensures the safety of our employees and of the individuals using our products and by continuing to focus on the other priorities noted in the “—Our Competitive Strengths—Operational Excellence” section above.
Continued Focus on Customers. We view the strong relationships we have with our customers, which include leading logic and memory semiconductor manufacturers, OEMs and semiconductor materials suppliers, as critical to our long-term success. We intend to reinforce and further strengthen these relationships through, among other things, collaborations and joint development. Customer intimacy enables us to respond rapidly and thoroughly to their manufacturing challenges and enables us to bring forth new products that serve existing needs. 
Safety. A core component of our strategy is our intense focus on the safety of our employees and of the individuals using our products. With respect to employee safety, we have put in place proactive programs designed to build a culture of safety in our facilities. And while the well-being of our employees is always at the top of our mind, we also design our products with the safety of the people who are using them in mind. To illustrate, our Aramus high-purity bags for biologics are designed to withstand cryogenic temperatures and to not break down in extremely cold environments. By reducing ruptures during transportation, our bags enable the effective distribution of vaccines, including those that may be used in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, which may allow quicker access to a vaccine when compared to the use of traditional technologies. Also, our Safe Delivery Source products are designed to minimize potential leaks during transportation and use of hazardous gases, features which provide significant safety, environmental and productivity benefits over traditional high-pressure cylinders. 
Corporate Social Responsibility. We are embedding our corporate social responsibility program into our business strategy. Our program is built around the four core pillars of Innovation, Safety, Personal Development and Inclusion and Sustainability. The program includes goals, which are aligned to each of the four pillars, to guide it towards 2030. During 2021, we released our first annual corporate social responsibility report providing a comprehensive overview of our progress toward reaching our 2030 goals and outlining our baseline performance in 2020 across each of the four pillars. The 2020 annual corporate social responsibility report is published on our website at http://www.Entegris.com under “About Us - Corporate Social Responsibility.”
Adjacent Markets. We leverage the expertise that we have gained from serving the semiconductor industry to develop products for other industries that employ similar technologies and production processes and that utilize materials integrity management, high-purity fluids and integrated dispense systems. For example, outside of the semiconductor industry our products are used in manufacturing processes for biologics, flat panel displays, high-purity chemicals, solar cells, optical magnetic storage devices, LEDs and products for other life sciences and aerospace applications. We plan to continue to identify and develop products that address needs in adjacent markets. We believe that by utilizing our unique technical capabilities in advanced materials and contamination control and core manufacturing excellence to provide solutions across multiple industries, we are able to increase the total available market for our products and increase our return on R&D investments.
Strategic Acquisitions, Partnerships and Related Transactions. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and business partnerships that enable us to address gaps in our product offerings, secure new customers, diversify into complementary product markets, broaden our technological capabilities and product offerings, access local or regional markets and achieve benefits of increased scale. For example, we strengthened and broadened our specialty chemicals and engineered materials product offerings while also addressing gaps in our portfolio when we acquired BASF’s precision microchemicals business in 2021 and Sinmat, Inc., or Sinmat, in 2020 (CMP slurries in hard substrate applications) and Digital Specialty Chemicals, or DSC, and MPD Chemicals, or MPD, in 2019 (specialty chemicals). Similarly, we made several targeted acquisitions to diversify and expand our filtration and purification portfolio with the acquisitions of Hangzhou Anow Microfiltration Co., Ltd., or Anow, in 2019, the SAES Pure Gas business from SAES Getters S.p.A. in 2018, and the water and chemical filtration product line for microelectronics applications from W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. in 2017. Finally, we added a suite of analytical instruments utilized in chemistry management and monitoring in semiconductor manufacturing processes to our product portfolio with our acquisitions of Global Measurement Technologies, Inc. in 2020 and Particle Sizing Systems, LLC in 2018. Our 2014 acquisition of ATMI, Inc., or ATMI, serves as an example of a strategic transaction that significantly increased our scale, as the acquisition brought a whole new portfolio of technologies and materials products to serve our semiconductor customers. Similarly, our proposed acquisition of CMC would significantly increase our scale and broaden our product and technology portfolio. Further, as the dynamics of the markets that we serve shift, we will reevaluate our existing businesses and may decide to restructure or replace one or more businesses, such as the sale of our small cleaning business in France in 2018 and exiting our small cleaning business in Taiwan in 2020. Finally, we regularly evaluate opportunities for strategic alliances, such as our strategic alliance with Enthone, joint development programs and collaborative marketing efforts with key customers and other industry leaders. For example, we have agreements with local partners to expand our capability to manufacture certain specialty chemical and deposition products locally and shorten our supply chain for our customers in China. 
OUR SEGMENTS
Our business is organized and operated in three segments which align with the key elements of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem: Specialty Chemicals and Engineered Materials, or SCEM; Microcontamination Control, or MC; and Advanced Materials Handling, or AMH. We leverage our expertise from these three segments to create new and increasingly integrated solutions for our customers. The following is a detailed description of our three segments.
SPECIALTY CHEMICALS AND ENGINEERED MATERIALS SEGMENT
The SCEM segment provides high-performance and high-purity process chemistries, gases and materials that enhance our customers’ product performance. These materials are utilized in critical semiconductor manufacturing processes such as deposition, cleaning and integration of complex process materials. Advanced materials, delivered at high purity, are critical to enabling the performance of leading-edge logic and memory applications.
