Item 1. Description of Business
Business Development
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming on June 19, 1969. Following an involuntary dissolution for failure to file an annual report, the Company was reinstated as a Wyoming corporation on October 14, 1999. On January 28, 2000, the company, through a majority shareholder vote, changed its domicile to Nevada through a merger with EMC Energies, Inc., a Nevada corporation. The Plan of Merger provided for the dissenting shareholders to be paid the amount, if any, to which they would be entitled under the Wyoming Corporation Statutes with respect to the rights of dissenting shareholders. The Company also changed its par value to $.001 and the amount of authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares.
 
Prior to 1990, the Company was engaged in the business of exploring for and producing oil and gas in the Rocky Mountain and mid-continental areas of the United States. The Company liquidated substantially all of its assets in 1990 and was dormant until June 30, 2000, when it acquired, in a stock-for-stock, tax-free exchange, all of the outstanding common stock of a privately held Virginia corporation, Metwood, Inc. ("Metwood"), which was incorporated in 1993. See Form 8-K and attached exhibits filed August 11, 2000. Metwood has been in the metal and metal/wood construction materials manufacturing business since 1992. Following the acquisition, the Company approved a name change from EMC Energies, Inc. to Metwood, Inc.
 
Effective January 1, 2002, Metwood acquired certain assets of Providence Engineering, PC ("Providence"), a professional engineering firm with customers in the same proximity as Metwood, for $350,000 and accounted for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting. As of June 30, 2012, Providence was no longer an operating segment of the Company. A decision was made that the majority of the engineering portion of the business could best be handled through a strategic partnership with an outside engineering firm. We believe that continuing research and development efforts will soon enable us to meet code requirements for our products and will eliminate the need for individual engineering seals.

Metwood ("the Company," "We," "Us," "Our") provides construction-related products and engineering services to residential customers and contractors, commercial contractors, developers and retail enterprises, primarily in southwestern Virginia.
 
Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
Residential builders are aware of the superiority of steel framing vs. wood framing, insofar as steel framing is lighter; stronger; termite, pest, rot and fire resistant; and dimensionally more stable in withstanding induced loads. Although use of steel framing in residential construction has generally increased each year since 1980, many residential builders have been hesitant to utilize steel due to the need to retrain framers and subcontractors who are accustomed to a "stick-built" construction method where components are laid out and assembled with nails and screws. The Company's founders saw the need to combine the strength and durability of steel with the convenience and familiarity of wood and wood fasteners.
 
Metwood manufactures light-gage steel construction materials, usually combined with wood or wood fasteners, for use in residential and commercial applications in place of more conventional wood products, which are inferior in terms of strength and durability. The steel and steel/wood products allow structures to be built with increased load strength and structural integrity and fewer support beams or support configurations, thereby allowing for structural designs that are not possible with wood-only products.
 
Metwood's primary products are:
 


· | TUFF BEAM - internally reinforced cold-formed steel beam 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | TUFF JOIST - cold-formed steel joint system 
· | TUFF JOIST+ - internally reinforced cold-formed steel joist 
· | TUFF FLOOR SYSTEM - combinations of TUFFBEAM, NUJOIST and TUFFJOIST are utilized to make up a complete floor system
· | TUFF DECK - concrete deck systems 
· | RIM BEAM - internally reinforced CFS load distribution member 
· | TUFF FRAME 3.5 & 5.5 - a fully proprietary panelized load bearing and non-load bearing CFS wall framing solution 
· | TUFF TRUSS 2.0 - a proprietary roof and floor truss system 
· | Aegis - Metwood is a distributor of Aegis Metal Framing's cold-formed steel trusses SURE-SPAN™ 
· | Trimmable square columns 
· | Joist reinforcers 
· | Engineering, design and custom building services 

Metwood's services include providing its customers, through a strategic partnership with an outside engineering firm, civil engineering capabilities which include rezoning and special use submissions; erosion and sediment control and storm-water management design; residential, commercial, and religious facility site development design; and utility design, including water, sewer and onsite treatment systems. Metwood also performs ongoing product research and development.

We also perform a variety of structural design and analysis work, successfully providing solutions for many projects, including retaining walls, residential framing, commercial building framing, light-gage steel fabrication drawings, metal building retrofits and additions, mezzanines, and seismic anchors and restraints.
 
The Company has designed numerous foundations for a variety of structures. Our foundation design expertise includes metal building foundations, traditional building construction foundations, atypical foundations for residential structures, tower foundations, and sign foundations for a variety of uses and applications.
 
We have also designed and drafted full building plans for several applications. When subcontracting for local companies, we have the ability, in partnership with our outside engineering firm, to provide basic architectural, mechanical, electrical, and detailed civil and structural design services for these facilities.
 
We have reviewed designs by manufacturers for a variety of structures and structural components, including retaining walls, radio towers, tower foundations, sign foundations, timber trusses, light- gage steel trusses, and light-gage steel beams. This service enables clients to take generic designs and have them certified and approved for construction in the desired locality.
 
Distribution Methods of Products and Services
 
Our sales are primarily wholesale, directly to lumberyards, home improvement stores, hardware stores, and plumbing and electrical suppliers in Virginia and North Carolina. Metwood relies primarily on its own sales force to generate sales; additionally, however, the Company has distributors in Virginia, New York, Oklahoma, Arizona and Colorado and also utilizes the salespeople of wholesale yards stocking the Company's products as an additional sales force. We are an authorized vendor for Lowe's, Home Depot, 84 Lumber, Builders First Source, Ferguson, and, many more local and regional suppliers. We have several stocking dealers of our square columns and reinforcing products. We will sell directly to contractors in areas where we do not have a dealer, but with our national dealer relationships, we typically have a dealer to use.
 
Metwood intends to continue expanding the wholesale marketing of its unique products to retailers, to increase dealer sales, and to license the Company's technology and products to increase its distribution outside of Virginia, North Carolina and the South.
 
Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services
 
Metwood has become a fabricator of the Aegis steel truss system and is a supplier of their products to both residential and commercial customers.

Seasonality of Market
 
Our sales are subject to seasonal impacts, as our products are used in residential and commercial construction projects which tend to be at peak levels in Virginia and North Carolina between the months of March and October. Accordingly, our sales are typically greater in our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We build an inventory of our products throughout the winter and spring to support our sales season. Due to the seasonality of our local market, we are continuing our efforts to expand into markets that are not so seasonally impacted. We have shipped projects to Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Arizona, Washington, and more. These markets have some seasonality, but increased exposure in these markets will help maintain stronger sales year round.
Competition
 
Nationally, there are over one hundred manufacturers of the types of products produced by the Company. However, the majority of these manufacturers are using wood-only products or products without metal reinforcement. Metwood has identified only one other manufacturer in the United States that manufactures a wood-metal floor truss similar to ours. However, we have often found that our products are the only ones that will work within many customers' design specs.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers
 
All of the raw materials we use are readily available on the market from numerous suppliers. The light-gage metal used by the Company is supplied primarily by Telling Industries, New Millenium, Allied Tube & Conduit, and Vulcraft. Our main source of lumber is BlueLinx. Adelphia Metals, Re- Steel, Nucor and Gerdau Amersteel provide the majority of our rebar. Because of the number of suppliers available to us, our decisions in purchasing materials are dictated primarily by price and secondarily by availability. We do not anticipate a lack of supply to affect our production; however, a shortage might cause us to pass on higher materials prices to our buyers.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
At June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company had the following customer concentrations:
 

 | Sales | | | Accounts Receivable

Each of the above-mentioned patents was originally issued to the inventors and Company founders, Robert Callahan and Ronald B. Shiflett, who licensed these patents to us.
 
Need for Government Approval of Principal Products
 
Our products must either be sold with an engineer's seal or applicable building code approval. Currently, we are seeking International Code Council ("ICC") code approval on our TUFFBEAMS. Once that approval is obtained, our products can be used in all fifty states and will eliminate the need for an engineer's seal on individual products. To date, the Company's 2x10 floor joist reinforcer has received both Bureau Officials Code Association approval (2001) and ICC approval (2004). At the date this document was filed the Company continues to test products to achieve it’s stated goal.
Time Spent During the Last Two Fiscal Years on Research and Development Activities
 
There is no fixed time that our time and resources have been spent during the last two fiscal years researching and developing our metal/wood products, new product lines, and new patents. Time and resources are utilized on research and development as required.
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We do not incur any costs to comply with environmental laws. We are an environmentally friendly business in that our products are fabricated from recycled steel.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full-Time Employees
 
We had fourteen employees at June 30, 2017, thirteen of whom were full time.
