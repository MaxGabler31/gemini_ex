Item 1. | Business.

Overview
AK Steel Holding Corporation (“AK Holding”) was formed under the laws of Delaware in 1993. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, AK Steel Corporation (“AK Steel”), it is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, primarily for the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, and distributors and converters markets. Other subsidiaries also provide customer solutions with carbon and stainless steel tubing products, advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped steel components, and complex assemblies. AK Steel is the successor to Armco Inc. and has built upon Armco’s rich history of creating leading-edge steel innovations since its formation in 1899. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to AK Holding and its subsidiaries.
Our mission is to create innovative, high-quality steel solutions for our customers and our key values of safety, quality, productivity and innovation, along with environmental responsibility and sustainability, are its foundation. We have approximately 9,500 employees in North America and Europe, as well as manufacturing operations across seven states in the eastern U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Our corporate strategy is comprised of three pillars:

• | commercializing our innovative new products and services;


• | transforming our operations to significantly improve our competitive position; and


• | driving future growth into new markets and downstream businesses.

Customers and Markets
We target customers who require comprehensive steel solutions that involve the most technically demanding, highest-quality steel products, “just-in-time” delivery, technical support and product development assistance. Our research and engineering expertise, robust product quality and delivery capabilities, as well as our emphasis on collaborative customer technical support and product planning, are critical factors in our ability to serve our customer markets. Our strategy is to focus on markets for our steel solutions that deliver higher margins, where possible, and reduce amounts sold into the typically lower-margin steel spot markets, which have experienced substantial volatility in pricing over the past several years primarily as a result of shifting international trade environments and related effects on the domestic markets we serve.
We sell our products to customers in three broad market categories: (i) automotive; (ii) infrastructure and manufacturing, which includes electrical power; and (iii) distributors and converters. The following table presents the percentage of our net sales to each of these markets:

Market | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Automotive | 63 | % | | | % | | %
Infrastructure and Manufacturing | | % | | | % | 16 | %
Distributors and Converters | 22 | % | | 19 | % | 18 | %

We sold approximately 70% of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2018 under fixed base price contracts. These contracts are typically one year in duration and expire at various times throughout the year. Some of these contracts have a surcharge mechanism that passes through certain changes in input costs. We sold the remainder of our flat-rolled steel shipments in 2018 into the spot market at prevailing market prices or under annual contracts that have pricing provisions that are typically linked to a steel index with price adjustments based on a prior monthly or quarterly reference point. The increase in the percent of net sales to the Distributors and Converters market in 2018 is reflective of the substantial increase in spot market pricing from 2017 to 2018 and an increase in tons opportunistically sold into that market in 2018 as a result of the favorable conditions.
Automotive Market
The automotive industry is our core market, and we aim to address the principal needs of major automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. We specialize in manufacturing difficult-to-produce, high-quality steel products combined with demanding delivery performance, customer technical support and collaborative relationships to develop breakthrough steel solutions that help our customers meet their product requirements. In addition, many of our competitors do not have the capability to supply all of the 
- 1-


products that we make for our automotive customers, such as steel for exposed automotive applications, the most sophisticated grades of advanced high-strength steels (“AHSS”) and value-added stainless chrome products. The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally enable us to justify higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets.
In light of the automotive market’s importance to us, North American light vehicle production has a significant impact on our total sales and shipments. North American light vehicle production for 2018 declined slightly to approximately 17.0 million units from the prior year. Demand for SUVs, trucks, crossovers and larger vehicles continued to increase while demand for smaller sedans and compact cars declined, and we benefited from intentionally targeting larger vehicle platforms to take advantage of the trend. Over the past several years, we have focused on and have been successful in getting sourced on numerous SUV, truck, crossover and larger vehicle platforms. As a result, about three-quarters of the carbon automotive steel that we sell is used to produce these popular larger vehicles. In addition to benefiting from our exposure to consumers’ strong demand for larger vehicles, these vehicles also typically contain a higher volume of steel than smaller sedans and compact cars, providing us the opportunity to sell a greater proportion of our steel products to our automotive customers. Ford Motor Company accounted for 11% and 12% of our net sales in 2018 and 2017, and FCA (an affiliate of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.) accounted for 10% of our net sales in 2018. No other customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in either year.
Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve heightened federally mandated fuel economy standards through 2025 (the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE,” standards). The CAFE standards generally require automobile manufacturers to meet an average fuel economy goal of 54.5 miles per gallon across the fleet of vehicles they produce by the year 2025, with certain milestones to be met in interim periods. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have proposed lowering the fuel economy goal under the CAFE standards. However, California and other states continue to maintain the more stringent emissions standards, and certain auto makers have expressed differing preferences for approaches to regulation aimed at improving fuel efficiencies. As a result, our automotive customers continue to explore various avenues for achieving the standards, including lightweighting of components and developing more efficient engines. Lightweighting efforts include testing alternatives to traditional carbon steels, such as AHSS and other materials. While this could reduce the aggregate volume of steel consumed by the automotive industry, we expect that demand will increase for current and next-generation AHSS and that our AHSS and other innovative steels will command higher margins. We are collaborating with our automotive customers and their suppliers to develop innovative solutions using our developments in lightweighting, efficiency, strength and formability across our extensive product portfolio, in combination with our automotive stamping and tube-making capabilities. We are also working with our customers to develop steels with greater heat resistance for exhaust systems that support new, fuel-efficient engines that run at higher temperatures.
Automotive manufacturers have also been increasing their development of hybrid/electric vehicles (“H/EVs”) in order to meet the CAFE standards and growing customer adoption of H/EVs. Many motors used in H/EVs being sold in the U.S. today are imported from foreign suppliers, but more local sourcing and manufacturing of motors may occur in the future. We believe our strong foundation in electrical steels and long-standing relationships with automotive manufacturers and their other suppliers will provide us with an advantage in this market as it grows and matures in the future.
Infrastructure and Manufacturing Market
The infrastructure and manufacturing market primarily represents sales to manufacturers of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, appliances, and power transmission and distribution transformers, who produce equipment for the electrical grid. Domestic construction activity and the replacement of aging infrastructure directly affects sales of our carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, particularly for grain-oriented electrical steel (“GOES”). Housing starts in the U.S. improved approximately 5% over the prior year, and we expect a general lift in demand for a variety of our steel products if construction accelerates. We also believe that the market growth of H/EVs may require upgrades to the U.S. electrical grid infrastructure to support increased demand for electricity, and thus increased demand for our GOES products.
Over the past couple of years, electrical steel pricing declined in many international markets, which contributed to GOES imports into the U.S. doubling in the first quarter of 2018 from 2017 and suppressing domestic electrical steel pricing in 2018. We continue to assess various alternatives to ensure that foreign producers of GOES are required to comply with U.S. trade laws, including encouraging the vigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations.
Distributors and Converters Market
Steel distributors and converters typically source from the commodity carbon, stainless and electrical spot markets. Demand and pricing can be highly dependent on a variety of factors outside our control, including global and domestic commodity steel production capacity, the relative health of countries’ economies and whether they are consuming or exporting excess steel capacity, the provisions of international trade agreements and fluctuations in international currencies and, therefore, are subject to a high degree of volatility. 
- 2-


Because of this volatility and our strategy to focus on value-added products, we have taken deliberate actions to reduce our exposure to these commodity markets.
Geographic Presence
We sell our carbon steel products principally to customers in North America, and we sell our electrical and stainless steel products primarily in North America and Europe. Our customer base is geographically diverse and there is no single country outside the U.S. where our sales are material compared to our total net sales.
Research, Innovation and Operations
Rapidly evolving and highly competitive markets require our customers to seek new, comprehensive steel solutions, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver the most responsive solutions through our broad portfolio of offerings. We are the only steelmaker in North America that can produce all three major categories of flat-rolled steels: carbon, stainless and electrical. In addition to our flat-rolled steels, our broad product portfolio includes carbon and stainless tubular products, sophisticated tool and die designs, and lightweight, complex, hard-to-manufacture components and sub-assemblies for the automotive market. The collaboration across our steel, tube-making, stamping and materials research groups results in the generation of more innovative and comprehensive solutions for our customers, which we believe improves our competitive advantage.
Creating innovative products and breakthrough solutions is a strategic priority, as we believe differentiation through higher value steels to meet challenging requirements enables us to maintain and enhance our margins. We conduct a broad range of research and development activities aimed at improving existing products and processes and developing new ones. Our tradition of leading steel innovation has produced a highly diversified flat-rolled steel product portfolio. In recent years, we have increased our commitment to research and development with greater investment, both in personnel and capabilities. One of these investments, our state-of-the-art Research and Innovation Center in Middletown, Ohio, has resulted in enhanced technical collaboration and increased introduction of new steel solutions to the marketplace.
Awards and Recognition
We are unwavering in our quality expectations, and we take a planned approach to continuously improve our products, processes and services. This approach is key to our strategic partnerships with our customers, and we received several noteworthy awards from them in 2018. In April, we were the only North American steelmaker recognized as a “GM Supplier of the Year” for 2017 for superior performance in quality, execution, innovation and total enterprise cost. In May, both the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”) and the Auto/Steel Partnership recognized AK Steel Research and Innovation employees for distinguished research in steel forming behavior and pre-competitive steel solutions in future vehicle designs.
In October, the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) selected us to receive an award of up to $1.2 under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office program to investigate novel low-density steels, which may ultimately be used in automotive structural applications. The three-year project will be conducted in collaboration with the DOE, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Materials Science and Technology Division, and the Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center at the Colorado School of Mines. The objective of the project is to conduct alloy design, laboratory validation, and testing of low-density steels that are alternatives to currently available advanced high strength steels and other lightweight metals. These low-density steels are expected to generate energy savings by bringing efficiencies in manufacturing and lifetime savings in automotive structural applications. This was the second award that we have received from the DOE in the past two years. We are currently in the second year of a three-year project awarded to us in May 2017 by the DOE to develop the next generation of advanced non-oriented electrical steel (“NOES”) for motors used in a wide variety of industrial and automotive applications. Laboratory proof of concept for this project has been successfully completed and industrial scale trials are currently underway.
Carbon Steel 
We sell flat-rolled carbon steel products, consisting of premium-quality coated, cold-rolled, and hot-rolled carbon steel products, primarily to automotive manufacturers and their suppliers, as well as to customers in the infrastructure and manufacturing market. We also sell carbon steel products to distributors, service centers and converters, who may further process these products before reselling them. We are particularly focused on AHSS for the automotive market, and we produce virtually every AHSS grade currently used by our customers. Our AHSS grades, such as Dual Phase 590, 780 and 980, have been adopted by our customers for both stamped and roll-formed parts. Looking forward, our NEXMET 1000 and 1200 grades provide even greater enhancements in strength and formability, and represent the next generation of automotive lightweighting steels for cold-stamping operations.
- 3-


Press-Hardenable Steel
We also provide press-hardenable steel (“PHS”) products for hot-stamping applications. Our ULTRALUME® PHS is an aluminized Type 1 heat-treatable boron steel. Our customers depend on ULTRALUME PHS when they require high-strength parts with complex geometries. These steels enable automotive manufacturers to reduce vehicle weight while continuing to keep pace with critical safety requirements. 
Third-Generation Advanced High-Strength Steel
We continue to expand our portfolio of third-generation AHSS. Our NEXMET® 440EX product was developed for use in surface-critical, exposed auto body panels. Our NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS products enable our customers to achieve significant lightweighting in the unexposed structural components of their vehicles. NEXMET 1200, for example, offers better formability than conventional Dual Phase 600 steel, at twice the strength level. These AHSS products allow automotive engineers to design lightweight parts that meet rigorous service and safety requirements. Product qualification is presently underway with several automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) for both galvanized and cold-rolled NEXMET 1000 and NEXMET 1200 AHSS. Also, a number of stamping trials have been completed successfully. The NEXMET family of steels helps our customers achieve vehicle weight savings for ambitious fuel efficiency standards while avoiding significant capital costs required to re-design production facilities to use alternative materials.
Specialty Stainless and Electrical Steel
We continue to develop new and improved specialty stainless and electrical steels for a variety of applications in the automotive, infrastructure and manufacturing, and other markets. For example, we are working with our automotive customers and their exhaust system suppliers to develop new stainless steels for exhaust systems that can withstand higher exhaust gas temperatures associated with future engine designs to achieve increased fuel economy. These steels exhibit improved thermal fatigue and corrosion resistance over currently available materials. We are also developing stainless steels with unique cosmetic appearances (specialized finishes and colors) for use in architectural and appliance applications.
We are a global leader in producing the highest-quality electrical steel products, and our electrical steels are among the most energy efficient in the world. We sell our electrical steel products, which are iron-silicon alloys with unique magnetic properties, primarily to manufacturers of power transmission and distribution transformers and electrical motors and generators, in the infrastructure and manufacturing markets. These customers require high-quality steels with low core losses and high magnetic permeability for the production of efficient electrical transformers, which help to lower costs of electricity generation, transmission and distribution.
We focus on the high-end of the electrical steel market, as GOES is technically challenging to produce and typically commands a higher selling price than grades of NOES. In the second quarter of 2018, we launched our TRAN-COR® X product, which is a high-permeability GOES that will help transformer manufacturers design to higher levels of efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to energy loss in electricity transmission and distribution. High-permeability GOES products represent the most technologically advanced and highest-efficiency electrical steels in the world. We believe the superior efficiency of our GOES products is attractive to customers in markets with increasing efficiency standards, such as Europe and the United States. We also continue to work with automotive OEMs and their suppliers to qualify DI-MAX® HF-10X, both as a semi-processed and fully processed NOES designed to meet specific OEM requirements for use in high-speed motors, traction motors, aircraft generators and certain other rotating equipment.
Downstream Steel Applications
In 2017, we expanded our portfolio of steel solutions by acquiring PPHC Holdings, LLC (“Precision Partners”), which provides advanced-engineered solutions, tool design and build, hot- and cold-stamped components and complex assemblies for the automotive market. In addition to Precision Partners, our downstream operations include Combined Metals of Chicago, LLC and AK Tube LLC (“AK Tube”), which manufactures advanced tubular products for automotive and other applications using carbon and stainless steels. We believe that collaboration among Precision Partners, AK Tube and our steelmaking operations can accelerate the adoption of our innovative steel products by automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers by enabling us to provide them with steel solutions, rather than simply offering steel.
Our research and technical experts, along with engineers from Precision Partners and AK Tube, have undertaken numerous collaborative projects that are generating robust solutions for our customers. Precision Partners’ expertise in tool design and stamping capabilities has allowed us to create prototype components using AK Steel’s innovative new materials and present customers with new potential steel solutions. This approach has and will continue to demonstrate to customers that they can significantly lightweight automotive parts on an accelerated timeline and in a cost-effective manner by using our highly formable grades of AHSS in place of traditional lower-strength grades.
- 4-


In addition, our collaborative projects are enhancing our collective knowledge and experience in the stamping of new, advanced grades of steel, advanced-engineered solutions, and tool design and build. For example, Precision Partners specializes in hot-stamping PHS for automotive applications. AK Steel’s experience as a leader in PHS and Precision Partners’ expertise in hot-stamping has enabled these teams to have greater insight into these high-growth areas and has accelerated product development and customer adoption of these automotive lightweighting solutions. Likewise, collaboration with AK Tube strategically advances our mission to innovate in AHSS for the automotive industry, as AK Tube has been at the forefront of producing tubular products from third-generation AHSS. We believe the combination of Precision Partners’ stamping and advanced die-making capabilities, AK Tube’s leading tubemaking capabilities and AK Steel’s breakthrough material introductions will enhance our ability to deliver innovative, steel solutions to our customers.
Precision Partners was recently awarded a contract with a major automotive manufacturer to supply a body-side outer subassembly, consisting of a single-piece hot-stamped door ring. They were also awarded a second single-piece hot-stamped door ring on another vehicle platform by a key Tier 1 supplier. Taken together, the two awards represent approximately $50.0 of projected annual stamping and assembly revenue beginning in mid-2020, in addition to revenue from a large, one-time tooling award. In winning these contracts, Precision Partners has been able to leverage its hot-stamping tooling leadership, in addition to their innovative hot-stamping process, to capture new strategic opportunities and demonstrate that they are one of the few companies in North America that has the technical capabilities to produce a major subassembly and stamping job of this nature.
Sustainability
We are committed to operating in a sustainable manner. Beyond ensuring that we are acting responsibly to serve our communities and the environment, sustainably operating our company also provides us opportunities to grow our business, increase customer collaboration and loyalty, attract, retain and motivate employees, and differentiate us from our competition. Steel is the most recycled material on the planet—more than aluminum, plastic, paper and glass combined each year—which provides a strong foundation for our sustainability efforts. In May 2018, we issued our 2017 Sustainability Report, which provides significantly increased disclosure and transparency regarding our corporate-wide sustainability efforts and highlights our efforts to support our employees, encourage diversity and inclusion, contribute to our communities, and demonstrate our commitment to the environment, among other items. We also disclose our steelmaking operations’ energy and water usage, emissions, waste generation and targets for reducing our environmental footprint. In addition, our Sustainability Report includes our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions, which are generally direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, and reduction targets for those emissions. Our Sustainability Report (which is not incorporated into this Annual Report) can be found in the “Corporate Citizenship” section of our website at www.aksteel.com.
Employee Safety
Our employees and their safety are of paramount importance to us. Our occupational health and safety policies and programs are the cornerstone of our operating philosophy and are integrated into all of our daily operations and activities. We rigorously manage, control and focus on eliminating or minimizing potential exposure to the hazards associated with making and working around steel. Our low recordable injury rate, based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) criteria, reflects our effectiveness in protecting our employees. In 2018, three of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries for the entire year, and seven of our facilities operated with zero OSHA recordable injuries during the fourth quarter. Our 2018 performance at our steelmaking facilities (year-to-date through the third quarter, which is the latest industry information currently available), measured as the number of OSHA recordable injuries per 200,000 labor hours, was 0.64, which was more than two times better than the industry average.
We consistently lead the U.S. steel industry in safety, outperforming the steel industry average injury frequencies for each of the last ten years, and we have received numerous awards recognizing our safety performance. In May, the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute, a leading industry trade organization, granted both our Middletown Works and our Mountain State Carbon coke plants the Max Eward Safety Award for 2017 for operating the safest cokemaking facilities in America. In July, our Coshocton Works and Zanesville Works both received the “Special Award for Safety” from the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, division of Safety and Hygiene (“Ohio BWC”), recognizing more than 500,000 hours and at least six months without an injury resulting in a day or more away from work. In 2018, Zanesville Works also received the Ohio BWC’s “100% Award,” recognizing zero injuries or illnesses resulting in a day or more away from work during the previous year.
Environmental Responsibility
We maintain an unwavering commitment to responsible environmental performance throughout our operations. In 2018, we experienced another year of outstanding overall environmental performance. In addition, to emphasize and reinforce the importance of sustainability and environmental responsibility at the company and to continue to drive improved performance in these areas, in January 2018 our Board of Directors incorporated an environmental performance component into our annual management incentive 
- 5-


plan. After assessing a variety of potential performance categories to incorporate, including an evaluation of areas most ripe for improvement, the Board chose to include air permit deviation events as a category for measuring performance under our annual management incentive plan for 2018. An air permit deviation event occurs when an event at our steelmaking operations results in noncompliance under the Title V air permits that govern those facilities. In 2018, we had our best performance in the past five years in terms of air permit deviation events, recording our lowest annual total during that period.
We believe that our strong environmental performance is a direct result of the proactive approach we take to environmental management and the close collaborative efforts that we employ across the company. We target sustainable performance in all aspects of our operations, including continuous improvement in operations that include air, water and waste management. Our comprehensive environmental policy provides that we will:

• | commit the necessary resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits and agreements applicable to us;


• | reduce environmental risks through operating practices and emergency preparedness programs;


• | encourage recycling, recovery and reuse of residual materials, as well as the reduction and prevention of emissions and releases when feasible;


• | participate in efforts to develop and implement environmental laws and regulations;


• | continually evaluate compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; and


• | strive for continually improving the effectiveness of our environmental management efforts.

Certain production units in our operations are inherently water-intensive. However, we continuously seek opportunities to reduce water usage and increase water reuse at our steelmaking plants. In addition, our steelmaking facilities are located near abundant sources of water and we do not believe that any of those operations are located in regions that experience high water stress.
The International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) has certified all of our steelmaking plants with ISO 14001 environmental management certification, and our environmental affairs professionals oversee environmental compliance throughout our organization. We also invest heavily in equipment to help meet our environmental objectives. For example, in 2018, we spent $126.3 to operate and maintain our environmental controls and invested $7.1 in environmental projects. In 2019, we plan to invest approximately $6.0 at our Rockport Works to begin installation of a more modern, environmentally friendly and lower-cost pickling process.
Strategic Opportunities Related to Climate Change
Our strategy of creating new innovative steel solutions and improving existing products enables us to contribute to carbon reduction efforts and the achievement of sustainability goals throughout the product supply chain. Innovative products in each of the carbon, stainless, electrical and tubular steel families further the sustainability goals of many of our customers. For example, in the automotive market our customers are benefiting from our carbon lightweighting solutions to meet their heightened fuel economy targets under the CAFE standards. We are also providing customers with stainless steel and tubular solutions that allow for greater heat resistance in vehicle exhaust systems, enabling exhaust systems to handle the higher engine exhaust temperatures needed for increased fuel economy. In addition, we continue to develop higher-efficiency NOES products for use in future H/EVs and GOES products for their required infrastructure, a market that we anticipate will grow over time. Our steels also contribute to sustainability goals beyond the automotive market. For instance, our GOES products are among the highest-efficiency electrical steels in the world. These GOES products provide low core loss and high magnetic permeability to move electricity across electrical grids in the U.S. and around the world more efficiently through better-performing electrical transformers.
While greenhouse gas emissions are a natural byproduct of steel manufacturing today, we continue to take steps to increase energy efficiency while remaining competitive in the global steel marketplace. For example, through the American Iron and Steel Institute (“AISI”), we participate in the DOE’s Climate VISION agreement. This program assists domestic steelmakers in their continued efforts to lead the global steel sector in voluntary emissions reductions. We are also a member of the federal ENERGY STAR program, which identifies and promotes energy-efficient products to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ENERGY STAR is a joint program of the EPA and the DOE, helping businesses and consumers save money and protect the environment through energy-efficient products and practices. As with other companies engaged in the production of steel, certain aspects of our production process are carbon-intensive and current technology does not currently afford us the ability to dramatically lower our direct greenhouse gas emissions without significantly reducing the scope of our operations. However, we and other steel producers in the United States are actively participating in research and development to develop technology, processes and approaches to reduce emissions during the steelmaking processes, but these developments are likely to occur over the longer term.
In addition, the production phase of steelmaking is less carbon-intensive than the processes for producing certain other competing materials, such as aluminum. Thus, while the CAFE standards have motivated the use of alternative materials in some vehicles to help achieve lightweighting goals, we intend to continue to educate governments, the automotive industry and other key stakeholders that 
- 6-


steel is the most sustainable metal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire life cycle of a vehicle. These benefits are made even greater when utilizing our advanced steel products for vehicle lightweighting.
As discussed above, we began to share more information publicly during 2018 on greenhouse gas emissions from our steelmaking operations and our targeted emissions reductions. Our Sustainability Report issued in May 2018 included an inventory of our scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions at our steelmaking plants, along with time-bound, quantitative targets for reducing scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions at those plants. Over time, we also plan to expand our efforts to scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, which generally are indirect emissions from purchased energy sources, as we develop our internal systems for tracking and targeting scope 1 greenhouse gas reductions.
Production Resources
Employees
Approximately 5,700 of our 9,500 employees are represented by labor unions. The labor contracts covering these represented employees expire between 2019 and 2021. See the discussion under Labor Agreements in Item 7 for additional information on these agreements.
In October, we partnered with the International Association of Machinists, Local Lodge 1943, to launch an apprenticeship program at our Middletown Works. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services approved the apprenticeship standards, and the program gives union production employees the opportunity to train to become fully accredited journeymen through classroom work and job training. We have similar programs at other locations.
Raw Materials and Other Inputs
Our steel manufacturing operations require carbon and stainless steel scrap, coal, coke, chrome, iron ore, nickel and zinc as primary raw materials. We also use natural gas, electricity, graphite electrodes and industrial gases. We typically purchase carbon and stainless steel scrap, natural gas, a substantial portion of our electricity and most other raw materials at prevailing market prices, which may fluctuate with market supply and demand. However, we make most of our purchases of iron ore, coke, industrial gases and a portion of our electricity at negotiated prices under annual or multi-year agreements with periodic price adjustments. We purchase substantially all of our iron ore from one supplier under multi-year contracts. We typically purchase most of our metallurgical coal under annual fixed-price agreements, but we also obtain approximately 15% of our metallurgical coal needs from our own mine at AK Coal. Additionally, we may hedge portions of our energy and raw materials purchases to reduce volatility and risk, which is discussed in more detail in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A.
We also attempt to reduce the risk of future supply shortages and price volatility in other ways. If multi-year contracts are available in the marketplace, we may use these contracts to secure sufficient supply to satisfy our key raw material needs. When multi-year contracts are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we purchase the remainder of our raw materials needs under annual contracts or make spot purchases. We also regularly evaluate alternative sources and substitute materials. We believe that we have secured, or will be able to secure, adequate supply sources for our raw materials and energy requirements for 2019.
Competition
We principally compete with domestic and foreign producers of flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel, carbon and stainless tubular products, aluminum, carbon fiber, concrete and other materials that may be used as a substitute for flat-rolled steels in manufactured products. Precision Partners competes against other tooling and stamping companies in a highly fragmented market.
Price, quality, on-time delivery, customer service and product innovation are the primary competitive factors in the steel industry and vary in importance according to the product category and customer requirements. Steel producers that sell to the automotive market face competition from aluminum manufacturers (and, to a lesser extent, other materials) as automotive manufacturers attempt to develop vehicles that will enable them to satisfy more stringent, government-imposed fuel efficiency standards. To address automotive manufacturers’ lightweighting needs that the aluminum industry is targeting, we and others in the steel industry are developing AHSS grades that we believe provide weight savings similar to aluminum, while being stronger, less costly, more sustainable, easier to repair and more environmentally friendly. In addition, our automotive customers who continue to use steel, as opposed to aluminum and other alternative materials, are able to avoid the significant capital expenditures required to re-tool their manufacturing process to accommodate the use of non-steel materials.
Mini-mills generally offer a narrower range of products than integrated steel mills, but have been expanding their product capabilities in recent years. In addition, mini-mills have some competitive cost advantages as a result of their different production processes and 
- 7-


lower labor costs associated with what are often non-union workforces. However, mini-mills do not have the equipment capabilities to produce the product range that we offer, nor do they possess our depth of research and development.
Domestic steel producers, including us, face significant competition from foreign producers. For many reasons, these foreign producers often are able to sell products in the U.S. at prices substantially lower than domestic producers. Depending on the country of origin, these reasons may include generous government subsidies; lower labor, raw material, energy and regulatory costs; less stringent environmental regulations; less stringent safety requirements; the maintenance of artificially low exchange rates against the U.S. dollar; and preferential trade practices in their home countries. In recent years, the annual level of imports of foreign steel into the United States has increased over historical levels and is affected to varying degrees by the relative level of steel production in China and other countries, the strength of demand for steel outside the U.S. and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against various foreign currencies. Imports of finished steel into the United States accounted for approximately 23%, 27% and 26% of domestic steel market consumption in 2018, 2017 and 2016, levels that are higher than the historic norm.
We continue to provide pension and healthcare benefits to a great number of our retirees, resulting in a competitive disadvantage compared to certain other domestic and foreign steel producers that do not provide such benefits to any or most of their retirees. However, we have taken a number of actions to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs, including negotiating progressive labor agreements that have significantly reduced total employment costs at all of our union-represented facilities, transferring all responsibility for healthcare benefits for various groups of retirees to Voluntary Employee Benefits Association trusts, offering voluntary lump-sum settlements to pension plan participants, lowering retiree benefit costs for salaried employees, and transferring pension obligations to highly rated insurance companies. These actions have not only reduced some of the risks associated with our pension fund obligations, but more importantly have reduced our risk exposure to the financial markets that drive pension funding requirements. We continue to actively seek opportunities to reduce pension and healthcare benefits costs.
