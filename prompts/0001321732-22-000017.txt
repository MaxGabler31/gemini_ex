ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview 
References herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Penumbra,” refer to Penumbra, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise.
Penumbra is a global healthcare company focused on innovative therapies. We design, develop, manufacture and market novel products and have a broad portfolio that addresses challenging medical conditions in markets with significant unmet need. Our team focuses on developing, manufacturing and marketing novel products for use by specialist physicians and healthcare providers to drive improved clinical and health outcomes. We believe that the cost-effectiveness of our products is attractive to our customers.
Since our founding in 2004, we have had a strong track record of organic product development and commercial expansion that has established the foundation of our global organization. We have successfully developed, obtained regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduced products into the neurovascular market since 2007, vascular market since 2013, neurosurgical market since 2014, and immersive healthcare market since 2020. 
We expect to continue to develop and build our portfolio of products, including our thrombectomy, embolization, access and immersive healthcare technologies, while iterating on our currently available products. Generally, when we introduce a next generation product or a new product designed to replace a current product, sales of the earlier generation product or the product replaced decline. Our research and development activities are centered around the development of new products and clinical activities designed to support our regulatory submissions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our products.
We attribute our success to our culture built on cooperation, our highly efficient product innovation process, our disciplined approach to product and commercial development, our deep understanding of our target end markets and our relationships with specialist physicians and healthcare providers. We believe these factors have enabled us to rapidly innovate in a highly efficient manner.
We sell our products to healthcare providers primarily through our direct sales organization in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as through distributors in select international markets. We generated revenue of $747.6 million, $560.4 million and $547.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This represents an annual increase of 33.4% and 2.4%, respectively. We generated operating losses of $7.5 million and $38.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and operating income of $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Our results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to impact our business. While our business falls within the category of healthcare operations, which are essential businesses that have generally been permitted to continue operating during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruptions to our operations as a result of the pandemic. While we have seen positive trends in certain areas of our business beginning in May 2020, we remain mindful of the negative impacts on business trends we experienced in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, hospital resources have been diverted to fight the pandemic, and many government agencies in conjunction with healthcare systems have recommended the deferral of elective and semi-elective medical procedures during the pandemic. The general impact of COVID-19 on our business has been negative and we are unable to reliably predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the global resurgences of cases, particularly as new variants of the virus spread, additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on the business of our customers, distributors and suppliers, other businesses and worldwide economies in general, our ability to have access to our customers to provide training and case support, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
Our Markets
We concentrate on improving treatment outcomes for patients with certain forms of vascular disease and strive to improve the long-term quality of life for patients who could benefit from immersive healthcare applications. Vascular disease refers to any condition that affects the circulatory system and typically manifests as a blockage or rupture of an artery or a vein. When the treatment for vascular disease is performed from within a vessel, it is referred to as an endovascular procedure. Endovascular device markets are conventionally classified according to the anatomic location of the disorder, and are generally divided into neuro, which includes neurovascular and neurosurgical, and vascular, which includes peripheral vascular and cardiovascular. In both of these markets, our main product technologies include thrombectomy devices to remove clots and embolization devices to treat aneurysms and to occlude vessels. Immersive healthcare technology includes applications for patients recovering from or undergoing rehabilitation related to diseases, injuries, or illnesses, as well as applications designed to address mental well-being and cognition. 
We generated revenue of $338.7 million, $292.6 million and $331.7 million from our neuro product category for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated revenue of $408.9 million, $267.8 million, and $215.7 million from our vascular product category for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets novel products, and operates as one operating segment.
While reliable third-party data is not available for many markets outside the United States, we believe there are substantial additional market opportunities for our neuro, vascular and immersive healthcare products throughout the world.
The Neuro Market
The neuro market is comprised of vascular diseases and disorders in the brain, including ischemic stroke, brain aneurysms, hemorrhagic stroke and other conditions. Our solutions address the intervention of these diseases.
 Globally, stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or bursts (ruptures). It is estimated that nearly 14 million strokes occur annually and that there are more than 80 million survivors of stroke globally. In the United States, the American Heart Association (“AHA”) and American Stroke Association (“ASA”) estimate that nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually, and lead to approximately 150,000 deaths per year.
 Some of the more common neurovascular diseases we focus on are:
•Ischemic Stroke: Ischemic strokes, caused by the blockage of an artery in the brain, represent approximately 87% of strokes, or approximately 700,000 patients annually, in the United States. Of these cases, we estimate that approximately 200,000 are treatable with mechanical thrombectomy, which involves removal of the clot causing the blockage by mechanical means and restoring blood flow to the blocked vessels. Outside of the United States, we estimate, based on published sources, that there are approximately 9.7 million ischemic strokes annually and that 1.9 million of these patients are treatable with mechanical thrombectomy. Studies have shown that patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy had improved functional outcomes compared with treatment with clot-busting drugs such as tPA alone. 
•Brain Aneurysm: An aneurysm is a weak area in a blood vessel that usually enlarges and is often described as a “ballooning” of the blood vessel. Approximately 1.5% to 5.0% of the general population has or will develop a brain aneurysm and about 6 million people in the United States may currently have a brain aneurysm. If a patient has had an aneurysm, there is a 15% to 20% likelihood that the patient will have one or more additional aneurysms. The primary endovascular procedure for treating unruptured aneurysms uses a repair technique called embolization, in which the aneurysm is packed with coils in a minimally invasive procedure.
•Hemorrhagic Stroke: Hemorrhagic strokes, caused by the sudden rupture of a brain artery that leads to bleeding into or around the brain, represent approximately 13% of strokes in the United States. Brain aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (“AVM”) can both cause hemorrhagic stroke. According to independent sources, every year 0.5% to 3.0% of people with a brain aneurysm and 1.0% to 3.0% of people with an AVM may suffer from bleeding. According to the AHA and ASA, once a brain aneurysm or an AVM bleeds, the chance of death is 30% to 40% and 10% to 15%, respectively. Intracerebral hemorrhage, a type of hemorrhagic stroke, occurs when a vessel within the brain bursts, allowing blood to leak inside the brain.
In addition to products addressing these specific diseases, our neuro access products address other diseases and potentially broader neuro conditions as well.
The Vascular Market
Vascular diseases are diseases occurring in vessels in the body outside of the brain. Such diseases are very similar to those experienced in the neurovasculature. Just as the disruption of blood flow to the brain has high mortality and morbidity, disruptions in the peripheral vasculature can also have serious adverse consequences. There are approximately 1.4 million incidences of clot in the peripheral vasculature each year in the United States, the vast majority of which do not currently receive mechanical thrombectomy intervention. This includes:
•Peripheral Arterial Occlusion (“PAO”): Acute PAO occurs when a blood clot develops in major peripheral arteries. PAO includes Acute Limb Ischemia (“ALI”), which occurs when the leg has an immediate change because of an occlusion in the artery, which is almost always caused either because a blood clot forms in the artery or because emboli from the heart or other place within the body travels to the extremity and causes an occlusion. We estimate there are approximately 250,000 patients in the United States each year who are treated for ALI.
•Deep Vein Thrombosis (“DVT”): A DVT occurs when a clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg and sometimes in the arm. We estimate that approximately 350,000 patients in the United States each year suffer from iliofemoral or proximal upper extremity DVT.
•Pulmonary Embolism (“PE”): PE is a condition that occurs when blood clots, which typically travel from the veins in the legs, get caught in the lungs. We estimate there are approximately 150,000 patients in the United States who suffer either a high- or intermediate-risk PE, also known as massive or sub massive PEs, respectively.
•Clot associated with Arteriovenous Graft or Fistula: Arteriovenous grafts or fistulas are created for access to dialyze the blood of patients with end-stage renal disease. It is common for clots to form within these access vessels when patients undergo dialysis long-term. 
•Acute Coronary Syndrome: Acute Coronary Syndrome is a term used to describe a variety of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. One such condition is a heart attack (myocardial infarction) — when cell death results in damaged or destroyed heart tissue. These heart attacks can often be associated with high thrombus burden in the coronary arteries. We estimate that there are approximately 200,000 patients each year in the United States suffering from clot in the coronary vasculature that we believe could benefit from aspiration technology.
•Other Vascular Diseases: In addition to products addressing the above diseases and conditions, our peripheral embolization products address other diseases and conditions such as aneurysm, vessel malformations, bleeding, endoleaks, ovarian veins and varicoceles. 
The Immersive Healthcare Market
Immersive healthcare is the use of immersive 3D computer-based technologies to support patient care across a broad spectrum of conditions, including patients recovering from or undergoing physical rehabilitation, and patients with mental well-being and cognition related challenges. Physical rehabilitation can include patients recovering from a range of neuro conditions, including stroke and traumatic brain injury, trauma, sports medicine and other orthopedic conditions. In the case of mental well-being and cognition, patients with a variety of conditions can benefit from distraction, reminiscence, and other therapies to manage symptoms including pain, anxious and depressed moods, age-related challenges, fatigue, and loneliness in a wide range of healthcare settings such as in-hospital settings, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient facilities, senior living facilities and other specialty settings. We estimate there are more than 50 million patients in the United States each year who can benefit from our immersive healthcare products.

Neuro Products
Our neuro products fall into the following broad product families:
Thrombectomy Products
Our Penumbra System brand of products offers a form of mechanical thrombectomy used by specialist physicians to revascularize blood vessels that are blocked by clots in the intracranial vasculature. These products are aspiration-based. The Penumbra System is a fully integrated mechanical thrombectomy system consisting of reperfusion catheters and separators, the 3D Revascularization Device, aspiration tubing, and aspiration pump. 
Penumbra System Reperfusion Catheters are the cornerstone of the Penumbra System and are manufactured using a variety of proprietary processes and materials science innovations for use in revascularization of patients with acute ischemic stroke. 
The Penumbra System Reperfusion Catheters, powered by Penumbra ENGINE or Penumbra Pump MAX, are designed for trackability and to maximize thrombus removal force. We believe these design features contribute to improved clinical outcomes and reduced procedure times. Penumbra System Reperfusion Catheters include the Penumbra RED family, JET family, ACE family and MAX families of catheters, designed to address a broad range of occlusions. 
In 2021, we launched our RED family of catheters, which are designed with the latest innovations in tracking and aspiration technology to navigate complex distal vessel anatomy and deliver powerful aspiration, together with Penumbra ENGINE, for the removal of blood clots in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions.
Designed specifically for use with aspiration technology, the 3D Revascularization Device is a component of the Penumbra System that offers a technologically-advanced structure designed to treat large vessel occlusion in combination with Penumbra RED, JET 7, ACE, and MAX Reperfusion Catheters.
Either Penumbra ENGINE or Penumbra Pump MAX is connected to our reperfusion catheters and provides the aspiration suction force. We developed our proprietary aspiration source as a fully-integrated system specifically for mechanical thrombectomy by aspiration. 
Embolization Products
Penumbra SMART COIL is a family of detachable coils, designed to treat patients with a wide range of neurovascular lesions, including the small and medium sized aneurysms that comprise the majority of the neurovascular coiling market. The design of Penumbra SMART COIL allows the level of softness to be determined not only by the diameter of the platinum filament, but also by a structural component inside the coil itself. This development enables Penumbra SMART COIL to become progressively softer within the span of an individual coil.
Penumbra Coil 400 is a family of detachable coils developed to offer an improved alternative for the treatment of medium to large aneurysms and other larger, more complex lesions. We implemented several proprietary design innovations to enable the coil to maintain shape while achieving biomechanically stable occlusion. Given the size and handling of Penumbra Coil 400, it is able to achieve higher packing density with fewer coils compared to competitive coiling systems. 
Access Products
Most endovascular procedures require access to the diseased area using guidewires and catheters. Accessing the brain through the tortuous neurovasculature has been a substantial challenge for physicians treating vascular disorders in the brain. Companies that developed catheters and other products for neurovascular applications historically leveraged technologies developed for use in coronary or peripheral vascular interventions. This approach created challenges given the vastly different anatomy, structure and sizing of the neurovascular vessels. 
The Neuron family of guide catheters and the Penumbra distal delivery catheters (“DDC”) enable many endovascular procedures in the tortuous anatomy of the neurovasculature. The Neuron delivery catheter is a variable stiffness guide catheter with increased support in the aortic arch, easier access, and trackability into the intracranial vasculature. The design of Neuron enables physicians to position the catheter much higher in the anatomy than conventional guide catheters. 
The BENCHMARK catheter features additional improvements in aortic arch support, ease-of-use, and trackability. In addition to improved proximal support in the arch through multi-geometry metal reinforcement, the distal tip is softer and more trackable, while maintaining distal shaft radiopacity for improved visualization. The BENCHMARK also is available pre-packaged with a Select catheter to obviate the need for a neurovascular guide catheter exchange, which may reduce the number of devices needed per procedure and shorten procedure times.
 The BENCHMARK family includes our BENCHMARK BMX 96 Access System, which provides a larger internal diameter without increasing the outer diameter of the delivery catheter, enabling more working room for all neurovascular procedures while maintaining the same size access site as our Neuron MAX.
Neurosurgical Tools
Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device leverages our expertise in thrombectomy and access to offer a minimally invasive approach to surgical removal of fluid and tissue from the ventricles and cerebrum. The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device works with a neuroendoscope through a sheath to access hematomas. Together with the Penumbra Pump MAX aspiration source, Artemis offers powerful and controlled hematoma evacuation.
Vascular Products
The peripheral vasculature presents unique challenges that differ from the neurovasculature. Many peripheral arteries and veins are significantly larger than those found in the brain and therefore have higher blood flow rates and larger clot burden. More importantly, they must be able to accommodate larger pressure gradients and sustain structural integrity despite substantial movement and flexing of the organs and musculature that surround them. Imaging can also be more challenging as physicians have to view their equipment through many more layers of organs and tissue than in the brain. The coronary vasculature also presents unique challenges.
 Our vascular products fall into the following broad product families:
Thrombectomy
Indigo System
The Indigo System was designed for continuous aspiration mechanical thrombectomy, leveraging the success of the Penumbra System in ischemic stroke. It is an easy to use thrombectomy system that is powerful, highly trackable, and suited to a wide range of clot morphology in the peripheral arterial, peripheral venous, pulmonary arteries and coronary vasculature. The Indigo System is comprised of three principal components:
•Continuous Aspiration Mechanical Thrombectomy Catheters are robust, durable, trackable and suited for the peripheral and coronary anatomy. We have introduced multiple sizes of catheters for use in both the peripheral and coronary vasculature. CAT Catheters are available in a wide range of sizes and lengths to address a wide range of vessel sizes and clot locations. Lightning, our next generation aspiration system for peripheral thrombectomy, combines the CAT 7 and 12 Aspiration Catheters with Lightning Intelligent Aspiration, enabling physicians to focus on optimizing thrombus removal using the system’s unique clot detection mechanism while helping to mitigate blood loss for arterial and venous applications including the treatment of pulmonary embolism. 
•Indigo Separators are advanced and retracted through the aspiration catheter at the proximal margin of the primary occlusion to facilitate clearing of the thrombus from the catheter tip. In the peripheral vasculature, clots often form in long segments and are more resistant to traditional aspiration techniques. The Indigo System with the Separator enables a practitioner to remove a wide range of clot morphology from both peripheral and coronary vasculature. 
•Penumbra ENGINE or Penumbra Pump MAX is connected to our CAT catheters and provides the aspiration suction force. We developed our proprietary aspiration source as a fully-integrated system specifically for mechanical thrombectomy by vacuum aspiration. 
Embolization
Ruby Coil System
The Ruby Coil System consists of detachable coils that are specifically designed for peripheral applications. Ruby Coils have a controlled mechanical detachment mechanism that permits the physician to deliver and reposition the coil until the final satisfactory position is reached before detachment. 
The Ruby Coil System is used in a variety of clinical applications, including, but not limited to: 
•active extravasations, or the escape of blood into surrounding tissue; 
•selective embolization in patients with visceral aneurysms; 
•exclusion of branches prior to chemoembolization and radioembolization; 
•embolization in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding; 
•embolization of branches prior to stent graft procedures; 
•procedures after stent grafting in patients with persistent type II endoleaks and sac enlargement; 
•treatment of patients with varicocele and pelvic congestion syndrome; 
•high-flow arterial venous malformations; 
•post trans intrahepatic shunt placement; 
•balloon retrograde transvenous obliteration; and 
•exclusion of hepatic branches prior to liver resection. 
LANTERN
The Penumbra LANTERN Delivery Microcatheter is a low-profile microcatheter with a high-flow lumen that enables large-volume coil delivery. LANTERN features a radiopaque distal shaft for enhanced visibility and dual distal marker bands for precise coil deployment in tortuous anatomy.
POD (Penumbra Occlusion Device) System
POD addresses a specific need in the peripheral embolization market to rapidly and precisely occlude a target vessel, including in high-flow situations. Our POD device utilizes technology that delivers both variable sizing and variable softness to provide a single device solution for rapid and precise embolization of the target vessel. The technology achieves this range of features through the design of a distal anchoring segment, thereby immediately anchoring the device in a range of vessel diameters. The proximal segment of the POD achieves dense occlusion by packing a softer, smaller diameter segment tightly behind the anchored portion. 
The Packing Coil is a complementary device for use with our other peripheral embolization products. It is uniquely designed to pack densely behind Ruby Coils and POD to occlude arteries and veins throughout the peripheral vasculature including aneurysms. Both POD and Packing Coil are detached instantly with a sterile detachment handle. 
Immersive Healthcare Platform
The REAL Immersive System is a proprietary, immersive 3D computer-based technology platform that has the potential to benefit patients over a broad range of healthcare applications, including rehabilitation, mental well-being and cognition. This technology builds on our experience with neuro and vascular medical device innovation and was initially commercialized for conducting upper body rehabilitation in a clinical setting. Studies have shown that adding virtual reality therapy to conventional therapy is effective in improving patient engagement and outcomes, particularly with systems that are fully immersive, customized for the healthcare setting, and fun and engaging for patients. In the third quarter of 2021, we expanded the REAL System offering, introducing the REAL i-Series, which features a virtual reality-enabled headset with intuitive gaze navigation and exclusive experiences and activities designed to address mental well-being and cognition. We intend to continue to pursue healthcare applications where our immersive 3D computer-based technology platform can improve the quality of life of patients with a variety of conditions.
Research and Development 
Our research and development team has a track record of product innovation and significant product improvements. Since inception, we have introduced multiple brands in either the United States, international markets, or both. 
We believe our ability to rapidly develop innovative products is in large part attributable to the fully integrated product innovation process that we have implemented, and the management philosophy behind that process. In addition, we have recruited and retained engineers with a variety of backgrounds and experience to support the development of innovative therapies. Substantially all of our research and development efforts are based at our campus in Alameda, California.
Manufacturing
We currently maintain our manufacturing facilities in Alameda and Roseville, California and currently produce substantially all of our products in-house. Our manufacturing facilities are International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 compliant. We received ISO 13485:2016 certification of our Alameda facility in 2018 and successfully completed our most recent re-certification in 2021. We received ISO 13485:2016 certification of our Roseville facility in 2020. In 2007, our Quality Management System (“QMS”) was first audited to the European Union’s Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) in support of product CE marking, and we successfully completed our most recent re-certification in 2021. We have elected to participate in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) which allows for certification and review of compliance to standards and regulations required in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Australia, and Japan by a single auditing organization. We received our first MDSAP certification in 2018 and successfully completed our most recent re-certification in 2021.
We use annual internal audits to ensure strong quality control practices. An internal, on-going staff training and education program contributes to our quality assurance program; training is documented and considered part of the employee evaluation process.
We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs. However, there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto, particularly where provided by a single supplier, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. In an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply, we work closely with 
suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We also utilize long-term supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases. Where possible, we seek second source suppliers or suppliers that have alternate manufacturing sites at which they could manufacture our parts. 
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products directly in the United States, most of Europe, Canada and Australia, subject to required regulatory clearances and approvals. We have complemented our direct sales organization with distributors in most international markets.
We currently sell our products in the United States through our dedicated salesforce in our major markets, neuro, vascular, and immersive healthcare. Our sales representatives and sales managers generally have substantial medical device experience and market our products directly to a variety of specialist physicians engaged in the treatment of vascular disorders and healthcare providers who manage patients addressing motor function, cognition and mental well-being, who are the end users of our products and significantly influence buying decisions in hospitals and other healthcare settings relating to medical devices and other healthcare products. We are focused on developing strong relationships with specialist physicians and other healthcare providers and devote significant resources to training and educating physicians and other healthcare providers in the use and benefits of our products. The principal specialist physicians and other healthcare providers in our target end markets include:
•Neuro: Interventional neuroradiologists, neurosurgeons, and interventional neurologists.
•Vascular: Interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional cardiologists. 
•Immersive Healthcare: Occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, mental health professionals and other healthcare providers.
In addition to our direct sales organizations, we work with distributors in certain geographic areas where we have determined that selling through distributors is likely to be more effective.
We have continued licensing the technology to certain of our products to our partner in China pursuant to the distribution and licensing agreement entered into in December 2020, which permits our partner to manufacture and commercialize such products in China in exchange for fixed payments upon the transfer of the licensed technology and upon the provision of related regulatory support, as well as royalty payments on downstream sales of the licensed products. We believe this arrangement will allow us to monetize our technology while helping us to mitigate market risk.
Our direct sales have been, and we anticipate will continue to represent, a majority of our revenues. In 2021, direct sales accounted for approximately 83% of our revenue, with the balance generated by independent distributors that sell our products outside of the United States and by the arrangement with our partner in China, which includes licensing royalty and distribution revenue.
Backlog 
We typically accept and ship orders on the day purchase orders are received or the next business day. Furthermore, if requested, we generally permit customers to cancel or reschedule without penalty. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is material, nor is it a reliable indication of future revenue. 
Reimbursement
In the United States, hospitals are the primary purchasers of our products. Hospitals in turn bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans, for the total healthcare services required to treat the patient. Government agencies and some other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and to reimburse hospitals for inpatient treatment at a fixed rate based on the Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”) as determined by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The fixed rate of reimbursement is generally based on the patients’ diagnosis and the procedure performed, and is unrelated to the specific medical device used in that procedure. Medicare rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. Private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies. While some may look to coverage and payment by Medicare as a guide, most formulate their own coverage and payment policies.
Some payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary, not cost-effective, or used for a non-approved indication. We cannot assure you that government or private third-party payors will cover 
and reimburse the procedures performed using our products in whole or in part in the future, that payment rates will be adequate, or that reimbursement rates will not change in the future.
Outside the United States, market acceptance of medical devices depends partly upon the availability of reimbursement within the prevailing healthcare payment system. Reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. A small number of countries may require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so. 
The increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in international markets will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, medical device reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under healthcare payment systems in such markets. 
All third-party reimbursement programs, whether government funded or insured commercially, whether in the United States or internationally, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, second opinions required prior to major surgery, review and analysis of claims, encouragement of and incentives for maintaining healthier lifestyles, and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care. These types of programs and legislative or regulatory changes to reimbursement policies could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. 
Competition 
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of neuro and vascular medical devices. Our most notable competitors are Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Inari, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Stryker and Terumo. Most of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with longer operating histories and greater resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. For example, in 2021 some of these competitors acquired technologies that compete with our products in the vascular market. We also compete with a number of smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have: 
•significantly greater name recognition; 
•broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers, group purchasing organizations, and third-party payors; 
•more established distribution networks; 
•additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage; 
•greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and 
•greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation. 
We compete primarily on the basis that our products are able to treat patients with neuro and vascular diseases and disorders and other health conditions safely and effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to: 
•develop innovative, proprietary products that can cost-effectively address significant clinical needs; 
•continue to innovate and develop scientifically advanced technology; 
•obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals; 
•demonstrate efficacy in Penumbra-sponsored and third-party clinical trials and studies; 
•apply technology across product lines and markets; 
•attract and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and 
•cost-effectively manufacture and successfully market and sell products. 
The immersive healthcare market is an emerging field within healthcare which is gaining increasing attention. There are a number of other companies that are also pursuing virtual reality-based healthcare solutions which have engaging therapeutic content activities. We believe that market success for us or any of our competitors in the immersive healthcare industry will be determined by virtual reality-based healthcare solutions becoming more widely accepted in the marketplace and the ability to design purpose-built virtual reality hardware and software specifically for use in healthcare.
 Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property and operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We do not have any material licenses to any technology or intellectual property rights. 
As of December 31, 2021, we owned and/or had rights to 85 issued patents globally, of which 36 were U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and/or had rights to 75 pending patent applications, of which 35 were patent applications pending in the United States. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, 16 of our issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2025 and 2026; 13 of these patents relate to components of the Penumbra System and the Indigo System. Twenty-seven of our issued patents, which relate to components of the Penumbra Coil 400, Ruby Coil System and Smart Coil System, are currently expected to expire between 2029 and 2037. Fifteen patents pertaining to the 3D Revascularization Device are projected to expire between 2032 and 2034. Thirteen patents related to our REAL Immersive System are expected to expire in 2036. Some of our pending patent applications pertain to components and methods of use associated with currently commercialized products. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products or provide us with any competitive advantage. See the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information.
Additionally, we own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that are used in our business and in conjunction with the sale of our products, including 31 U.S. trademark registrations and 130 foreign trademark registrations as of December 31, 2021. Included in the registered trademarks is a mark with our company name and logo.
We also seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of other methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. 
Government Regulation
Our medical devices are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States and comparable authorities in other countries under other statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, handling of patient data and information clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, pricing and discounts, post-marketing surveillance and interactions with healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 
United States
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior premarket notification (or 510(k)) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a premarket approval (“PMA”) from FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed 
to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the FD&C Act, such as provisions that relate to adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to FDA a premarket notification requesting clearance to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Medical devices which pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining or life-supporting devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are Class III devices. In general a Class III device must receive FDA approval of a PMA application before it can be marketed in the United States. However, there are some Class III devices for which FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a premarket notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner. 
510(k) Clearance Pathway 
When a 510(k) clearance is required, a premarket notification must be submitted to FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to FDA and receive 510(k) clearance from FDA before the device can be marketed in the United States. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments (“MDUFA”) performance goal for a traditional 510(k) clearance is 90 calendar days. As a practical matter, however, clearance often takes longer, because the review clock is paused by FDA to allow time to resolve any questions they may have on the 510(k) file. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the premarket notification demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness. FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, FDA will place the device into Class III, subject to the applicant’s option to submit a De Novo request for FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device into Class I or II.
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are appropriate for certain technological, design, and labeling changes to a device which necessitates a new 510(k) but where the method(s) to evaluate the change(s) are well-established, and whether the results can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
Premarket Approval Pathway 
A PMA application under section 515 of the FD&C Act must be submitted to FDA for Class III devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).
After a PMA application is submitted, FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether FDA will file the application for review. FDA has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). FDA also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations. 
Upon completion of the PMA application review, FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months 
or even years; or (iv) deny the PMA application. If FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which FDA’s review clock is reset. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”), at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. We, FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 
Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. 
Ongoing Regulation by FDA 
Even after a device receives clearance or approval by FDA and is placed on the market in the United States, there are requirements and regulations that must be followed. These include: 
•establishment registration and device listing; 
•QSR per 21 CFR Part 820 of U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”), which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations and prohibitions against product adulteration and misbranding (e.g., the promotion of products that do not have the appropriate market clearance or promotion for “off-label” uses), and other requirements related to promotional activities;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
•corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and 
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or Class III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If FDA disagrees with our determination to not seek a new 510(k) clearance, FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. FDA could also require us to cease marketing and 
distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, there may be significant regulatory fines and penalties. 
Changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, with the exception that the supplement is generally limited to the information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. 
FDA regulations require us to register our manufacturing facilities as a medical device manufacturer. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”) requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, FDA and the CDHS may inspect our facilities on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular QSR inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Further, FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions: 
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products; 
•withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and 
•criminal prosecution. 
The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Our approach has been to file such reports with FDA even in cases where reporting might not otherwise be required out of an abundance of caution. In addition, FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution. 
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our medical devices under development. 
We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory, and manufacturing practices. 
Regulatory Inspections 
We are subject to periodic inspections by FDA and other regulatory entities, such as a European Notified Body, related to the regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured, and clinical trials sponsored, by us. When FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or FDA Form 483. If a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies is received from FDA following an inspection, we would be required to respond in writing, and would be required to undertake corrective and/or preventive or other actions in order to address FDA’s or other regulators’ concerns. Failure to address FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions. 
European Union 
Our medical devices are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the European Union Directive (93/42/EEC), also known as the Medical Device Directive (the “MDD”). An authorized third party, also called a Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking, other than those which are categorized as class I self-certified. The CE mark is contingent 
upon continued compliance to the applicable regulations, harmonized standards and the quality system requirements of the MDD and the ISO 13485 standard.
The new European Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 (“EU MDR”), which was published in May 2017 with a transition period of three years, replaced the MDD and was initially scheduled to be fully implemented on May 26, 2020, with no further applications under the previous directives permitted and therefore requiring that we update our quality management system processes to meet the new EU MDR requirements. On April 17, 2020, the European Parliament postponed the implementation of EU MDR by 12 months in response to the exceptional circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and EU MDR came into effect on May 26, 2021. We have updated our quality management system processes to meet the new EU MDR requirements, which were successfully audited in April 2021 by a Notified Body. We are actively updating technical documentation supporting our medical devices to meet EU MDR requirements and have submitted and obtained our first approval for the Indigo system. We are also working with a Notified Body on the timing of each Technical Documentation submission and review under EU MDR. Under EU MDR, CE certificates issued under the previous directives prior to May 2021 will remain valid in accordance with their term beyond the expiration of the transition period, but will become void at the latest on May 27, 2024; however, certain limitations set forth in EU MDR, such as the inability to substantially change medical devices without notified body approval will apply. We do not expect such limitations to have any material impact on our ability to supply our medical devices to the market in the region covered by EU MDR.
Other Regions 
Most major markets have different levels of regulatory requirements for medical devices. Modifications to the cleared or approved products may require a new regulatory submission in all major markets. The regulatory requirements, and the review time, vary significantly from country to country. 
Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation
Anti-Kickback Statute 
We are subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. 
There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the anti-kickback statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar laws and regulations. 
Federal Civil False Claims Act. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain 
payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. As a result, qui tam actions continue to cause healthcare companies to have to defend cases brought under the federal civil False Claims Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government. 
Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
Sunshine Act. The Affordable Care Act also included a provision, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, that requires any manufacturer of a covered device that provides payments or other transfers of value to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the request of a physician or teaching hospital, to submit to CMS on an annual basis information about the payments or other transfers of value, with the reported information to be made public on a searchable website. Such reporting requirement was expanded by the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which requires manufacturers, beginning January 1, 2021, to report payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives in addition to physicians and teaching hospitals. Similar laws have been enacted at the state level and in foreign jurisdictions, including France. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Anti-Bribery Laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of securing a business advantage. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. Similar anti-bribery laws are in effect in many of the countries in which we operate. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). Among other things, HITECH created four tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 3,800 employees worldwide. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Some of our employees outside of the United States are subject to mandatory, industry-specific collective bargaining agreements or the protections of statutory works councils as required by local law. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good. During 2021, we made a number of hires at the senior management level, including relating to our REAL Immersive System and our international sales operations, which we believe will help drive growth in those areas.
In managing our business, we focus on a number of measures and objectives with respect to the attraction, development and retention of our employees that we believe are important to our business, including diversity, communication, compensation, professional development, and health, well-being and safety:
•We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer and to have a diverse employee population and leadership team: for example, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of our employees are female, almost half of our senior management team are female, and almost 75% of our employee population in the United States are from a minority 
background. We seek to attract a diverse slate of candidates, including from historically underrepresented groups. We believe that diversity and inclusion in the workplace enhance employee engagement and stimulate innovation, and that people in diverse groups work better, share information more broadly and consider a wider range of views. We pride ourselves on our diverse workforce, which we believe has been and will continue to be a major contributor to our growth and innovation, and intend to continue to make diversity and inclusion a cornerstone of our efforts regarding our workforce.
•We aim to maintain an “open door” culture, and encourage employees to voice their concerns, questions, suggestions and comments. We strive to foster an atmosphere where employees openly share ideas and where people are treated with dignity and respect. Our goal is to provide a productive working environment based on mutual respect and the highest level of ethical and lawful conduct. We have also established a hotline for employees to report suspected violations of law and concerns related to accounting, auditing and ethical violations.
•We provide our employees a competitive wage that is aimed to allow them to meet the standard cost of living in their region. We evaluate our compensation programs to ensure that our employees are paid fairly for the valuable work they are doing, and we are rewarding outstanding performance. We are also committed to achieving internal pay equity. We offer our employees competitive benefits that follow local country standards. 
•We aim to foster a culture where learning is continuous, and we strive to promote from within. We believe in our people and their ability to accept new responsibilities and challenges and to grow with us to contribute to our success. Growth is fostered through professional development and learning programs as well as practical experience leading projects or teams. Employees receive regular performance reviews to support their progress and development.
•We recognize the benefits of a healthy workforce. We provide employees at our Alameda campus with an on-site restaurant that offers fresh food at discounted pricing for employees, as well as an on-site fitness center, which has been closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with local and state health guidelines, with online fitness classes being offered to employees during the closure. Employees in the United States are also eligible for a gym discount at a local commercial fitness chain. We also support the mental health of our employees by offering an employee assistance program for employees and their families. that provides free counseling sessions and offers other resources for employees.
•We prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Guided by a strategic plan that is regularly reviewed, we have a dedicated Employee Health and Safety team, who seek to prevent and reduce workplace risks and injuries through various programs, projects, services, and assistance, such as ergonomic evaluation, hazard reporting, risk assessment, and first aid training. Employee safety is also supported by an access control system at all facilities and a dedicated 24/7 Security team on the Alameda and Roseville campuses. We require all work-related injuries or illnesses to be reported. This information is reviewed monthly by our Safety Committee for analysis and trending. 
•We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety of our employees and our workplace. For example, we have taken a number of steps to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, including continuing to pay United States employees impacted by the pandemic consistent with California Requirements, avoiding layoffs, permitting most of our office employees to work remotely, providing periodic on-site vaccine and booster clinics and on-site testing, and implementing changes to how we manufacture our products and to other processes in order to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and to operate under the protocols mandated by local and state authorities, with measures such as changes to shift schedules, physical distancing, contact tracing, symptom assessments and other safety measures. We will continue to assess, identify and implement measures to support the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic.
Facilities
We maintain approximately 500,000 square feet of office, research and development, manufacturing and administrative facilities in nine buildings at our campus in Alameda, California as of December 31, 2021. The leases for these nine buildings expire at various times in 2029 to 2036, subject to our option to renew certain leases for an additional five to fifteen years. From time to time through February 1, 2035, if any space in any of the buildings located in the same business park as our campus becomes vacant, that space will be added to the lease. The maximum additional space that could be added under this provision of the lease as of December 31, 2021 is approximately 100,000 square feet. The Company has a right of first offer to lease any space that becomes available after such date. We also lease approximately 160,000 square feet of manufacturing facility in Roseville, California. The lease for this building expires in 2034, subject to our option to renew the lease for an additional five to ten years. In addition, we lease approximately 70,000 square feet of warehouse space in Livermore, California, and approximately 45,000 square feet of warehouse space in Salt Lake City, Utah. The leases for the Livermore warehouse spaces 
expire at various times in 2025 to 2028. The lease for the Salt Lake City warehouse expires in 2024, subject to our option to renew the lease for an additional three to nine years.
During the third quarter of 2021, we signed the 620 Roseville Parkway Lease which had not yet commenced as of December 31, 2021. Per the terms of the lease, improvements will be constructed and permanently affixed to the property in phases, the first of which phase is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2022.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired Sixense, which leases an aggregate of approximately 8,000 square feet of office space in Los Gatos, San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. The leases for these offices expire at various times in 2022 to 2023, with the Los Angeles office automatically renewing on a quarterly basis until terminated. In addition, Sixense leases office space in Israel, which supports its research and development activities.
We also lease office and warehouse space in Germany, Italy, Australia, Brazil, and Singapore as of December 31, 2021. The offices in Germany and Australia support our direct sales operations in Europe and Australasia, respectively, with the Germany office also supporting distributor relationships in Europe and the Middle East; the offices in Brazil and Singapore support our sales and marketing efforts, including through our distribution partners, in Latin America and Southeast Asia, respectively; and the offices in Italy support the operations of Crossmed S.p.A., our wholly-owned subsidiary in Italy, including supporting our direct sales operations in Italy, San Marino, Vatican City, and Switzerland. We also warehouse and distribute finished products to our international customers utilizing a third-party logistics provider in the Netherlands.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to claims and assessments in the ordinary course of business. For more information regarding our current legal proceedings, please refer to the section entitled “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and there can be no assurance that legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
