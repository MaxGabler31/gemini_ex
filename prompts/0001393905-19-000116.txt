  ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS
  Trutankless Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and currently operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on December 3, 2009.  Trutankless is involved in sales, marketing, research and development of a high quality, whole-house, smart electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. Management anticipates the Company's trutankless water heater, with Wi-Fi capability and trutankless' proprietary apps offered in the iOS and Android store, will augment existing products in the hope automation space.  Overview of Potential Markets and Summary of Marketing Plan
  Management intends to focus on the United States residential market initially. For decades Americans have used only tank type water heaters. For most homes, the units hold an average of 40 to 80 gallons of water in a storage tank, are gas or electric fueled and consume excessive energy to keep water hot continuously. In fact, water heaters expend up to 25% of the total energy used by a typical household representing the second largest use of energy in most homes. Depending on household usage, approximately 25 - 50% of the heat created is lost through the walls of the tank and connecting pipes.  There are other problems inherent with traditional tank water heaters:  · Due to the high temperatures and corrosive aspects of water, a typical water heater has a lifespan of 10.7 years. · Unless replaced beforehand, more than two thirds of water heaters eventually corrode and leak or burst, often resulting in extensive and costly water and mold related damage. · Due to the large size and other installation requirements often result in the units being installed in garages and utility rooms on the opposite side of the home from the bathroom fixtures. Because of this, an estimated 10,000 gallons of water per household goes down the drain while users wait on the water to get hot at the faucet.   1      · Traditional tank water heaters take up to 6 to 9 square feet of floor space, which can be especially valuable in multi-family or commercial applications. · To reduce operating costs, many people adjust the temperature on their water heaters down. Unfortunately, lower temperatures increase the possibility of unhealthy, waterborne bacteria growth. · To increase water heating capacity, many people will adjust the temperature of their water heaters up. In addition to using more energy, this practice can be dangerous by posing a greater risk of scalding. · Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular in America because they: · Produce a continuous, unlimited supply of hot water · Expend only the energy needed to heat the water used with no standby energy loss · Can last more than twice as long as tank heaters · Are small and require very little space. · Are not conducive to bacterial growth · Are considered very green by green conscious builders and consumers.  Electric tankless water heaters have additional benefits over gas powered models because they can be installed almost anywhere in a home (closets, attics, utility rooms, etc.) where hot water is needed which improves flexibility of floor plan design for builders, architects, and remodelers. In addition, gas tankless water heaters may not be suitable for many applications due to challenges with adequate fuel supply, the need for exhaust vents with specific requirements, and other code-related requirements. In spite of these issues, gas tankless water heaters have enjoyed significant growth in North America because of the efficiency and performance they provide.  Home Automation Overview
  Key trends in the home automation space, which is estimated to reach $46.22 Billion worldwide by 2025, have been driven by consumers desire for efficiency and lifestyle improvements. Companies like Nest have helped to introduce the Internet of Things to appliances with a direct impact on how users interact with traditional household appliances and have the ability to reduce energy usage. The trend towards integration with voice assistants is also on the rise with key industry leaders like Alexa and Google Assistant playing larger roles in the home automation industry. Insurance and utility companies have joined this trend by partnering with home automation manufacturers by leveraging different devices to build insurance products including discounts and rebates. While home security and safety monitoring are expected to continue to dominate the overall market, management anticipates energy management and HVAC controls and monitors will be one of the fastest growing markets in the U.S. which accounts for 36% of global demand.    2      Trutankless replaces an archaic technology which is second to HVAC in home energy consumption, and combined with Wi-Fi capabilities, the system can not only save energy it has the ability to inform users and property owners of energy use, water use, and potential issues like leaks or other failures in the plumbing system. Management plans to roll out additional technologies in the future that can integrate with the Company's trutankless smart apps. Currently, the product has the ability to notify homeowners in the event of water flow while the system is set in away mode. Leak detection, leak damage mitigation, and hot water recirculation for instant hot water at the point of use are becoming major trends in the home automation space. Management believes new products can be introduced into its growing wholesale network to augment trutankless' momentum and harness growing trends to a fresh audience of plumbing and other home service professionals.  Homebuilders and plumbing companies have begun selling homes with more technology integrations. Lennar Homes for example, the nation's largest homebuilder, just recently announced the world's first Wi-Fi Certified communities and employs Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. Trutankless has also been introduced into Lennar communities, and management expects that trutankless products will share Wi-Fi Certification as well as integration with Alexa's voice command capabilities, among other improvements to its existing technology platform.  Tankless Industry Overview
  The U.S. gas tankless, whole-house, water heater market is dominated by five brands; Noritz, Rinnai, Takagi, Aqua Star by Bosch and Rheem by Paloma. The U.S. electric tankless water heater market is dominated by four companies; Stiebel-Eltron, Rheem (Eemax/EcoSmart), Seisco by Microtherm, Inc., and Power Star by Bosch. Until just a few years ago, there were only a few tankless water heater manufacturers with a presence in the United States, but that is changing. Now, several Japanese and European manufacturers have begun marketing products in the United States, and since 2003, gas tankless products have experienced dramatic growth. Electric tankless systems have not experienced comparable growth due to several factors, primarily product performance, capacity, product quality and electrical power supply and installation issues.  Manufacturers of tank heaters have a competitive advantage due largely to their product categories long established use, name recognition, established distribution and brand position in the marketplace. Many plumbers and other building industry professionals were opposed to changing brands or to tankless systems because many tankless water heaters have been poorly designed in the past. As a result there is a perception among some contractors that these water heaters are more complicated and generally less dependable than traditional tank heaters. This perception is often passed along to consumers when making buying decisions or inquiring about switching to a tankless water heater. In recent years however, the industry has experienced a contraction in sales of products and services for new building projects. Consequently, higher ticket, higher margin products, such as tankless and solar water heating systems have become a primary growth driver for many plumbers and companies who had traditionally avoided emerging technologies.  3      While we believe that our products will have superior performance, such as endless hot water, superior longevity, greater efficiency and lower life-cycle costs than traditional tank water heaters, the Companys success will depend to a large degree on the successful conversion of traditional water heater buyers to tankless water heater buyers. The acquisition price of tankless water heaters (both gas and electric) is greater than traditional tank water heaters, but the overall cost of ownership will be less than that of traditional tank technologies under typical circumstances. Although the publics awareness of tankless systems has not been strong historically, sales growth in the sector is suggestive of increasing awareness.  Our marketing and promotion plans have been developed to increase the awareness of the Companys brand as the preferred option to traditional tank systems. Trutankless intends to position itself and its brand to capitalize on the paradigm shift to green-conscious living and development.  Trutankless® Products
  We manufacture and distribute trutankless® water heaters, a line of new, high-quality, highly efficient electric tankless water heaters. Our trutankless® water heaters are engineered to outperform and outlast both its tank and tankless predecessors in energy efficiency, output, and durability.

A partial listing of wholesalers may be found on our website (www.trutankless.com).  Our trutankless® water heaters are designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products are capable of higher temperature rise than competitive units at given flow rates because of its improved design and greater efficiency. Our trutankless® water heaters can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. Generally, a typical tank water heater lasts about 9 years, whereas gas tankless systems may last longer, but requires more routine maintenance. Our product line is designed to last longer than tank water heaters without any routine maintenance required under most conditions.  We created a custom heat exchanger for our trutankless® product line that utilizes our patented technology to heat water as it flows through the system, which means customers need not worry about running out of hot water. We believe weve selected the best materials available and a collection of exclusive design elements and features to maximize capacity, minimize energy use, and provide a truly maintenance free experience.  Our trutankless® water heaters were officially launched in the first quarter of 2014 and is sold throughout the wholesale plumbing distribution channel.

Intellectual Property & Proprietary Rights
  We regard substantial elements of our brands and underlying intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect them by relying on trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and transferring title and other methods.  Our plans are to actively pursue patent and trademark protection for all of newly developed products, both domestically and abroad. We have novel and proprietary technologies related to our product line and the central focus of our patent counsel has been successfully building a defensible portfolio of patent claims which have been granted.  7      To date, we have filed and received a United States federal trademark registration for trutankless® and our logo design with the help of our outside marketing and branding experts and have acquired several unique domain registrations reflective of our online marketing strategy (www.Trutankless.com). During the year ended December 31, 2013, our patent agent filed a provisional patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office with the US Patent and Trademark Office with 37 claims based on our prototype design. Upon completion of our engineered prototype, we filed additional patents with additional claims. We have been able to obtain a formal patent for our tankless water heater with a total of 34 individual and dependent claims. We will continue to protect our intellectual property through confidentiality agreements with vendors and consultants and trade secret protocols employed by employees, consultants, and contractors.  Growth Strategy
  Trutankless product launched in the first quarter of 2014 and is sold through the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. Gas tankless manufacturers support of this sales channel was critical in their ability to quickly capture appreciable market share in the $3.6 billion replacement market. No electric tankless has been available solely through wholesale distributors which have welcomed the arrival of trutankless. Trutankless sales and service training programs geared towards plumbers and contractors are the primary focal point of the Companys sales strategy. Trutankless is employing several outside manufacturers rep agencies to quickly scale sales and educate distributors, plumbers, builders, and contractors.  The Company is also leveraging online marketing strategies and social media. By continually building an immersive and educational web experience at www.trutankless.com. Trutankless is efficiently building brand awareness among consumers. Launch efforts are focused in Arizona, Texas, and the Southeast which accounts for over 1,000,000 electric water heater shipments annually. Licensing and co-branding opportunities are being assessed, since strategic partnerships would eliminate the channel conflicts that have historically obstructed previous electric tankless entries in the marketplace. Electric tankless category competitors have traditionally been unable to obtain partnership household brand names because of generally poor manufacturing quality and product support. In the future we may pursue co-branding opportunities to accelerate sales of Trutankless products through retail channels.  In addition, we have determined that as part of our growth strategy, we will seek to partner with or acquire entities operating in various fields, with a bias towards green and "clean-tech" sectors. Our management has experience in marketing, product launches, business development strategies, and certain other areas specific to the success of growth companies. We will operate with a view towards identifying acquisition candidates as we seek the rights to provide the market with products and services geared toward environmental responsibility, innovative technology in the plumbing industry, and home automation technology.  We have identified several agents who are well suited to provide consulting to high-growth technology and consumer products companies. We are currently negotiating with several agents possessing technical expertise related to planning, structuring, and capitalizing growth companies in the green and "clean-tech" sectors who will be tasked with creating additional revenues and assist the Company with our own planning, structure, and capitalization.  8      We have identified several entities that fit one or more of our criteria. We are focused on adding value to these companies and acquiring either the entity or its business, maintaining and growing that business, and hiring and utilizing existing management where appropriate. We have begun the design of a website which we believe will help us attract relationships with possible acquisition targets.  Margin Expansion
  Cost reduction measures, including outsourcing of key components and certain quality control testing protocols, are currently being undertaken on an expedited basis to rapidly reduce costs and improve manufacturing scalability. Such reductions are expected to take place in stages over the next three quarters and are likely to result in gross sales margins approaching 50% or more, which is far higher than other commodity-heavy technologies, and companies in the sector with mature technologies.  Market Outlook
  Trutankless entered the market in front of the largest water heater replacement cycle ever at a time when homeowners are seeking ways to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing comfort. Additionally, statistics have shown a trend towards electric water heating in new construction markets. Florida, Texas, and Arizona, and areas where electric water heaters dominate the market, have been epicenters of the residential new construction strength in the US. In the new construction market, builders are increasingly marketing green features and trutankless fit well along with other energy saving innovations.  In commercial markets, projects with a green designation like LEED or EnergyStar recently became the majority. We feel that our commercial line of trutankless products are well suited to thousands of customers in the retail, quick serve and fast casual restaurants, hair salons, education. In addition to residential new construction and replacement markets, we feel the commercial applications for which our products are appropriate represent a large portion of the commercial water heater market.  Additionally, the Federal Government mandated that standard electric water heaters over 55 gallons may not be sold (started in April 2015), effectively forcing the market to use alternative technologies like tankless water heaters.  Investment Analysis
  Trutankless has entered the market with a disruptive product that has enjoyed significant trend towards tankless water heating to displace gas tankless water heaters thus far. As a result of the market share growth of gas tankless, we believe TKLS is poised to produce exceptional results in the significant electric water heating market. Management has plans to significantly reduce the cost of goods sold and develop other innovations to supplement existing offerings which will be sold through the existing sales channels and reps which to help ensure sustainable growth over the next 3-5 years.   9     Recent Developments
  On March 21, 2017, we announced our exclusive partnership with Mr. Rooter®.  On April 4, 2017, we announced that our trutankless line of smart electric tankless water heaters is the exclusive water heating solution for luxury communities built by the award -winning Arizona home builder Cullum Homes.  On April 11, 2017, we announced that our trutankless line of smart water heaters has been chosen for both a retrofit project and new construction of townhomes at Friendship Village, a retirement community touted as senior living for the at heart, located in Tempe, Arizona.  In June 2017, we announced that we have signed a manufacturing agreement with SINBON Electronics, a leading solution provider of electronic component integration design and manufacturing with a global presence in the U.S., Taiwan, China, Japan, the U.K., Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic.  In September 2017, we announced that our trutankless® line of electric water heaters has launched a nationwide distribution program with Ferguson, the largest distributor of commercial and residential plumbing supplies, and pipe, valves, and fittings (PVF) in the United States.  In March 2018, we announced our sales and installation expansion into the Florida water heating market, which is over 90% electric, with our trutankless® line of electric water heaters.  In April 2018, we announced record fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. The announcement included a record 61% increase in annual revenue compared to the prior year driven, in part, by a 133% increase in the fourth quarter over the prior period.  In May 2018, we announced that the Company had set a sales record for the first quarter of 2018, which was an all-time revenue record, and a fourth consecutive quarter of increasing gross margins.  In July 2018, we announced a corporate name change to Trutankless, Inc. from Bollente Companies, Inc., and began trading under the new ticker symbol TKLS.  In August 2018, we announced a sales increase of 200% in the first half of the year over the same period in the prior year. Growth was attributed to several factors, including strong demand for its trutankless line of smart water heaters amongst a growing number of the nations largest homebuilders, as well as the impact of improving velocity in channel sales.  In November 2018, we announced a sales increase of 190% for the nine months ending September 30 over the same period of 2017. Increased production and expanded wholesale customer base were credited as the primary factors for continuing sales expansion.    10      In March 2019, we issued a corporate update, including the up-listing of the Company to the OTC Markets OTCQB tier and new patent claims granted for its proprietary home automation capabilities. The Company also revealed several new key relationships with new home construction leaders such as Lennar Homes, DR Horton, and Shea Homes, as well as with national plumbing companies like Service Experts, Benjamin Franklin Plumbing, and RotoRooter.  Target Markets
  The United States market for residential tank water heaters in 2010 was approximately 7.65 million units according to data released by the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). Almost 50% of those shipments were electric water heaters, and the company has found in comparing those statistics with government data, that over 90% of tank water heaters shipped in 2010 were intended for replacement installations.  Trutankless initially market its products to builders, remodelers and distributors in the southern and western U.S. These areas of the country have been selected because of generally higher ground water temperatures, which improves the effects of the performance and capacity of all brands of tankless water heaters. This area of the country also traditionally has the largest share of population growth and new housing starts, accounting for almost two-thirds of all housing starts in 2010, according to government data. Additionally, the southern U.S., and specifically the southeastern U.S., has the highest usage of electric water heaters.  Distribution Plan
  Initially, we will be distributing our first product line throughout the southern and western U.S. using an existing network of plumbing and electrical wholesalers (distributors), manufacturers representatives and dealers. We believe that we will continue building existing partnerships with major companies in the building and plumbing industries to rapidly expand awareness of Trutankless and our products in the water heater market in the U.S and Canada.  Sales will continue to be pursued through the following channels:  1. Regional and national plumbing and electrical wholesalers (also called distributors); 2. Plumbers and electricians on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers have not yet been set up; and, 3. Builders on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers & mechanical contractors have not yet been set up.  We will expand sales of the product further by marketing the product directly to consumers over the internet with a series of aggressive and ongoing marketing initiatives. We intend to market to industry professionals and end-users through more traditional marketing efforts as well, including print advertising, attendance of select national trade shows, and attendance of select regional consumer shows. We also expect Trutankless will be successful in providing education, training, and support to our sales and installer networks as part of our distribution and marketing efforts.  11      We believe our products will be a differentiating factor for industry professionals and builders as they market to their customers. Additionally, our electric tankless products are expected to provide these professionals and their companies with a mechanism to increase revenue and improve gross margin as compared to more traditional water heating products.  Employees
  We currently have six full-time employees, including our two officers, and two part-time employees. We expect to increase the number of employees to expand our sales and technical staff. We are using and will continue to use independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating, general expenses and capital costs.  Available Information
