ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
  Petro River Oil Corp. (the “Company”) is an independent energy company focused on the exploration and development of conventional oil and gas assets with low discovery and development costs, utilizing modern technology. The Company is currently focused on moving forward with drilling wells on several of its properties owned directly and indirectly through its interest in Horizon Energy Partners, LLC (“Horizon Energy”), as well as entering highly prospective plays with Horizon Energy and other industry-leading partners. Diversification over a number of projects, each with low initial capital expenditures and strong risk reward characteristics, reduces risk and provides cross-functional exposure to a number of attractive risk adjusted opportunities.
  
  The Company’s core holdings are in the Mid-Continent Region in Oklahoma, including in Osage County and Kay County, Oklahoma. Following the acquisition of Horizon I Investments, LLC (“Horizon Investments”) in December 2015, the Company has additional exposure to a portfolio of domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders from Horizon Investment’s interest in Horizon Energy. Horizon Energy is an oil and gas exploration and development company owned and managed by former senior oil and gas executives. It has a portfolio of domestic and international assets. Each of the assets in the Horizon Energy portfolio is characterized by low initial capital expenditure requirements and strong risk reward characteristics.
  
  The Company’s prospects in Oklahoma are owned directly by the Company and indirectly through Spyglass Energy Group, LLC (“Spyglass”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandolier Energy, LLC (“Bandolier”). As of January 31, 2018, Bandolier became wholly-owned by the Company. Bandolier has a 75% working interest in an 87,754-acre concession in Osage County, Oklahoma. The remaining 25% working interest is held by the operator, Performance Energy, LLC.
  
  Effective September 24, 2018, the Company acquired a 66.67% membership interest in LBE Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“LBE Partners”), from ICO Liquidating Trust, LLC, in exchange for 300,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock. LBE Partners has varying working interests in multiple oil and gas producing wells located in Texas.

  The execution of the Company’s business plan is dependent on obtaining necessary working capital. While no assurances can be given, in the event management is able to obtain additional working capital, the Company plans to continue drilling additional wells on its existing concessions, and to acquire additional high-quality oil and gas properties, primarily proved producing, and proved undeveloped reserves. The Company also intends to explore low-risk development drilling and work-over opportunities. Management is also exploring farm-in and joint venture opportunities for the Company’s oil and gas assets.
  
  Recent Developments
  
  Horizon Subscription Agreement
  
  On February 25, 2019, the Company executed a Subscription Agreement, pursuant to which the Company purchased 145.454 membership units in Horizon Energy Acquisition, LLC (“Horizon Acquisition”), representing an approximate 14.6% membership interest in Horizon Acquisition, for $400,000 (the “Acquisition of Interest”). Horizon Acquisition is a company focused on oil and gas exploration activities. As a result, the Company acquired an additional 5.63% working interest in an international, offshore exploration project in the North Sea, which is in addition to a 5.63% interest in the same project indirectly held by the Company through its investments in Horizon Energy.
  
 In connection with the Acquisition of Interest, the Company also executed the Limited Liability Company Agreement for Horizon, which provides the Company with the right to appoint one Manager to Horizon Acquisition’s three-member Board of Managers. The Company appointed Mr. Cohen, the Company’s Executive Chairman, to the Board of Managers. Mr. Cohen purchased 36.363 membership units in Horizon Acquisition in a separate transaction, representing an approximate 3.6% membership interest.

 Creation of a New Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
 
 On January 31, 2019, the Company filed the Certificate of Designations of Preferences and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware – Division of Corporations, which it thereafter amended on March 13, 2019 (collectively, the “Series A COD”). The Series A COD designates 500,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred, par value $0.00001 per share (“Series A Preferred”), each share with a stated value of $20.00 per share.’ Shares of Series A Preferred are not entitled to dividends unless the Company elects to pay dividends to holders of its common stock. Shares of Series A Preferred rank senior to the Company’s common stock and Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.
  
 Holders of Series A Preferred have the right to vote, subject to a 9.999% voting limitation (which does not apply to Scot Cohen), on an as-converted basis with the holders of the Company’s common stock on any matter presented to the Company’s stockholders for their action or consideration; provided, however, that so long as shares of Series A Preferred remain outstanding, the Company may not, without first obtaining the affirmative consent of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred outstanding, voting as a separate class, take the following actions: (i) alter or change adversely the power, preferences and rights provided to the holders of the Series A Preferred under the Series A COD, (ii) authorize or create a class of stock that is senior to the Series A Preferred, (iii) amend its Certificate of Incorporation so as to adversely affect any rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred, (iv) increase the number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred, or (v) enter into any agreements with respect to the foregoing.
  
  Each share of Series A Preferred has a liquidation preference equal to the Stated Value plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred is convertible into that number of shares of the Company’s common stock (“Conversion Shares”) equal to the stated value, divided by $0.40 per share , which conversion rate is subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Series A COD; provided, however, that holders of the Series A Preferred may not convert their shares of Series A Preferred in the event that such conversion would result in such holder’s ownership exceeding 4.999% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “Ownership Limitation”), which Ownership Limitation may be increased up to 9.999% at the sole election of the holder (the “Maximum Percentage”); provided, further, that the Ownership Limitation and Maximum Percentage do not apply to Mr. Cohen. Holders of Series A Preferred may elect to convert shares of Series C Preferred into Conversion Shares at any time.
 
 Series A Financing
 
 On January 31, 2019, the Company sold and issued an aggregate of 178,101 units of its securities, for an aggregate purchase price of $3,562,015, to certain accredited investors (the “New Investors”) pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) and to certain debtholders (the “Debt Holders”) pursuant to Debt Conversion Agreements (the “Debt Conversion Agreements”) (the “Offering” and the “Series A Financing”). The sale of the units resulted in net cash proceeds of approximately $2.8 million. The units sold and issued in the Offering consisted of an aggregate of (i) 178,101 shares of the Company’s newly created Series A Preferred shares, convertible into 8,905,037 shares of the Company’s common stock, and (ii) five-year warrants to purchase 8,905,037 shares of Company’s common stock, at an exercise price of $0.50 per share. Pursuant to the Debt Conversion Agreements, the Debt Holders, consisting of Mr. Cohen and Fortis Oil & Gas (“Fortis”), agreed to convert all outstanding debt owed to the Debt Holders, amounting to $300,000 and $321,836, respectively, into units issued pursuant to the SPA. In addition to the conversion of outstanding debt, the Company and the Debt Holders also agreed to convert all accrued interest totaling $18,853 and $62,523, respectively.
  
 The Offering resulted in net cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.8 million, which net proceeds do not include the amount of debt converted into units by the Debt Holders. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds to fund the drilling of ten additional development and exploration wells in its Osage County concession (the “New Drilling Program”), and a large exploration venture in the North Sea, United Kingdom with Horizon Energy Partners, LLC.
  
 In connection with the Offering, on January 31, 2019, Bandolier entered into Assignment of Net Profit Interest agreements (the “Assignment Agreements”) with each of the New Investors and Debt Holders, pursuant to which (i) Bandolier assigned and transferred to the New Investors and Debt Holders a 75% interest in profits, if any, derived from the ten new wells the Company intends to drill pursuant to the New Drilling Program, payments of which shall be made to the New Investors and Debt Holders, pro rata, on a quarterly basis following the full completion of the New Drilling Program, and (ii) in the event the Company elects to drill additional wells on its Osage County concession in the next two years, the New Investors and Debt Holders shall have the right to participate in and fund the drilling and production of the next ten wells on the same terms and conditions set forth in the Assignment Agreements.

 Senior Secured Debt Exchange
 
On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into agreements (the “Secured Debt Conversion Agreements”) with Petro Exploration Funding, LLC and Petro Exploration Funding II, LLC (together, the “Secured Debt Holders”), pursuant to which they agreed to convert approximately $2.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of outstanding senior secured debt (including accrued and unpaid interest) (the “Senior Secured Debt”) owed under the terms of their respective Senior Secured Promissory Notes into 116,503 and 140,799 shares of the Company’s newly created Series A Preferred, respectively (the “Senior Secured Debt Exchange”). As a result of the Senior Secured Debt Exchange, all indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations arising under the respective Senior Secured Promissory Notes were cancelled and deemed satisfied in full.
 
As additional consideration for the conversion of the Senior Secured Debt, the Company agreed to (i) reduce the exercise price of warrants issued to the Secured Debt Holders on June 15, 2017 and November 6, 2017 from $2.38 and $2.00, respectively, to $0.50 per share of common stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants, and (ii) to extend the expiration date of such warrants to five years from the Closing Date. The Company computed the fair value of the warrants directly preceding the modification and compared the fair value to that of the modified warrants with new terms. The fair value of the modified warrants was lower than the fair value of the warrants preceding the modification; therefore, no accounting treatment resulted from the modification.
 
 Acquisition of Membership Interest in LBE Partners, LLC
 
On October 2, 2018, the Company, ICO and LBE, which owns various working interests in several oil and gas wells located in the Hardin oil field in Liberty, Texas, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “LBE Purchase Agreement”), effective September 24, 2018, pursuant to which the Company purchased a 66.67% membership interest in LBE Partners from ICO in exchange for 300,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Both ICO and LBE Partners are managed by Scot Cohen, the Company’s Executive Chairman.
 
 Recent Oil Discoveries
 
In April of 2019, the Company successfully completed the West Blackland 3-35 well, in addition to the West Blackland 4-34, and South Red Eagle 1-34, located on its concession in Osage County, Oklahoma.
 
On July 24, 2018, the Company announced the successful drilling of the Arsaga 25-2 exploration well, located on its concession in Osage County, Oklahoma.
 
On May 22, 2018, the Company announced the discovery of a new oil field, the N. Blackland Field, in its concession in Osage County, Oklahoma, upon successfully testing of the 2-34 exploration well.
 
In May 2017, Bandolier discovered two new oil fields with the successful drilling of the W. Blackland 1-3 and S. Blackland 2-11 exploration wells. On December 15, 2017, the Company received permits from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to drill eight additional wells in the W. Blackland Field, which were successfully completed in April 2018. The Company’s W. Blackland concessions are currently producing, and, with the drilling of additional wells, the Company currently anticipates that its revenue will significantly increase throughout the remainder of the current fiscal year.
 
In addition to the Company’s current development plans, within its current 3-D seismic data, additional structures in Osage County have been identified. Assuming that it is able to obtain sufficient working capital, the Company currently plans to drill ten additional wells in calendar year 2019: seven in the N. Blackland Field, two in the Arsaga structure and one in the Section 13 structure. The Company anticipates financing the drilling of these wells using the cash flows from current production of its existing wells.
 
Our Objective
 
Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by increasing our net asset value, net reserves and cash flow through development, exploitation, exploration, and acquisition of oil and gas properties.
Our Strategy
 
We intend to follow a balanced risk strategy by allocating capital expenditures to a combination of lower risk development and high potential exploration prospects. Key elements of our business strategy include the following:
 

  
-4-




Develop and exploit our existing oil and natural gas properties. Our principal growth strategy has been to explore, develop and exploit our acquired and leased properties to add proven reserves.
 
Pursue selective acquisitions. The Company has acquired leasehold positions that it believes contain substantial resource potential and meet its targeted returns on invested capital. Management intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that meet the Company’s operational and financial targets. We seek to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties that will provide us with additional development and exploratory prospect opportunities. We may also acquire a working interest in one or more prospects from others and participate with the other working interest owners in drilling and, if warranted, completing oil or gas wells on a prospect. We may purchase producing oil or gas properties.
 
Use the latest 3-D seismic technology to maximize returns. Technical advances in imaging and modeling can lower risk and enhance productivity. The Company intends to utilize 3-D seismic and other technological advancements that benefit its exploratory and developmental drilling program.
 
Plan of Operation
 
The Company is currently engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production, with activities principally in Oklahoma in the United States, and Northern Ireland, Denmark and the U.K. in Western Europe. We focus on developing our existing properties, while continuing to pursue acquisitions of oil and gas properties with upside potential.
 
The Company intends to grow its resources and production through exploration activities and development of identified potential drilling locations, and through acquisitions that meet the Company’s strategic and financial objectives. Our plan includes:
 
Leveraging our management experience. The Company’s executive team, along with Horizon Energy, the Company’s operating partner, has extensive and proven experience in the oil and gas industry. We believe that the experience of our executive team will help reduce the time and cost associated with drilling and completing exploration and development of our conventional assets and potentially increasing recovery. Collectively, our management team and engineering professionals identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. Our key management team possesses an average of over thirty years of experience in oil and gas exploration and production in multiple resource plays, including exploration and production in the Company’s core regions of Osage, Oklahoma, Kay County, Oklahoma, Liberty, Texas and the North Sea.
 
Leveraging our established business relationships. Our executive team, along with Horizon Energy, has many relationships with operators and service providers in our core asset regions. We believe that leveraging our relationships will provide us with a competitive advantage in developing our acreage and identifying acquisition targets.
 
De-risking our acreage position and build a vertical drilling program. The Company has identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations that will drive reserves and production growth and provide attractive return opportunities. The Company views its Osage County, Kay County and Horizon Energy projects as de-risked because of the significant production history in the areas and well-established industry activity surrounding the acreage.
 
Partnership with Horizon Energy. Following the acquisition of Horizon Investments, the Company has, through its now wholly-owned subsidiary Horizon Investment, a 14.52% ownership in Horizon Energy, which includes a portfolio of several domestic and international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of industry leaders. On February 25, 2019, the Company purchased approximately 14.6% direct interest in Horizon Energy Acquisition, LLC, an entity controlled by Horizon Energy which is focused on an international, offshore oil and gas exploration project in the North Sea.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Financial flexibility. Our capital structure and high degree of operational control continue to provide us with significant financial flexibility. On January 31, 2019, we entered into a Senior Secured Debt Exchange whereby we converted all our outstanding debt, including interest, into Series A Preferred shares. Following this restructuring, we have no corporate debt, enabling us to make capital decisions with no restrictions imposed by debt covenants, lender oversight and/or mandatory repayment schedules. Additionally, in concert with our partner, Horizon Energy, we control the majority of our anticipated future net drilling locations, including the timing and selection of drilling locations as well as completion schedules. This allows us to modify our capital spending program depending on financial resources, leasehold requirements and market conditions.

Cost-efficient operators. In the past, our management team has shown an ability to drill wells in a cost-efficient way and to successfully integrate acquired assets without incurring significant increases in overhead.
 
History
 
 The Company was originally incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on February 8, 2000 under the name Brockton Capital Corp. We then changed our name to MegaWest Energy Corp. (“MegaWest”) effective February 27, 2010, before changing our name to Gravis Oil Corp. on June 20, 2011. On September 11, 2012, we re-organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to September 11, 2012, and at April 30, 2012, we were organized under the laws of Alberta, Canada.
  
 Petro River Oil LLC (“Petro”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MegaWest, was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 3, 2011. Through proceeds received from the issuance of various promissory notes, on February 1, 2012, Petro purchased various interests in oil and gas leases, wells, records, data and related personal property located along the play in the state of Kansas (“Mississippi Assets”).  Effective December 23, 2015, Petro divested the Mississippi Assets. In connection with the divestiture, the assignee and purchaser of the Mississippi Assets agreed to pay outstanding liabilities, including unpaid taxes, and assume certain responsibilities to plug any abandoned wells. No cash consideration was paid for the interests.
 
Acquisition of Interest in Bandolier Energy LLC.

On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the Company was issued a 50% interest in Bandolier in exchange for a capital contribution of $5.0 million (the “Bandolier Acquisition”). In connection with the Bandolier Acquisition, the Company had the right to appoint a majority of the board of managers of Bandolier. The Company’s Executive Chairman was a manager of, and owned a 20% membership interest in, Pearsonia West Investment Group, LLC (“Pearsonia West”), a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in Bandolier with the Company and Ranger Station, LLC (“Ranger Station”). Concurrent with the Bandolier Acquisition, Pearsonia West was issued a 44% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $4.4 million, and Ranger Station was issued a 6% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $600,000. In connection with Pearsonia West’s investment in Bandolier, the Company and Pearsonia West entered into an agreement, dated May 30, 2014, granting the members of Pearsonia West an option, exercisable at any time prior to May 30, 2017, to exchange their pro rata share of the Bandolier membership interests for shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $16.00 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Option”). The Option was never exercised by the members of Pearsonia West. On November 6, 2017, the Company acquired all of Pearsonia West’s interest in Bandolier for 1,466,667 shares of the Company’s common stock and thereafter owned 100% interest in Bandolier.
 
Until the execution of the Contribution Agreement, described below, the Company had operational control along with a 50% ownership interest in Bandolier. As a result, the Company consolidated Bandolier. The remaining 50% non-controlling interest represented the equity investment from Pearsonia West and Ranger Station. The Company allocated the proportionate share of the net operating income/loss to both the Company and the non-controlling interest.

Subsequent to the initial capitalization of Bandolier, Bandolier acquired, for $8,712,893 less a $407,161 claw back, all of the issued and outstanding equity of Spyglass, the owner of oil and gas leases, leaseholds, lands, and options and concessions thereto located in Osage County, Oklahoma. Spyglass controlled a significant contiguous oil and gas acreage position in Northeastern Oklahoma, consisting of 87,754 acres, with substantial original oil in-place, stacked reservoirs, as well as exploratory and development opportunities that could be accessed through both horizontal and vertical drilling. Significant infrastructure was already in place, including 32 square miles of 3-D seismic, 3 phase power, a dedicated sub-station as well as multiple oil producing horizontal wells.
 
The Company recorded the purchase of Spyglass by Bandolier using the acquisition method of accounting as specified in ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” This method of accounting requires the acquirer to (i) record purchase consideration issued to sellers in a business combination at fair value on the date control is obtained, (ii) determine the fair value of any non-controlling interest, and (iii) allocate the purchase consideration to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their acquisition date fair values. Further, the Company commenced reporting the results of Spyglass on a consolidated basis with those of the Company effective upon the date of the acquisition. 
 
 Acquisition and Dilution of Horizon Investments. 
 
On December 1, 2015, the Company entered into a conditional purchase agreement with Horizon Investments (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company acquired, on May 3, 2016, (i) a 20% membership interest in Horizon Energy; (ii) three promissory notes issued by the Company to Horizon Investments in the aggregate principal amount of $1.6 million (the “Horizon Notes”); (iii) approximately $690,000 held in escrow pending closing under the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing Proceeds”); and (iv) certain bank, investment and other accounts maintained by Horizon Investments, in an amount which, together with the principal amount of the Horizon Note and the Closing Proceeds, totaled not less than $5.0 million (collectively, the “Purchased Assets”). The consideration for the Purchased Assets was 11,564,249 shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.00001 par value (“Common Stock”), which shares were issued to Horizon Investments at closing.
 
On February 2, 2018, Horizon Investments received from Horizon Energy a capital call in the amount of $600,227. Horizon Investments did not have the required funds to fund the capital call. The capital call was not mandatory and the consequence of Horizon Investments’ failure to fund the capital call was a dilution in Horizon Investments’ interest in Horizon Energy by 27.43%, therefore reducing Horizon Investments’ interest in Horizon Energy from 20.01% to 14.52%. Scot Cohen, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, a substantial stockholder, and a member of Horizon Energy, participated with other Horizon Energy members to make the requested capital call in light of Horizon Investment’s inability to make the requested capital call. The determination not to make the requested capital call, and therefore allow Mr. Cohen to increase his membership interest in Horizon Energy, was discussed and approved by the independent members of the Company’s Board of Directors.
 
 Acquisition of Membership Interest in LBE Partners, LLC
 
 On October 2, 2018, the Company, ICO and LBE, which owns various working interests in several oil and gas wells located in the Hardin oil field in Liberty, Texas, entered into the LBE Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased a 66.67% membership interest in LBE.
 
Competition
 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies, many of whom have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us. These competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production, the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
The availability of a ready market for future oil and gas production from possible U.S. assets depends upon numerous factors beyond our control. These factors may include, amongst others, regulation of oil and natural gas production, regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, and the effects of regulation on the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. These regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas and control contamination of the environment.
 
We expect that our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbon liquids from our future U.S.-based production will not be regulated and will be made at market prices. However, the price we would receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market via pipeline.

Environmental Regulations
 
 Our U.S. assets are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations. Public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The worldwide trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating hazards and risks such as well blowouts, craterings, pipe failures, casing collapse, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks. These hazards and risks could result in substantial losses to us from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 
 
In accordance with customary industry practices, we expect to maintain insurance against some, but not all, of such risks and losses. There can be no assurance that any insurance we obtain would be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities. We cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations. 
 
Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition. If we were unable to obtain adequate insurance, we could be forced to participate in all of our activities on a non-operated basis, which would limit our ability to control the risks associated with oil and natural gas operations.
 
Employees
 
At April 30, 2019, we employed four full-time employees and two part-time employees. We also retained several consultants to provide both operational, investor relations and marketing support.
 
Geographical Area of the Company’s Business
 
The principal market that we compete in is the North American and Western Europe. The Company is currently contemplating expansion into additional international energy markets via its investments in Horizon Energy.
