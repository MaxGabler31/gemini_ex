Item 1. Business
Background 
 
Nocopi Technologies, Inc. develops and markets specialty reactive inks for applications in the large educational and toy products market. We also develop and market technologies for document and product authentication, which we believe can reduce losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting and/or diversion. We derive our revenues primarily from licensing our technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees who incorporate our technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating our technologies to the licensees or to their licensed printers. Our website address is www.nocopi.com.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” and other similar terms means Nocopi Technologies, Inc., a Maryland corporation.
 
Effects of COVID-19
 
To serve our customers while also providing for the safety of our employees and service providers, we have adapted various steps to protect our employees. Any employee who is uncomfortable coming into our facilities may choose not to come in. We have a large enough facility to enable all of our employees to social distance and we follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Our production employees work with chemicals and they have always used masks, respirators, etc., even before COVID-19. As a result, we continue to maintain the same level of productivity and effectiveness as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
The impact of COVID-19 on our Company had little effect on the financial results during the first six months of 2021 as the shortage of raw materials used in certain of our Company’s products experienced throughout 2020 as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant price increases were at least temporarily eased, though still higher than pre-pandemic levels, so our Company’s gross margins on those products returned to similar levels as were experienced before the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, during the last six months of 2021, certain of the Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market who utilize printers in China to produce their products have been adversely affected by the cargo surge related to congestion experienced in certain Chinese ports due to a COVID-19 outbreak that began in the second quarter of 2021. The cargo surge continues to the present time, now adversely affecting major United States ports. The world-wide cargo surge along with a container shortage resulted in significantly higher shipping costs during the second half of 2021. These congestion shipping related delays are likely to continue well into 2022. Certain of our Company’s licensees in the entertainment and toy products market have responded by deferring or scaling back production and size of future orders and, in some cases, rescheduling the shipping of completed orders. Ink orders from our Company’s licensed printers in China fell significantly in the second half of 2021 compared to earlier periods. These supply chain disruptions are being experienced by many businesses including our Company’s licensees. A continuance of these supply chain disruptions may negatively impact the number and value of orders placed by our Company’s licensed printers in the entertainment and toy products market with a resultant negative impact on our Company’s results of operations and cash flow in future periods.
 
To date, we have not suffered a drop off in total earned royalties in the entertainment and toy products market as a result of COVID-19 as retail demand continues to be strong for the products marketed by our licensees in the entertainment and toy products market; however, during the second half of 2021, reflecting the significantly higher shipping costs caused by the COVID-19 related cargo surge at major China and United States ports and the world-wide container shortage, ink orders from the printers of our licensees in the entertainment and toy products market were significantly below historical levels. We continue to experience a negative impact on revenues in our smaller anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion products market due to reduced production activity at certain printing facilities that utilize these technologies and anticipate that these conditions may continue for a period of time. We continue to retain licensing revenues at historical levels in the entertainment and toy products market through the current date despite the downturns in the overall economy. While the products of our licensees in the larger entertainment and toy products market are sold by both large and smaller retailers, some of whom remain open, and are also available for purchase online, we believe that revenues may not continue to be achieved at levels experienced to the current date due to the negative economic conditions that are expected to continue over the balance of 2022 and beyond as a result of COVID-19, its variants such as the Omicron variant identified in late 2021 and the newly identified BA.2 variant and other economic factors currently affecting the economy. A slowdown in overall consumer spending may affect the sales of products marketed by our licensees. Our major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are large, well-known businesses in this market with whom we believe our long-term relationship will not be adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Entertainment and Toy Technologies and Products
 Since 2004, we have marketed our Rub-it & Color technology to the entertainment and toy products market. This technology consists of specialty inks that are produced in a variety of colors and can be revealed by rubbing with a fingernail or other firm object such as a plastic pen cap. Rub-it & Color ink technology can be used for coloring books, activity kits, play sheets, single use place mats, greeting cards, board games, promotional products, or any other paper-based application that’s needs some “fun” factor added. Safe and non-toxic, Rub-it and Color conforms to ASTM D4236 and F-963 and other toxicology tests.
 
Every child loves to color, and every parent has a horror story about the cleanup. Our patented, revolutionary, and award-winning Rub-it & Color takes out all the messy stuff related to children’s coloring except the fun. No more crayons ground into the carpet and car upholstery. No more spilled paint on the rug. No more messy markers ruining clothes and furniture. Rub-it & Color ink technology can be used for coloring books, activity kits, play sheets, single use place mats, greeting cards, board games, promotional products, or any other paper-based application that’s needs some “fun” factor added. Safe and non-toxic, Rub-it and Color conforms to ASTM D4236 and F-963 and other toxicology tests.
 
We license our Rub-it & Color technology through various license agreements, including:
 

A. | License agreement with a licensee who has a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market. A license agreement, in effect from January 2012 through December 2017, permitted this licensee to exclusively market: (1) a specific line of products incorporating our technologies through a specific distribution channel but permitting us to license the covered technologies to others for applications and sale through channels of distribution not available to this licensee under the terms of the license, and (2) from January 2013 through December 2017, an additional technology on an exclusive basis in certain geographic areas of the world and on a non-exclusive basis in other geographic areas of the world. In early 2018, we entered into a new five-year license agreement with this licensee which permits the licensee to market products incorporating certain of our technologies, including the technologies permitted in the earlier license, on a non-exclusive basis throughout the world.

B. | License agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties over the initial term of the license, which have been met, with Bendon, Inc. (“Bendon”), an international, well-known children’s coloring and activity book publishing company that permits Bendon to exclusively market products with other characteristics that incorporate our technologies through a distinctly different channel of distribution. This four-year license agreement was completed in June 2015, replacing a previous three-year license agreement. In 2018, amendments to the license agreement were negotiated that (1) extend the license for a period of four years beginning in July 2019 containing guaranteed minimum royalty payments payable over the four-year period and (2) allow Bendon to: (a) market specific new technologies not covered in the license agreement, (b) expand certain rights relative to product content and design that were specifically excluded in the license agreement and (c) market merchandise permitted by the license through all channels of distribution, some of which were previously prohibited in the license agreement.

Certain of our license agreements with licensees contain renewal options and/or guaranteed minimum royalties, while others do not. We cannot assure you that any of our existing licenses will be renewed or will generate significant operating revenues for our Company in the future. In each of the years 2021 and 2020, we derived approximately 90% and 91%, respectively, of our total revenues from our licensees and their licensed printers in the entertainment and toy products market. We continue to pursue additional licensing opportunities for our Rub-it & Color ink technology in the large worldwide entertainment and toy products market through direct marketing efforts and attendance at trade shows. We also seek to renew existing license agreements with licensees.
 
Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Diversion Technologies and Products 
 
Continuing developments in copying and printing technologies makes it easier than ever before to counterfeit a wide variety of documents. Product labels and packaging, retail receipts, event and transportation tickets and the like are all susceptible to counterfeiting, and product counterfeiting has long caused losses to manufacturers of brand name products. With improvements in the copying and printing technologies making it easier to counterfeit labeling and packaging, losses to businesses from such counterfeiting appear to have increased substantially.
 
Our COPIMARK and RUB & REVEAL technologies provide proprietary document authentication systems that are useful to businesses desiring to authenticate a wide variety of printed materials and products. Our COPIMARK system enables businesses to print invisibly on certain areas of a document. When authentication of certain documents is required, the invisible printing can be activated or revealed by use of a special highlighter pen. Other variations of the COPIMARK technology involve multiple color responses from a common pen, visible marks of one color that turn another color with the pen or visible and invisible marks that turn into a multicolored image. Our RUB & REVEAL system permits the invisible printing of an authenticating symbol or code that can be revealed by rubbing a fingernail over the printed area.
 
Both technologies provide users with the ability to authenticate documents and detect counterfeit documents. Applications include the authentication of documents having intrinsic value, such as merchandise receipts, checks, travelers' checks, gift certificates and event tickets, and the authentication of product labeling and packaging. When applied to product labels and packaging, our systems allow detection of counterfeit products, the labels and packaging of which would not contain the authenticating marks invisibly printed on the packaging or labels of the legitimate product.
 
Our marketing efforts for these technologies are focused on specific industries we believe may be affected by product counterfeiting. These technologies also combat product diversion (i.e. sale of legitimate products through unauthorized distribution channels or in unauthorized markets). Another of our related technologies, our invisible inkjet technology, permits manufacturers and distributors to track the movement of products from production to ultimate consumption when coupled with proprietary software. We anticipate that the “track and trace” capability provided by this technology will be attractive to brand owners and marketers and we hope that our ongoing marketing initiatives will result in additional revenues in the future; although we cannot assure you that this will occur. 
 
We currently participate in the retail receipt and document fraud market through licensing arrangements with four printers and distributors in the United States and Canada who provide loss prevention products to retailers and other outlets. We market these technologies through the use of licensed printers and distributors and continue to use our available internal sales and technical resources to expand the number of licensees marketing our technologies in this market.
 
Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A., is a former affiliate of our Company that, since June 2003, has held a perpetual royalty-free license to exploit certain of our anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies in Europe.

Product Revenue
 
The following table illustrates the approximate percentage of our Company’s total revenues accounted for by each type of its products for each of the two last fiscal years:

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+---
Product Type | 2021 | | | 2020
Entertainment and Toy Technologies and Products | | 90 | % | | 91 | %
Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Diversion Technologies and Products | | 10 | % | | 9 | %

Marketing 
 
We have identified two major markets for our technologies and products, the entertainment and toy products market and the anti-counterfeiting/anti-diversion market. Our marketing approach focuses on the sufficient flexibility in our products and technologies and our ability to provide innovative, cost effective technologies for the entertainment and toy products market as well as solutions to a wide variety of counterfeiting, diversion and copier fraud problems. As a technology company, we generate revenues primarily by collecting license fees and royalties from market-specific businesses that incorporate our technologies into their products and, in certain cases, sales of our inks to these licensees and their designated manufacturers. We also license our technologies directly to end-users. Our current marketing efforts are focused on our developed technologies that can be utilized in geographic or market areas not contractually committed to an existing licensee on an exclusive basis. We presently market our technologies through our own employees, sales travel and attendance at trade shows.
Major Customers 
 
During 2021, we made sales or obtained revenues equal to 10% or more of our Company’s 2021 total revenues from two non-affiliated customers who individually accounted for approximately 48% and 27%, respectively, of 2021 revenues of our Company. During 2020, we made sales or obtained revenues equal to 10% or more of our Company’s 2020 total revenues from two non-affiliated customers who individually accounted for approximately 62% and 16%, respectively, of 2020 revenues of our Company.
 
Additional information concerning our major customers is contained in Note 10 to our Financial Statements, attached as Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our Company operates a small manufacturing facility for the manufacture of its security inks that is located at our corporate headquarters at 480 Shoemaker Road, Suite 104, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and we subcontract the manufacture of certain of our applications (mainly certain printing inks and coatings) to third party manufacturers. Our current mix of manufacturing processes are suitable for our Company, for both economic and technical reasons, and we have no plans to alter this mix in the near future. We have established a quality control program that currently entails laboratory analysis of developed technologies; and when warranted, our specially trained technicians travel to third party production facilities to install equipment, train client staff and monitor the manufacturing process.
Patents 
 
Our Company has been granted various patents in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. We currently have patent protection on substantially all of our security inks including the RUB & REVEAL system, and on our Rub-it & Color technology. Our latest patent protects our newly developed technology that may have applications in the entertainment and toy products market.
 
In the United States and some other countries, patent applications are automatically published at a specified time after filing. Since we are obligated pay annuities from time to time on our patents to keep them in force, we annually evaluate our patent portfolio to determine which patents we will continue to maintain. In Europe, annuities for European patents are paid by Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A., since Europe is where they hold a perpetual royalty-free license to exploit certain of our anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies.

Research and Development 
 
We have been involved in the research and development of our technologies since our inception. Although several years ago our adverse financial condition forced us to limit funding for research and development, we are presently actively conducting research and development activities in the following three areas, to the extent feasible: (1) refining our present family of products, (2) developing specific customer applications, and (3) expanding our technology into new areas of implementation. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we expended approximately $181,500 and $173,500, respectively, on research and development. We cannot assure you that we will continue to have funds available to maintain our research and development activities at current or increased levels.
Competition 
 
Our Company has competitors in all segments of our business. The entertainment and toy products markets are highly competitive and includes numerous competitors. The loss prevention market also includes numerous competitors, including large publicly traded and privately-held companies as well as regional paper converters. In the area of document and product authentication and serialization, competitors offer competitive covert and overt surface marking technologies requiring decoding implements or analytical methods to reveal certain information that are marketed for the same anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion purposes for which our Company markets its covert technologies. These include, among others, biological DNA codes, microtaggants, thermochromic, UV and infrared inks as well as encryption, 2D symbology and laser engraving. Nonetheless, we believe our patented and proprietary technologies provide a unique and cost-effective solution to the problem of counterfeiting and gray marketing in the document and product authentication markets it has traditionally sought to exploit.
 
We are a small operating company and many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, marketing and human resources than we do.
 
Employees 
 
We currently have five full-time employees and one part-time employee. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 
Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations 
 
We conduct our business operations solely within the United States; however, we have licensees and customers in Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. These licensees and customers accounted for approximately 58% of our gross revenues in 2021 and approximately 74% of our gross revenues in 2020. Additional information concerning our foreign and domestic operations is contained in Note 10 to our Financial Statements, attached as Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
