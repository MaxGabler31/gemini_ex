Corporate History

TurnKey Capital, Inc. (the Company, we, our, or us) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Vanell, Corp. on September 7, 2012 (Inception). The Company changed its name to Train Travel Holdings, Inc. on March 20, 2014 and to TurnKey Capital, Inc. on January 15, 2016 as a result of changes in its line of business.

As of December 31, 2018 we are a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries are Remote Office Management, Inc. (ROM), which was formed in 2016 and is discussed below, and Turnkey Home Buyers USA, Inc. which was formed in 2014 and is inactive as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company does not have any paid employees however, the officers and directors continue to work to further the Companys business objectives.

ROM Business

ROM was formed to market bundled accounting and computer/information technology (IT) services. Simultaneously, ROM entered into a professional services agreement with R3 Accounting, (an accounting firm owned by Timothy Hart, a director, secretary and CFO of the Company), (R3 Accounting), and PC Lauderdale (an unrelated computer/IT company). The purpose of the agreement was to form a joint venture whereby these entities would cross-market professional services under ROM for one stop computer/IT and accounting services. Through ROM, we generated revenues of $60,000 and $119,500 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from accounting services. These services were provided to MediXall Group, Inc. (MediXall). MediXall is a public reporting company. Each of Mr. Swartz, our President, CEO and director, and Mr. Hart, our CFO and director, is a significant stockholder of MediXall. Mr. Swartz is MediXalls Interim CEO and Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Hart is MediXalls CFO and a member of MediXalls board of directors. In addition, TBG is a significant stockholder of MediXall. Messrs. Swartz and Hart are both officers and major shareholders of TBG. As such, they may be deemed to be beneficial holders of the MediXall shares held by TBG. ROM was inactive during the third and fourth quarter of 2018 and did not generate any revenue.

On June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the SIC Agreement) with Seminole Indian Company (SIC), a company controlled by Chief James E. Billie and Craig Talesman. The purpose and intent of the SIC Agreement is to combine the resources and talents of the Company and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk. To date there have been no revenues pursuant to the SIC and there are no pending contracts or agreements.

Risks and Challenges

Limited Operating History. The Company was established on September 7, 2012 and has been attempting to develop unrelated businesses. We have had no operating history upon which an investor may rely. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties the Company is likely to encounter in view of the fact that it has not yet commenced operations, including, but not limited to, competition and unanticipated costs and expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement its new business or other business plans.
We Need Additional Capital To Fund Our Planned Operations. The Company does not have cash reserves available to meet its basic operational requirements and will be dependent upon the sale of its common stock and, or, other financing to fund potential acquisitions as well as covering our basic overhead expenses. We expect to fund our general operations for the next 6 - 12 months with the private sale of our common stock or from funding provided by our officers or affiliates. There is no assurance we can raise the capital we need or that a financing will be at terms satisfactory to us. We currently have no commitment for financing.
