As used herein, the terms “Company,” “Kimball International,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Kimball International, Inc., the Registrant, and its subsidiaries. Reference to a year relates to a fiscal year, ended June 30 of the year indicated, rather than a calendar year unless the context indicates otherwise. Additionally, references to the first, second, third, and fourth quarters refer to those respective quarters of the fiscal year indicated.
Overview
Kimball International was incorporated in Indiana in 1939. Our corporate headquarters is located at 1600 Royal Street, Jasper, Indiana. We create design-driven, innovative furnishings that help our customers shape spaces into places that bring possibility to life by enabling collaboration, discovery, wellness, and relaxation. We go to market through our family of brands: Kimball, National, Kimball Hospitality, David Edward, and D’style by Kimball Hospitality. Our values and high integrity are demonstrated daily by embracing our purpose and guiding principles while fostering a culture of caring that establishes us as an employer of choice. We build success through nurturing long-term relationships with our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.
We have been in the furniture business since 1950. Our core markets include the commercial, hospitality, healthcare, education, government, and finance markets. Through each of our brands, we offer a wide range of possibilities for creating functional environments that convey just the right image for each unique setting, as furniture solutions are tailored to the specific end user’s needs and demands. The workplace is evolving to optimize human interaction, and Kimball and National provide residentially inspired furniture solutions that create spaces where people can connect. While our rich heritage of wood craftsmanship remains, our new product portfolio incorporates the use of mixed materials, satisfying the marketplace’s need for multi-functional, open accommodations throughout all industries. Our furniture solutions are used in collaborative and open work spaces, conference and meeting/huddle rooms, training rooms, private offices, learning areas, classrooms, lobby/reception areas, and dining/café areas with a vast mix of wood, metal, laminate, paint, fabric, solid surface, and plastic options. In addition, we offer products designed specifically for the healthcare market, such as casegoods and seating for patient exam rooms and lounge areas. In the hospitality industry, Kimball Hospitality works with leading designers, purchasing agents, and hotel owners to create furniture that extends the unique ambiance of a property into guest rooms and public spaces by providing furniture solutions for hotel properties and mixed use commercial and residential developments. Hospitality products include,

but are not limited to, headboards, tables, seating, vanities, casegoods, lighting, and products enhanced with technology features utilizing a broad mix of wood, metal, stone, laminate, finish, glass, and fabric options. 
Spin-Off of Kimball Electronics
On October 31, 2014 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the spin-off of our Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) segment by distributing the related shares of Kimball Electronics, Inc. (“Kimball Electronics”), on a pro rata basis, to our shareholders of record as of October 22, 2014. After the Distribution Date, we no longer beneficially own any Kimball Electronics shares, and Kimball Electronics is an independent publicly traded company. Kimball International, Inc. trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “KBAL” and Kimball Electronics, Inc. trades on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “KE”. 
The disclosures within this Part I describe the continuing operations of Kimball International, Inc. after the spin-off. 
Recent Business Changes
‘Kimball International Connect’ Strategy
In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company’s full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and positions our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. We believe this strategy will successfully position us for the future and result in enhanced shareholder value over the long term. 
Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars:

▪ | Inspire Our People: Leveraging our strong legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are cultivating a high-performance, caring culture. We unveiled our new purpose to our employees on May 9, 2019 and are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work.


▪ | Build Our Capabilities: We are creating center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal, and are centralizing supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. To achieve our goals, we established a Program Management Office to oversee execution.


▪ | Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices.


▪ | Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including healthcare and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers’ first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share.

Transformation Restructuring Plan
In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan that is expected to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe the transformation restructuring plan will establish a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. The transformation restructuring plan includes the following: 

• | Our overall manufacturing facility footprint is being reviewed to reduce excess capacity and gain efficiencies. We plan to exit a leased seating manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and are evaluating our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities.


• | The creation of center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions is expected to result in the standardization of processes and the elimination of duplication. In addition, we are centralizing our supply chain efforts to maximize supplier value and plan to drive more efficient practices and operations within our logistics function.


• | Kimball brand selling resources are being reallocated to higher-growth markets. We also plan to exit four leased furniture showrooms across our brands during fiscal year 2020.

These efforts are expected to generate annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $10.0 million when the transformation restructuring plan is fully implemented. We estimate that pre-tax restructuring charges incurred through the end of fiscal year 2020 will be approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million. 
Acquisition of David Edward Furniture, Inc. (“David Edward”)
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain specified limited liabilities of David Edward, which is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. David Edward is a premier designer and manufacturer of contract furniture, sold in the healthcare, corporate, education, and premium hospitality markets. David Edward products are sold primarily in the North American market. David Edward’s products are generally specified by architects and designers, represented through a network of independent representatives, and sold through authorized furniture dealerships. The David Edward product portfolio consists of classic and contemporary designs, focused primarily in the seating, tables, and ancillary furniture categories. In conjunction with the asset acquisition, we leased the two existing David Edward production facilities in Baltimore, Maryland and Red Lion, Pennsylvania. The cash paid for the acquisition totaled $4.3 million. The purchase price has been adjusted for certain post-closing working capital adjustments. See Note 2 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition. 
Acquisition of D’style, Inc.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we acquired certain assets of D’style, Inc. (“D’style”), headquartered in Chula Vista, California. The acquisition expanded our hospitality offerings beyond guest rooms to public spaces and provided new mixed material manufacturing capabilities. As part of this acquisition, we also acquired all of the capital stock of Diseños de Estilo S.A. de C.V. headquartered in Tijuana, Mexico, another member of the D’style group which manufactures exclusively for D’style, strengthening our North American manufacturing footprint and serving as a distribution channel to the Mexico and Latin America hospitality markets. The cash paid for the acquisition totaled $18.2 million. In fiscal year 2019, we paid $0.4 million in contingent earn-out consideration and expect to pay an additional $0.4 million in contingent earn-out consideration in fiscal year 2020 based upon D’style, Inc.’s fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 operating income compared to a predetermined target for each fiscal year. See Note 2 - Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the acquisition. 
Capacity Utilization Restructuring Plan
In November 2014, we announced a capacity utilization restructuring plan which included the consolidation of our metal fabrication production from an operation located in Post Falls, Idaho, into existing production facilities in Indiana, and the reduction of our Company plane fleet from two jets to one. 
The transfer of work from our Idaho facility involved the start-up of metal fabrication capabilities in an existing Company-owned facility, along with the transfer of certain assembly operations into two additional existing Company-owned facilities, all located in southern Indiana. All production was transferred out of the Idaho facility as of March 2016, after which work continued in the Indiana facilities to train employees, ramp up production and eliminate the inefficiencies associated with the start-up of production in these facilities. The improvement of customer delivery, supply chain dynamics, and reduction of transportation costs began to generate pre-tax annual savings of approximately $5 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we sold our Post Falls, Idaho facility and land. See Note 8 - Property and Equipment of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the sale of the Idaho facility. 
Outsourcing of Shipping Function
During fiscal year 2018, we outsourced the remainder of our outbound shipping that was previously transported by our Company-owned shipping fleet to a dedicated freight provider and sold our fleet of over-the-road tractors and trailers. The outsourcing to a dedicated freight provider partially mitigated increased transportation costs during fiscal year 2018 from non-dedicated freight carriers. The dedicated freight provider operates transportation equipment with our Company branding. We continue to operate Company-owned tractors and trailers to move products between our production facilities and distribution warehouses.
Seasonality
The impact of seasonality on our revenue includes lower sales to educational institutions during our second and third fiscal quarters, lower sales of hospitality furniture during times of high hotel occupancy such as the summer months, and lower sales in our third fiscal quarter due to the buying season of the government.

Locations
As of June 30, 2019, our products were primarily produced at twelve Company-owned or leased manufacturing facilities: six located in Indiana, two in Kentucky, one in Virginia, one in Pennsylvania, one in Maryland, and one in Mexico. We also engage with third-party manufacturers within the U.S. as well as internationally to produce select finished goods and accessories for our brands. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, during fiscal year 2020 we plan to exit our leased manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia and are continuing to evaluate our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities. 
As described above, our facility in Idaho was sold in fiscal year 2017. A facility in Indiana which housed an education center for dealer and employee training, a research and development center, and a product showroom was sold near the end of fiscal year 2017. We leased a portion of the facility back until December 2017 to facilitate the transition of those functions to other existing Indiana locations. 
As of June 30, 2019, thirteen furniture showrooms were maintained in eight cities in the United States. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, we plan to exit four of those furniture showrooms during fiscal year 2020. Office space is leased in Dongguan, Guangdong, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to facilitate sourcing of select finished goods and components from the Asia Pacific Region. As a result of the acquisition of D’style, we lease office and manufacturing space in Chula Vista, California and Tijuana, Mexico. We also lease office and manufacturing space in Red Lion, Pennsylvania and Baltimore, Maryland as a result of the David Edward acquisition. 
Financial information by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019 is included in Note 17 - Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Marketing Channels
Our furniture is marketed to end users by both independent and employee sales representatives, office furniture dealers, wholesalers, brokers, designers, purchasing companies, and catalog houses throughout North America and on an international basis. Customers can access our products globally through a variety of distribution channels. 
We categorize our sales by the following vertical markets: 
Commercial - The largest portion of our business is in the commercial market. We are a full-facility provider offering products for a variety of commercial applications including: office, collaborative and open plan, lobby-lounge, conferencing and meeting/huddle, training, dining/café, learning, lobby and reception, and other public spaces.
Education - Whether K-12, higher education, vocational training or any other learning institution, we understand that furniture for education needs to enhance learning and social environments. We offer flexible, collaborative, and technology-driven furnishings designed to make students and faculty more productive and comfortable.
Healthcare - We are focused on better outcomes for patients, their families, the staff that heals them, and the environments surrounding them by offering products to value-conscious healthcare customers, including hospitals, clinics, physician office buildings, long-term care facilities, and assisted living facilities throughout the country.
Hospitality - We offer a complete package of products for guest rooms and public spaces plus service support to the hospitality industry. We partner with the most recognized hotel brands to meet their specific requirements for properties throughout the world by working with a worldwide manufacturing base to offer the best solution to fulfill the project.
Finance - Banking and financial offices require affordable, functional, and stylish environments. Our versatile and customizable furnishings offer sophisticated styles for reception areas, employee work spaces, executive offices, and boardrooms. 
Government - We supply office furniture, including desks, tables, seating, bookcases and filing and storage units for federal, state, and local government offices, as well as other government-related entities. We hold two Federal Supply Service contracts with the General Services Administration (“GSA”) that are subject to government subcontract reporting requirements. We also partner with multiple general purchasing organizations that assist public agencies such as state and local governments with furniture purchases. The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can terminate or modify their contracts with us at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which would expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders.

Major Competitive Factors
Our products are sold in the contract furniture and hospitality furniture industries. These industries have similar major competitive factors, which include price in relation to quality and appearance, product design, the utility of the product, supplier lead time, reliability of on-time delivery, sustainability, and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We offer payment terms similar to industry standards and in unique circumstances may grant alternate payment terms. 
Certain industries are more price sensitive than others, but all expect on-time, damage-free delivery. In addition to the many options available on our standard furniture products, custom furniture is produced to customer specifications and shipping timelines on a project basis. 
 Competitors
There are numerous furniture manufacturers competing within the marketplace, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. 
Our competition includes furniture manufacturers such as Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Knoll, Inc., HNI Corporation, and a large number of smaller privately-owned furniture manufacturers, both domestic and foreign-based. 
 Working Capital
We do not believe that we, or the contract furniture or hospitality furniture industries in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our furniture business. We do receive advance payments from customers on select furniture projects, primarily in the hospitality industry.  
 Raw Material Availability
Certain components used in the production of furniture are manufactured internally and are generally readily available, as are other raw materials used in the production of wood and non-wood furniture. Certain fabricated seating components, wood frame assemblies as well as finished furniture products, electrical components, stone, fabrics, and fabricated metal components, which are generally readily available, are sourced on a global scale in an effort to provide quality products at the lowest total cost. In fiscal year 2018, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from several countries. The list of products subject to tariffs was expanded in fiscal year 2019 to include furniture products, parts, and components. The U.S. government continues to evaluate the ongoing need for, and the amount of, tariffs, and if further or increased tariffs are assessed, the cost and availability of both domestic and foreign sourced product and components could be further impacted. 
 Order Backlog
The aggregate sales price of products pursuant to open orders, which may be canceled by the customer, was as follows: 

(Amounts in Millions) | June 30, 2019 | | June 30, 2018
Order Backlog | $ | 161.7 | | $ | 149.9

Our fiscal year 2018 order backlog has been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers using a full retrospective transition method.
Of the order backlog increase, $2.5 million was due to orders from our David Edward operation in fiscal year 2019, while the remainder of the increase was driven by higher organic office furniture orders. The open orders as of June 30, 2019 are expected to be filled within the next fiscal year. Open orders may not be indicative of future sales trends. 
 Intellectual Property
In connection with our business operations, we hold both trademarks and patents in various countries and continuously have additional pending trademarks and patents. The intellectual property which we believe to be the most significant to the Company includes: Kimball, National, D’style, David Edward, Fringe, Waveworks, Xsite, Narrate, Pairings, Dock, and Respitality, which are all registered trademarks. Our patents expire at various times depending on the patent’s date of issuance. 
 Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
 7

We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in matters of protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. Reinforcing our commitment to the environment, six of our showrooms and one non-manufacturing location were designed under the guidelines of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Commercial Interiors program. One manufacturing facility was designed using the LEED Operations and Maintenance program guidelines. Our National brand headquarters is Fitwel certified, which is a building certification that supports healthier workplace environments to improve occupant health and productivity.
We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the next two fiscal years ending June 30, 2021 will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures during those years. 
Our manufacturing operations require the use of natural gas and electricity. Federal and state regulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production due to such regulations. In our wood furniture manufacturing plants, a portion of energy requirements are satisfied internally by the use of our own scrap wood produced during the manufacturing of product. 
 Employees

 | June 30, 2019 | June 30, 2018
United States | 2,982 | | 2,921
Foreign Countries | 145 | | 153 
Total Employees | 3,127 | | 3,074

Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 43 employees are represented by worker’s unions that operate to promote the interests of workers. We believe that our employee relations are good.
