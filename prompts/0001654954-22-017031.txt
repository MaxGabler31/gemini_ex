ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Incorporation and Early History 

We were incorporated in the State of Idaho in August 1968 under the name Silver Crystal Mines, Inc., to engage in the business of exploring for precious metal deposits and advancing them toward production. We ceased exploration activities during the 1990’s and became virtually inactive. In December 2003, a group of investors purchased 80-percent of the issued and outstanding common stock from the then-controlling management team. In January 2004, we affected a one-for-four reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock and increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to 100,000,000 with a par value of $0.001. 

In February 2004, our name was changed to Timberline Resources Corporation. Since the reorganization, we have been in an exploration stage evaluating, acquiring, and exploring mineral prospects with potential for economic deposits of precious and base metals. We define a prospect as a mining property, the value of which has not been determined by exploration. In August 2008, we reincorporated into the State of Delaware pursuant to a merger agreement approved by our shareholders.

In July 2007, we closed our purchase of the Butte Highlands Gold Project. In October 2008, we announced that we had agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture at the Butte Highlands Project. In July 2009, we finalized the joint venture agreement with Highland Mining, LLC (“Highland”) to create Butte Highlands JV, LLC (“BHJV”). Under terms of the joint venture agreement, development began in the summer of 2009, with Highland funding all mine development costs through development. Both Timberline’s and Highland’s 50-percent share of costs were to be paid out of net proceeds from future mine production. On January 29, 2016, we executed a Member Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with New Jersey Mining Company pursuant to which we sold all of our 50% interest in BHJV.

In June 2010, we closed our acquisition of Staccato Gold Resources Ltd. (“Staccato Gold”), a Canadian-based resource company that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained Staccato’s flagship gold exploration project (“Lookout Mountain”), and several other projects at various stages of exploration in the Battle Mountain/Eureka gold trend in north-central Nevada, along with Staccato Gold’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, BH Minerals USA, Inc. (“BH Minerals”).

In August 2014, we closed our acquisition of Wolfpack Gold (Nevada) Corp. (“Wolfpack US”), a U.S. company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolfpack Gold Corp., a Canadian-based resource company (“Wolfpack Gold”), that was in the business of acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties with a focus on gold exploration in the dominant gold producing trends in Nevada. As a result of this acquisition, we obtained cash and several projects at various stages of exploration in the gold trends in Nevada.

On March 17, 2015 Timberline signed a definitive option agreement to purchase 100% ownership in the Talapoosa Project in Nevada from Gunpoint Exploration Ltd. (Gunpoint). The Talapoosa Project is located in western Nevada and contains a resource of over 1 million ounces of gold. Under terms of the agreement Timberline paid Gunpoint $300,000 in cash and 2,000,000 shares of common stock on signing the agreement and was required to pay $10,000,000 (“Option Payment”) within 30 months of the agreement date to acquire 100% ownership, subject to significant contingent payments if the price of gold traded above US $1,600 per ounce for extended periods in the five (5) ensuing years. On October 26, 2016, the agreement was amended to extend the option exercise period to March 31, 2019 with the following schedule: payment of $1,000,000 and 1,000,000 common shares of the Company by March 31, 2017, payment of $2,000,000 and 1,000,000 common shares by March 31, 2018, and a final payment of $8,000,000 and 1.5 million common shares by March 31, 2019. Timberline chose to not make the required payment due on March 31, 2018, and, therefore, the Agreement was terminated, resulting in a $3.2 million write off of a loss on abandonment of mineral rights.

In May 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ownership interests in two joint venture agreements in Nevada from Americas Gold Exploration, Inc (“AGEI”). The acquisition included a 73.7% interest in the Paiute property joint venture with Nevada Gold Mines LLC (“Nevada Gold”), and the opportunity to earn up to 65% ownership in the Elder Creek joint venture with McEwen Mining, Inc. The acquisition of the two joint venture ownership interests, at Elder Creek with McEwen Mining and at Paiute with Nevada Gold, from AGEI closed on August 14, 2018 for consideration of ten million shares of our common stock and five million warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. An additional five million warrants with the same terms were issued to AGEI contingent upon certain achievements. Upon closing, we became the operator at both of these joint venture projects. Timberline elected to return control and ownership of the Elder Creek property to McEwen Mining in July of 2020.

During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized an abandonment expense of $48,500 relating to two patented mining claims at in the New York Canyon area of the Eureka property on which the Company had ceased making advance royalty payments.

On June 28, 2019, we entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC” and the “LLC Agreement”) with PM & Gold Mines, Inc. (“PM&G”) for the advanced exploration, and if determined feasible, the development of the Lookout Mountain Gold Project, a significant portion of the Company’s broader Eureka property located on the southern end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend near Eureka, Nevada. PM&G was a private firm incorporated in Nevada with an interest to explore and advance gold projects to production. The LLC Agreement called for PM&G to fund exploration and development activities in two stages for earned equity in the project. Timberline was to contribute certain claims that constituted the Lookout Mountain Project and adjacent historical Oswego Mine area to the LLC in exchange for its ownership position.

Concurrent with completion of the LLC Agreement, PM&G also participated in a private placement and acquired 3,367,441 shares, or 4.99%, of our common shares. The placement included the right of PM&G to maintain its position in Timberline by pro-rata participation in future financings. The initial interests in the LLC were 51% PM&G and 49% Timberline, subject to PM&G’s contribution to the LLC in the form of an earn-in. Timberline would manage the project through at least the initial stage of investment, at which time PM&G would have been vested at 51% ownership. PM&G retained the right to manage all subsequent activities with or without Timberline’s participation.

Under terms of the LLC Agreement, PM&G committed to $3,000,000 of work expenditure during each of the first two years following the agreement effective date of June 28, 2019. PM&G committed $755,605 towards the first-year obligation due on June 28, 2020, but failed to deliver sufficient capital to meet the required first year investment. Under the terms of the agreement, after written notice and a 30-day cure period, PM&G did not cure the matter and thereby resigned from the LLC Agreement giving up all claims and rights to the property. 

Overview of Our Mineral Exploration Business

We are a mineral exploration business and, if and when we establish mineral reserves, a development company. Mineral exploration is essentially a research activity that does not produce a product. Successful exploration often results in increased project value that can be realized through the optioning or selling of the claimed site to larger companies. We acquire properties which we believe have potential to host economic concentrations of minerals, particularly gold and silver. These acquisitions have and may take the form of unpatented mining claims on federal land, or leasing claims on private property owned by others. An unpatented mining claim is an interest that can be acquired in the mineral rights on open lands of the federally-owned public domain. Claims are staked in accordance with the Mining Law of 1872, recorded with the federal government pursuant to laws and regulations established by the Bureau of Land Management (the Federal agency that administers America’s public lands), that grant the holder of the claim a possessory interest in the mineral rights, subject to the paramount title of the United States.

We perform geological work to identify specific drill targets on the properties, and then collect subsurface samples by drilling to confirm the presence of mineralization (the presence of economic minerals in a specific area or geological formation). We may enter into option and joint venture agreements with other companies to fund further exploration and/or development work. It is our plan to focus on assembling a high-quality group of gold and silver exploration prospects using the experience and contacts of the management group. By such prospects, we mean properties that may have been previously identified by third parties, including prior owners such as exploration companies, as mineral prospects with potential for economic mineralization. Often these properties have been sampled, mapped and sometimes drilled, usually with indefinite results. Accordingly, such acquired projects will either have some prior exploration history or will have strong similarity to a recognized geologic ore deposit model. We place geographic emphasis on the western United States, and Nevada in particular. 

The focus of our activity has been to acquire properties that we believe to be undervalued, including those that we believe to hold previously unrecognized mineral potential. Properties have been acquired through the location of unpatented mining claims (which allow the claimholder the right to mine the minerals without holding title to the property), or by negotiating lease/option agreements. Our President and CEO, Patrick Highsmith, our Vice President Exploration, Dr. Steven Osterberg, and our CFO, Ted Sharp, as well as our Directors, have experience in evaluating, staking and filing unpatented mining claims, and in negotiating and preparing transactional agreements in connection with those mining claims, including option and JV or mineral lease agreements. 

The geologic potential and ore deposit models have been defined and specific drill targets identified on the majority of our properties. Our property evaluation process involves using geologic fieldwork to perform an initial evaluation of a property. If the evaluation is positive, we seek to acquire it, either by staking unpatented mining claims on open public domain, or by leasing or optioning the property from the owner of private property or the owner of unpatented claims. Once acquired, we then typically make a more detailed evaluation of the property. This detailed evaluation involves expenditures for exploration work which may include rock and soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysics, trenching, drilling, or other means to determine if economic mineralization is present on the property. 

Portions of our mineral properties at September 30, 2022 are owned by third parties and leased to us, or carry a financial commitment from us, as outlined in the following table:


Property Name | Third Party | Number of Claims | Area | Agreements/Royalties 
-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lookout Mountain (Eureka) | Rocky Canyon Mining Company | 373 | 6,368 acres | 3.5% NSR + 1.5% NSR capped at $1.5 million (excludes Trevor and Dave claims); 20-year lease term commencing June 1, 2008; annual advanced royalty payment of $72,000. 
Silverado | Silver International | 10 | 100 | 1% NSR + $10,000 Annual lease payment 
Seven Troughs | Slash, Inc. | 302 | 4,030 | 2% NSR; 50-year lease term commencing December 31, 1975; no annual lease payments; 
Paiute (ICBM JV with LAC Minerals) | Nevada Gold Mines by assignment from LAC Minerals (USA) LLC | 65 | 1,343 acres | ICBM Joint Venture Earn-in; 60% ownership for $300,000 work commitment with standard dilution thereafter; historical expenditures by ICBM and Timberline combined bring current Timberline ownership to 76.1%.


In the case of properties deemed to be of higher risk due to higher cost exploration or those that host commodities of lesser interest to Timberline (such as base metals), we may choose to present them to larger companies for strategic partnerships. Our strategy is intended to maximize the abilities and skills of the management group, conserve capital, and provide superior leverage for investors.

For our gold and silver prospects where drilling costs are reasonable and the likelihood of success seems favorable, we will undertake our own drilling. The target depths, the tenor of mineralization on the surface, and the general geology of the area are all factors that determine the risk as calculated by us in conducting a drilling operation. Mineral exploration is a research and development activity and is, by definition, a high-risk business that relies on numerous untested assumptions and variables. Accordingly, we make our decisions on a project-by-project basis. We do not have any steadfast formula that we apply in determining the reasonableness of drilling costs in comparison to the likelihood of success, i.e., in determining whether the probability of success seems “favorable.” 

Our Competition 

The mineral exploration industry is intensely competitive in all phases. In our mineral exploration activities, we compete with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do for the acquisition of mineral concessions, claims, leases, and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, including mining engineers, geologists, and other skilled mining professionals. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies. We also compete with other mining companies for exploration and development equipment and services. We must overcome significant barriers to enter into the business of mineral exploration as a result of our limited operating history. 

We cannot assure the reader that we will be able to compete in any of our business areas effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Our Offices and Other Facilities 

We currently maintain our administrative office at 101 East Lakeside Ave., Coeur d’Alene, ID 83814. The telephone number is (866) 513-4859 (toll free) or (208) 664-4859. We also maintain warehouse space in Eureka, NV 89316.
Our Employees 

We are an exploration company and currently have three employees. Management engages independent consultants under contract arrangements as necessary to execute on company strategies at the current early exploration stage of our work and expects to hire staff and additional management as necessary for implementation of our business plan. 
Regulation 

The exploration and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all operations. These permits are required by local, state, and federal government agencies. Federal agencies that may be involved include: the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Individual states also have various environmental regulatory bodies, such as Departments of Ecology. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address such issues as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues. 

Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, a mine operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration, or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or replace the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All of these factors make it more difficult and costlier to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time. For a more detailed discussion of governmental and environmental regulatory requirements applicable to our mineral exploration business see the section titled “Description of Properties - Overview of Regulatory, Economic and Environmental Issues” below.

Reclamation 

We generally are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts of prospecting and drilling activities, which are normally minor but may require contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating roads and drill sites. Similarly, the greater impacts of mining and mineral processing operations must also be mitigated by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies, and may require us to remit cash to pay for reclamation bonds. Should we cease operations without performing the required reclamation, these bonds would cover the cost of reclamation activities to be performed by the regulatory agency. 
The Commodities Market 

The prices of gold and silver have fluctuated during the last several years, with the prices of gold and silver falling to their lowest levels in the past several years in 2015 and early 2016, before rebounding. In 2017, gold traded between approximately $1,151 and $1,346 per ounce. In 2018, gold traded between approximately $1,175 and $1,355 per ounce. In 2019, gold traded between approximately $1,270 and $1,547 per ounce. In 2020, gold traded between approximately $1,474 and $2,067 per ounce. In 2021, gold traded between $1,683 and $1,943 per ounce. The price of gold was $2,039 per ounce in March 2022, but traded considerably lower during the year, reaching as low as $1,634 per ounce in September 2022, before rising back up to approximately $1,816 at the time of this writing. All of these gold prices are based on the London PM Fix Price per troy ounce of gold in U.S. dollars.

In 2017, silver traded between approximately $15.22 and $18.56 per ounce. In 2018, silver traded between approximately $13.97 and $17.52 per ounce. In 2019, silver traded between approximately $14.38 and $19.42 per ounce. In 2020, silver traded between approximately $12.01 and $28.89 per ounce. In 2021, silver traded between $21.52 and $29.58. The price of silver was $26.17 in March 2022 and continued to drop to a low of $17.77 per ounce in September 2022, before settling at approximately $24 at the time of this writing. All of these silver prices are based on the London Fix Price per troy ounce of silver in U.S. dollars. 

Seasonality

Seasonality in Nevada is not a material factor to our operations. Certain surface exploration work may need to be conducted when there is no snow on the ground, but it is not a material issue.
