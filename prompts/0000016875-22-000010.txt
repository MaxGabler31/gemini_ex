Strategy
Starting in 2012, CP transformed its operations by investing in the network and executing a precision scheduled railroading model that lowers costs, optimizes assets, and provides better, more competitive service. 
CP is continuing the journey to become the best railway in North America, with a culture of responsibility and accountability focused on five key foundations:
•Provide Service: Providing efficient and consistent transportation solutions for the Company’s customers. “Doing what we say we are going to do” is what drives CP in providing a reliable product with a lower cost operating model. Centralized planning aligned with local execution is bringing the Company closer to the customer and accelerating decision-making. 
•Control Costs: Controlling and removing unnecessary costs from the organization, eliminating bureaucracy and continuing to identify productivity enhancements are the keys to success. 
•Optimize Assets: Through longer and heavier trains, and improved asset utilization, the Company is moving increased volumes with fewer locomotives and cars while unlocking capacity for future growth potential.  
•Operate Safely: Each year, CP safely moves millions of carloads of freight across North America while ensuring the safety of our people and the communities through which we operate. Safety is never to be compromised. CP strives for continuous implementation of state-of-the-art safety technology, safety management systems, and safety culture with our employees to ensure safe, efficient operations across our network.
•Develop People: CP recognizes that none of the other foundations can be achieved without its people. Every CP employee is a railroader and the Company has established a culture focused on our values of accountability, diversity and pride, in everything we do. Coaching and mentoring all employees into becoming leaders will continue to drive CP forward.
Today, we continue to apply our long-term strategy: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP’s journey to become North America’s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. As a Company, we will remain focused on our next level of service, productivity, and innovation to continue to generate sustainable value for our customers and results for our shareholders. 
Business Developments
KCS transaction
On March 21, 2021, CP announced that it entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Original Merger Agreement") with Kansas City Southern ("KCS"), under which CP agreed to acquire KCS in a stock and cash transaction. KCS is a U.S. Class I railway with approximately 7,100 route miles extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United States south into Mexico and connects with all Class I railways, and primarily moves 
  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  4

Chemical and petroleum, Industrial and consumer products, Agriculture and minerals, Energy, Intermodal and Automotive. KCS is connected to the CP network at Kansas City.
On May 21, 2021, KCS terminated the Original Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with Canadian National Railway ("CN") (the "CN Merger Agreement"). As a result, and under the terms of the Original Merger Agreement, KCS concurrently paid a merger termination fee of $845 million (U.S. $700 million) to the Company. 
On August 10, 2021, CP submitted a proposal to acquire KCS in a stock and cash transaction representing an enterprise value of approximately U.S. $31 billion, based on the CP closing price on August 9, 2021, which included the assumption of U.S. $3.8 billion of outstanding KCS debt. The terms of the proposal were very similar in nearly every respect to those in the Original Merger Agreement, except for an increase in the share exchange ratio from 2.445 to 2.884. Following the United States Surface Transportation Board's ("STB") decision on August 31, 2021 to refuse CN and KCS's joint motion for voting trust approval in respect of the CN Merger Agreement, and after renewed negotiations with CP, KCS's Board of Directors deemed CP's proposal a "Company Superior Proposal", as defined in the CN Merger Agreement, and terminated the CN Merger Agreement.
On September 15, 2021, upon KCS's termination of the CN Merger Agreement, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with KCS. Pursuant to the terms of the CN Merger Agreement, KCS paid a merger termination fee of U.S. $700 million and refunded the CP merger termination fee of U.S. $700 million to CN (together, the "CN merger termination fees"). In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company remitted $1,773 million (U.S. $1,400 million) to KCS on September 15, 2021 in connection with KCS's payment of the CN merger termination fees.
On December 14, 2021, following approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both the Company and KCS, receipt of Mexican regulatory approvals, and satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions and pursuant to the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, the acquisition of KCS was consummated and all outstanding stock of KCS was deposited into a voting trust and held by a single trustee as trust stock. KCS's management and Board of Directors will continue to steward KCS while it is in trust, pursuing its independent business plan and growth strategies. The STB review of CP's proposed control of KCS while KCS is in the voting trust is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 262.6 million Common Shares to existing KCS common stockholders at the exchange ratio of 2.884 Common Shares per share of KCS common stock and paid cash consideration to existing KCS stockholders of U.S. $90 per share of KCS common stock held and U.S. $37.50 per share of KCS preferred stock held for a total of approximately $10.5 billion (U.S. $8.2 billion). Share consideration, cash consideration, and the above described payments to KCS totaled approximately $36 billion (U.S. $28 billion). For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 Business acquisitions.
Upon obtaining control approval from the STB and other remaining approvals of regulatory authorities, the two companies will be combined. Mr. Creel will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. The combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City ("CPKC"). Calgary, Alberta will be the global headquarters of CPKC, and Kansas City, Missouri will be designated as the U.S. headquarters. The Mexico headquarters will remain in Mexico City and Monterrey. CP's current U.S. headquarters in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota will remain an important base of operations. Four KCS Directors may join CP's expanded Board at the appropriate time, bringing their experience and expertise in overseeing KCS's multinational operations. 
The transaction will combine the two railroads to create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada and will deliver dramatically expanded market reach for customers served by CP and KCS, provide new competitive transportation service options, and support North American economic growth.
Specific risk factors related to the KCS acquisition and pending KCS business combination are included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
COVID-19 pandemic
In 2021, CP’s Pandemic Team continued to proactively monitor guidance and orders from governments, public health authorities, and regulatory agencies. Utilizing that guidance while implementing CP protocols and safety measures, the Company safely reintegrated its employees into the workplace where permissible. The Company maintained preventative measures that serve to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, including physical distancing measures, restricting employee business travel, strengthening clean workplace and face covering practices, reinforcing socially responsible sick leave recommendations, limiting visitor and third-party access to Company facilities, and continuously re-evaluating our efforts with safety as a top priority. 
Additional information concerning the impact COVID-19 may have to our future business and results of operations is provided in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Change in Executive Officers
In August 2021, Mr. Michael Redeker retired from his position as Vice-President and Chief Information Officer. Effective July 19, 2021, CP's new Vice-President and Chief Information Officer is Ms. Pam Arpin.

Other current business developments
On January 19, 2022, CP announced that, for the first time, it has been included on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Index, an annual ranking of the most sustainable corporations in the world. CP ranked 34th overall on the 2022 index and was the top performing freight transportation company evaluated globally. The Corporate Knights global ranking evaluated 6,914 companies with more than U.S. $1 billion in revenues worldwide on 23 quantitative key performance indicators, weighted to reflect each industry's impact to the overall economy. Performance indicators covered topics including percentage of "clean" revenue and "clean" investment, resource management, emissions, health and safety, diversity and workforce management.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, CP was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index ("DJSI North America") for 2021. This marked the second consecutive year CP has been listed on the DJSI North America. According to S&P, the DJSI North America comprises North American sustainability leaders as identified through the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. The index represents the top 20% of the largest 600 North American companies in the S&P Global Broad Market Index and measures corporate sustainability leaders' performance based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria. 
On July 26, 2021, CP published its first comprehensive Climate Strategy, outlining the Company's approach to drive innovative climate action and a measured response to emerging climate-related risks impacting the rail sector. The Climate Strategy outlines CP's objectives across strategic pillars, which include establishing a clear understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities; reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and adapting CP operations to the physical risks of climate change. To guide implementation of the Climate Strategy, CP has established two science-based emissions reduction targets that address 100% of CP's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and more than half of Scope 3 emissions:
•CP seeks to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions intensity of its locomotives by in excess of 38% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Locomotive operations represent CP's largest source of emissions.
•To support decarbonization across all operations, CP also seeks to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from non-locomotive operations by in excess of 27% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.
Please see “Climate-Related Risks—The Company has established greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets to guide the implementation of CP's Climate Strategy. CP's inability to achieve GHG emissions reduction targets could negatively impact both our reputation and financial results” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion 
Throughout 2021, CP made substantial progress implementing its Hydrogen Locomotive Program. First announced in late 2020, CP intends to develop North America’s first hydrogen-powered line-haul freight locomotive by retrofitting a diesel-powered locomotive with a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive the locomotive's electric traction motors. This initiative builds on the Company's prior experience with testing low-emitting locomotive technologies and aligns with CP's Climate Strategy in seeking to develop a new generation of locomotives with the potential to produce zero GHG emissions. In the first quarter of 2021, CP announced that the Hydrogen Locomotive Program would employ Ballard's hydrogen fuel cell modules. In the fourth quarter of 2021, CP announced it will expand the scope of its Hydrogen Locomotive Program with a $15 million grant from Emissions Reduction Alberta. The grant enables CP to increase the number of hydrogen locomotive conversions in the project from one to three and add hydrogen production and fueling facilities. CP conducted a successful movement test on the first hydrogen locomotive in December 2021. As locomotives become fully operational, CP will conduct rail service trials and qualification testing to evaluate the technology's readiness for the freight-rail sector. We believe this program will create critical industry knowledge and support the growth of a global centre of excellence in hydrogen and freight rail systems in Alberta, Canada.
On April 21, 2021, the five-for-one Share Split of the issued and outstanding Common Shares was approved at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders.

CP's Grain network is unique among railways in North America as it is strategically positioned in the heart of grain-producing regions of western Canada and the Northern Plains of the U.S. Canadian grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, durum, canola, pulses, and barley, and processed products such as oils, meals, and malt. This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver and east to the Port of Thunder Bay for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., eastern Canada, and Mexico for domestic consumption.
Canadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the Canada Transportation Act (“CTA”). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (“MRE”). Under the CTA, railways can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railway based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton, and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
U.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and durum, and processed products such as feed, meals, oils, and flour. This business is centred in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa. Grain destined for domestic consumption is interchanged with other carriers to the U.S. Midwest, the U.S Northeast via Chicago, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. CP also delivers direct shipments of U.S. grain to western Canada primarily for animal feed. In partnership with other railways, CP moves U.S. grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Export U.S. grain traffic is also shipped to the Port of Vancouver and the ports at Superior, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota.

Domestic intermodal freight consists primarily of manufactured consumer products that are predominantly moved in 53-foot containers within North America. International intermodal freight moves in marine containers to and from ports and North American inland markets.
CP’s domestic intermodal business moves goods from a broad spectrum of industries including wholesale, retail, food, and various other commodities. Key service factors in domestic intermodal include consistent on-time delivery, the ability to provide door-to-door service, and the availability of value-added services. The majority of the Company’s domestic intermodal business originates in Canada, where CP markets its services directly to retailers and manufacturers, providing complete door-to-door service and maintaining direct relationships with its customers. In the U.S., the Company’s service is delivered mainly through intermodal marketing companies.
CP’s international intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver, Montréal, Saint John, and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest. CP works closely with the Port of Montréal, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in Canada and the U.S. Midwest. CP's access to the Port of Saint John provides the fastest rail service from the east coast to the Canadian and U.S. Midwest markets for import and export cargo from Europe, South America, and Asia.
Fuel Cost Adjustment Program
The short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On-Highway Diesel. As such, fuel surcharge revenues are a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 7% of the Company's Freight revenues in 2021. The Company is also subject to carbon taxation systems and levies in some jurisdictions in which it operates, the costs of which are passed on to the shipper. As such, fuel surcharge revenue includes carbon taxes and levy recoveries.
Freight revenues included fuel surcharge revenues of $535 million in 2021, an increase of $238 million, or 80%, from $297 million in the same period of 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased carbon tax recoveries. This increase was partially offset by the timing of recoveries from CP's fuel cost adjustment program.
Non-freight Revenues
Non-freight revenues accounted for approximately 2% of the Company’s Total revenues in 2021. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets; other arrangements, including contracts with passenger service operators and logistical services; and switching fees.
Significant Customers
For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company's revenues and operations were not dependent on any major customers. 
Competition
The Company is in the ground transportation and logistics business. The Company sees competition in this segment from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Depending on the specific market, competing railways, motor carriers, and other competitors may exert pressure on price and service levels. The Company continually evaluates the market needs and the competition. The Company responds as it deems appropriate to provide competitive services to the market. This includes developing new offerings such as transload facilities, new train services, and other logistics services.
Seasonality
Volumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Port of Thunder Bay, and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve compared to the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs, and increased demand for retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions.
  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  16

Government Regulation
The Company’s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations, and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed.
Economic Regulation - Canada
The Company’s rail operations in Canada are subject to economic regulation by the Canadian Transportation Agency (the "Agency”) as delegated by the CTA. The CTA indirectly regulates rates by providing remedies for freight rates, including ancillary charges, remedies for level of service, long-haul interswitching rates, and regulated interswitching rates in Canada. The Agency administers the MRE program for the movement of export grain and makes determinations in relation to the construction and abandonment of railways, commuter and passenger access, and noise and vibration-related disputes. 
In 2018, the Transportation Modernization Act became law. The legislation amended the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act ("RSA"), among other Acts, to (1) replace the previous 160 kilometre extended interswitching limit and the competitive line rate provisions with a new long-haul interswitching regime; (2) modify the existing Level of Service remedy for shippers by instructing the Agency to determine, upon receipt of a complaint, if a railway company is fulfilling its common carrier obligation to the “highest level of service that is reasonable in the circumstances”; (3) allow the existing Service Level Agreement arbitration remedy to include the consideration of reciprocal financial penalties; (4) increase the threshold for summary Final Offer Arbitration from $750,000 to $2 million; (5) bifurcate the Volume-Related Composite Price Index component of the annual MRE determination for transportation of regulated grain, to encourage hopper car investment by CP and Canadian National Railway ("CN"); (6) mandate the installation of locomotive voice and video recorders ("LVVRs"), with statutory permission for random access by railway companies and Transport Canada ("TC") to the LVVR data in order to proactively strengthen railway safety in Canada; and (7) compel railways to provide additional data to the federal government.
Economic Regulation - U.S.
The Company’s U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the STB. The STB provides economic regulatory oversight and administers Title 49 of the United States Code and related Code of Federal Regulations. The STB has jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and proposed railroad mergers and other transactions.
The STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 resulted in numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the Department of Transport and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board’s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes.
Safety Regulation - Canada
The Company’s operations in Canada are subject to safety regulatory oversight by TC pursuant to the RSA. The RSA regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada, including the delegation of inspection, investigation and enforcement powers to TC. TC is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of dangerous goods as set out under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act ("TDGA").
In 2015, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act became law. The legislation sets out minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards ("TIH") or poisonous inhalation hazards moved. It also imposes strict liability; limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level; mandates the creation of a fund paid for by levies on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond a railway's liability; allows railways and insurers to maintain rights to pursue other parties (subrogation); and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement.
The Company is continuing to allocate resources, including working with public and private rail crossing owners, to meet the Grade Crossings Regulations, under the Railway Safety Act ("RSA"), which came into force in 2014. The regulations require existing crossings to meet specified safety standards by November 2021. Based on stakeholder input, including public and private rail crossing owners, TC has proposed changes to the regulations that will revise the scope and compliance deadlines using a risk-based approach. For crossings considered to be high priority, the deadline would be extended by one year (until November 28, 2022), and for all other crossings (i.e. crossings that do not meet the threshold criteria for low-risk or high priority) by three years (until November 28, 2024). The proposed regulatory changes are pending and will need to be published in Part II of the Canada Gazette for them to come into force.
On November 25, 2020, the Minister of Transport approved updated Duty and Rest Period Rules for Railway Operating Employees. The new rules, founded on modern-day fatigue management principles, reduce the length of a duty period and increase the length of the minimum rest period between shifts. The rules establish limits on the total number of duty hours, 60 hours in a seven-day period, 192 hours in a 28-day period and require the implementation of a Fatigue Management Plan and Fitness of Duty Provision. These requirements must be phased in by May 25, 2023. CP is working to address the requirements.
17  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 

On July 11, 2021, the Minister of Transport issued an Order in response to the B.C. wildfires. The Order mandated prescriptive requirements that railway companies must comply with including conducting at least 10 fire detection patrols every 24 hours on regularly used track, an Extreme Weather Fire Risk Mitigation Plan, minimum emergency response requirements and locomotive inspection requirements. The requirements of the Order remain in effect until fire risk reduction measures are incorporated on a permanent basis into the existing regulatory framework governing railway operations in Canada.
On October 29, 2021, the Minister of Transport issued an Order mandating COVID-19 vaccinations. That Order required railway companies to implement their own company-wide vaccine policy by October 30, 2021 requiring all employees to receive their first dose of vaccine by November 15, 2021 and their second dose by January 24, 2022 or implement a set of more prescribed standards for operating employees. CP is complying with this Order and continuing to evaluate the potential impacts to the Company.
Additionally, the Company is working with TC on revisions to multiple rules to improve rail safety, including addressing specific requirements mandated under various Orders issued by the Minister of Transport. This includes changes to the Canadian Rail Operating Rules; Rules Respecting Key Trains and Key Routes; Railway Locomotive Inspection and Safety Rules and Rules Respecting Track Safety.
On February 5, 2022, TC published a Notice of Intent in the Canada Gazette Part I that it would be progressing work to develop a regulatory framework to establish requirements to implement Enhanced Train Control ("ETC") technologies in Canada to help ensure that railway signals are consistently recognized and followed. The Notice of Intent describes an approach that is based on extensive work conducted with railways and labour representatives. The proposed framework would require railway companies to assess the levels of safety risk on their networks and implement systems that are commensurate with the identified levels of risk. Highest risk corridors would need to be equipped with Automatic Train Protection equipment, similar to Positive Train Control ("PTC") in the US; lower risk corridors would need to be equipped with Driver Advisory System equipment that would alert crews to take action; and very low risk corridors could retain conventional train control approaches. The formal regulatory process has not commenced and railway companies will have opportunities to provide input into the proposed regulatory framework as it progresses. At this time, TC has not provided timelines for issuing proposed ETC regulatory requirements or an implementation date.
Safety Regulation - U.S.
The Company’s U.S. operations are subject to safety regulations enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company’s railway operations in the U.S. under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. The PHMSA regulates the safe transportation of all hazardous materials by rail.
Various other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company’s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental, and other matters.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing air pollutants, GHG emissions, management and remediation of historical contaminant sites, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and reputation.
The Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as locomotive air emissions, GHG reporting, management of vegetation, wastewater, chemicals and waste, storage tanks, and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent, and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established strategic emergency response contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested.
The Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically, and regularly assesses the Company’s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company’s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and review by senior management.
CP focuses on key strategies, identifying tactics and actions to support and operationalize our environmental commitments. The Company’s strategies include:
•Implementing measures to minimize or prevent environmental impacts from our operations and facilities, and to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;
  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  18

•Maintaining an Environmental Management System to provide consistent, effective guidance and resources to CP employees in regard to the management of air emissions, dangerous goods and waste materials, emergency preparedness and response, petroleum products management, and water and wastewater systems;
•Reducing environmental and safety risk through business processes to identify and mitigate potential environmental impacts related to all CP operations and activities;
•Ensuring that new or altered operations and other business activities are evaluated, planned, permitted in accordance with applicable regulations, and executed to mitigate environmental risk; 
•Engaging with relevant stakeholders to consider and discuss CP’s environmental management practices and environmental issues and concerns associated with our operations;
•Employing best practices, proven technologies, and safe operating standards for activities involving elevated environmental risk; 
•Planning and preparing for emergency responses to ensure all appropriate steps are taken in the event of a derailment, spill, or other incident involving a release to the environment; and
•Implementing CP’s comprehensive Climate Strategy to reduce GHG emissions and adapt CP’s operations to the physical risks of climate change. To guide implementation of the Climate Strategy, CP has established two science-based emissions reduction targets that address 100% of CP’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and more than half of CP's Scope 3 emissions. 
Security
CP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks, actions by criminal and non-criminal organizations, and activities by individuals. Regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially TIH materials. New regulations published by TC under the TGDA have added requirements for railway companies to take actions to mitigate security risks of transporting dangerous goods by rail. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company’s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or operating results.

CP takes the following security measures:
•CP employs its own police service that works closely with communities and other law enforcement and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services is headquartered in Calgary, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operates on the CP rail network as well as in areas where CP has non-railway operations;
•CP’s Public Safety Communication Centre ("PSCC") operates 24 hours a day. PSCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. PSCC ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies;
•CP’s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modelled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001. Under this plan, CP routinely examines and prioritizes railway assets, physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and threats, as well as tests and revises measures to provide essential railway security. To address cyber security risks, CP implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. The Company has also worked diligently to establish backup sites to ensure a seamless transition in the event that the Company's operating systems are the target of a cyber-attack. By doing so, CP is able to maintain network fluidity; and
•CP security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, periodic security assessments, engagement with our customers, and training of emergency responders.

Focus on Sustainability
Sustainability at CP is rooted in a long-standing legacy of building for the future. We recognize that integrating sustainability into our business processes is imperative to future growth and long-term success as an organization. As one of North America’s top-performing railways, we seek to continue to innovate and advance practices to meet the evolving needs and increasing engagement of all of CP’s stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities and society.
CP's Sustainability Priorities
Sustainability Governance
CP's Board of Directors, through its committees, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and oversight of CP's key risks, strategies and sustainability topics. The Risk and Sustainability Committee of the Board reviews performance against short-term and long-term sustainability objectives and results of stakeholder engagement to ensure alignment with CP’s strategic planning. CP’s cross-functional management Sustainability Steering Committee guides decisions on CP’s day-to-day sustainability tasks, programs and priorities, and reports progress and recommendations to the Risk and Sustainability Committee. The Disclosure Policy Committee gives direction and support to the Sustainability Steering Committee concerning how CP communicates information concerning material sustainability topics. 
CP leadership and employee engagement at all levels of the business is foundational to the success of our sustainability program. Through ongoing engagement across and beyond our organization, CP continues to refine a sustainability program driven by our values and based on a shared sense of business, community and vision for the future. As we take strides to deliver on our commitments and goals, we constantly challenge ourselves to improve our practices.
Climate Change
Climate change represents a significant global challenge and CP is committed to adapting our business and operations. CP published its first Climate Strategy in 2021, outlining our approach to managing potential climate-related impacts, reducing our carbon footprint and seeking to position CP as an industry leader in the transition to a low-carbon future. As part of the Climate Strategy, CP established science-based GHG emissions reductions targets covering 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and more than half of our Scope 3 emissions. 
CP has already taken action and made progress on climate change and to further support the execution of our Climate Strategy, we are strengthening roles and responsibilities for climate governance. CP's President and CEO holds the highest level of responsibility for organizational management, 
  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  20

including oversight of the Sustainability Steering Committee and performance related to climate change, while the Risk and Sustainability Committee of the Board provides oversight and reviews climate-related risks and opportunities. To lead our focus on decarbonization, we have established a Carbon Reduction Task Force, composed of CP’s industry-leading engineers and operations experts. The Carbon Reduction Task Force reports to the Sustainability Steering Committee and will evaluate, recommend and implement climate action measures to reduce our GHG emissions and drive performance in the direction of our science-based targets.
In 2021, CP significantly expanded its Hydrogen Locomotive Program, aiming to build North America’s first line-haul hydrogen-powered locomotive using fuel cells and batteries to power the locomotive’s electric traction motor. CP is increasing the number of hydrogen locomotive conversions from one to three and adding hydrogen production and fueling facilities. This project will demonstrate and evaluate the technical performance in real-world operations and generate critical industry knowledge and experience that will inform commercialization and future development.
In 2021, we aligned our reporting to include the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure ("TCFD") and issued our first TCFD Index to demonstrate CP's full alignment to the recommendations. In addition, we regularly report on climate-related efforts through CDP and supplemental sustainability disclosures. 
Indigenous Relations
We strive to maintain strong relationships with Indigenous communities and uphold policies that outline our commitment to human rights. We incorporate elements of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business’ Progressive Aboriginal Relations program into our practices and aim to strengthen relationships, develop opportunities and provide education and cross-cultural awareness.
CP recognizes the constitutionally protected rights of Indigenous people and is committed to interacting with Indigenous communities in a safe, respectful and responsible manner. Various CP teams collaborate to make certain that we effectively communicate and engage with communities that may be impacted by our practices and projects.
Human Capital Management
CP is focused on attracting, developing, and retaining a resilient, high-performing workforce that delivers on providing service for our customers. CP's culture is guided by three core values: Accountability, Diversity, and Pride. These values drive our actions. Everything we do is grounded in precision scheduled railroading and our five foundations of Provide Service, Control Costs, Optimize Assets, Operate Safely, and Develop People. 
At CP, our approximately 12,000-strong team of railroaders across North America underpins CP’s success and brings value to our customers and shareholders. Accordingly, Develop People is one foundation of how we do business, illustrating our focus and energy towards empowering our people, providing an engaging culture and cultivating an industry leading team. 
Total Employees and Workforce
An employee is defined by the Company as an individual currently engaged in full-time, part-time, or seasonal employment with CP. The total number of employees as of December 31, 2021, was 11,834, a decrease of 56 compared to 11,890 as at December 31, 2020.
Workforce is defined as total employees plus contractors and consultants. The total workforce as at December 31, 2021 was 11,872, a decrease of 32 compared to 11,904 as at December 31, 2020.
Unionized Workforce
Class I railways are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labour unions. The majority of CP's employees belong to labour unions and are subject to these agreements. CP manages collaborative relationships with union members in both Canada and the U.S.
CP employs approximately 12,000 active employees across North America with three-quarters based in Canada and the remainder in the United States. Unionized employees represent nearly 73% of our workforce and are represented by 36 active bargaining units. 
Canada
Within Canada there are eight bargaining units representing approximately 6,600 Canadian unionized active employees. From time to time, we negotiate to renew collective agreements with various unionized groups of employees. In such cases, the collective agreements remain in effect until the bargaining process has been exhausted (pursuant to the Canada Labour Code). One agreement is open for renewal and negotiations are underway as at December 31, 2021. Agreements are in place with the other seven bargaining units in Canada. Four collective agreements are effective until December 31, 2022 with the remaining three effective until December 31, 2023, 2025 and 2026. 
21  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 

U.S.
In the U.S., there are currently 28 active bargaining units on four subsidiary railroads representing nearly 2,100 unionized active employees. 24 agreements are open for amendment and under negotiation as at December 31, 2021. Negotiations have been concluded with respect to three agreements which will expire beyond 2022 while one remaining agreement will be open for amendment in 2022.
Health and Safety
CP is an industry leader in rail safety and we are committed to protecting our employees, our communities, our environment, and our customers’ goods. In spite of 2021 being a very challenging year for our operation, CP remained an industry leader in train accident statistics for the 16th consecutive year. 2021 was also a record breaking year with respect to personal injuries as CP had the lowest injury frequency in its history and is now among the Class I leaders. CP's leadership approach has been the most impactful driver of the strong safety performance metrics and we are committed to continually improving on them. Aside from running trains, many of our employees work in yards, terminals and shops across our network with machinery and heavy equipment, or in extreme weather conditions. Their safety and security are of utmost importance to CP and are integral to the way we view employee safety education and training. Operate Safely is one of our five foundations of successful railroading and it starts with knowing and following the rules. 
CP HomeSafe is an initiative designed to improve our safety culture by tapping into the human side of safety and promoting both safety engagement and feedback. HomeSafe puts everyone on the same level and empowers all employees to begin a safety conversation, no matter the rank or position. We intend to continue strengthening our strong HomeSafe foundation in 2022 through active peer engagement and awareness initiatives. Despite the ongoing pandemic in 2021, CP has continued to maintain a safe operation by diligently promoting our pandemic response initiatives including a set of practical strategies and best practices designed to keep all employees safe and healthy at work. 
Safety performance is disclosed publicly on a quarterly basis using standardized metrics set out by the FRA. Additional information on FRA safety measures is included in Performance Indicators in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Talent Management
CP’s approach for talent management begins with our Human Resources department, which oversees recruitment, development, engagement, and retention with the current and future workforce and leadership of CP. 
The Management Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and informs CP’s compensation plan and programming, and makes recommendations to the Board on succession planning for senior management and processes to identify, develop, and retain executive talent. Additionally, as part of CP’s succession planning program, senior leaders are actively engaged in building the pool of future leaders, and present their development plans to the Board.
CP maintains a number of internal policies and processes related to recruitment, relocation, compensation, employment equity, and diversity and inclusion. The effective implementation of these policies alongside our ongoing workforce initiatives ensures CP’s attraction and recruitment, employee development, succession, engagement, and diversity and inclusion practices are consistent and aligned with CP’s commitments, foundations and values.
Attraction and Recruitment
With a rail network spanning Canada and the U.S., we employ a number of recruitment strategies and retention tactics to attract and retain talent across North America. CP offers many rewarding career opportunities in a variety of roles within the organization in both operating and support functions. We base our recruitment strategy on workforce planning needs, and our focus is on ensuring that we have a diverse candidate pool to fill our open positions.
CP recognizes the valuable skills and experience that veterans have gained from serving their country. Our veteran program was recognized as part of Canada's Best Diversity Employers® of 2021 and we were named part of the top 10 Military Friendly® employers in the U.S. for 2021. 
CP tracks recruitment performance and success rates to better understand which tactics, benefits, and strategic partnerships are most successful in bringing in and retaining new talent.
Talent Development & Succession
As part of our core foundation and commitment to Develop People, we encourage all employees to take an active role in their career planning and development. We believe that investing in our employees leads to improved workplace morale and fosters a supportive working environment. 
Training and Development
One of CP’s five foundations is to Develop People, which is integral to the way we do business at the railway. Our strategy involves delivering specialized training, best practices, and skill-broadening opportunities to all employees. 
  CP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  22

CP offers a variety of training opportunities, providing both technical/on-the-job training, role-specific offerings as well as optional courses. Training includes instructor-led classes and online on-demand, self-directed online learning. 
Non-union employees also complete annual performance management and development action plans with their leaders to set individual goals tied to CP's five key foundations and track progress against Company expectations as well as career development goals. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity is one of our core values at CP. We believe that different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives enhance creativity and innovation and encourage diversity of thought in the workplace. Fostering an inclusive environment where all employees feel empowered to strive for and achieve success supports our high-performance culture and is integral to our growth and success as an organization. Our Diversity and Inclusion team with support from senior leadership is responsible for developing programs and initiatives to achieve our diversity commitments. We are continually working on programs and opportunities to ensure we are attracting, retaining and developing the best people and skill sets for CP. CP is committed to increasing diversity throughout all levels of the organization.
CP recognizes the importance of Board member diversity as a critical component of objective oversight and continuous improvement. As of December 31, 2021, five of the 11 directors (45%) are women. Additionally, one of our male directors is a visible minority, which makes the majority of the Board of Directors (54.5%) members of "designated groups" as defined in the Employment Equity Act of Canada.
CP has regulatory requirements to report on workforce diversity representation in Canada (Employment Equity Act) and the U.S. (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). CP currently collects diversity data on the following categories: women, persons with disabilities, minorities (visible minorities), and Indigenous peoples (Canada) from employees through voluntary self-disclosure. CP continues to focus our efforts on attracting, recruiting, and developing a diverse workforce. This data is shared in various disclosures and government reporting, internally with employees and leaders as well as our Board of Directors. 
Year over Year Diversity Representation

Canada and U.S. Diversity Percentages(1) | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Women | 10 | % | 10 | % | 10 | %
Persons with disabilities | 3 | % | 3 | % | 3 | %
Minorities (visible minorities)(2) | 14 | % | 13 | % | 13 | %
Indigenous peoples (Canada only) | 3 | % | 3 | % | 4 | %

(1) Percentages are based on total workforce (total number of active employees) at year-end.
(2) Minority is a term used in the U.S., Visible Minority is a term used in Canada.
CP continues to work collaboratively with our employees, communities along our network, and partner organizations in Canada and the U.S. to progress and support CP’s commitment toward a more representative and inclusive workplace. Some of our initiatives include:
•Establishing three diversity councils (Indigenous, Gender and Racial). Each council is chaired by a CP executive and represents a diverse group of employees. The councils work to ensure we consider diversity and inclusion when we make decisions, provide feedback on corporate directions and promote initiatives that relate to each council’s area of focus;
•Continuing our existing partnerships with associations and organizations that attract, recruit, and support skilled immigrants, transitioning veterans, persons with disabilities, and women;
•Working with Indigenous groups to develop relationships that are more meaningful, create targeted outreach programs and employment opportunities, and better understand their history, culture, and opportunities for collaboration;
•Supporting the development and advancement of women at CP; and
•Increasing employee awareness regarding CP’s workplace diversity and inclusion practices through communications, education, and training.
Further, in 2020 CP published a Diversity Commitment. This commitment re-enforces the efforts we have made, and will continue to make, in our journey to becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, one that we and those we do business with are proud to be a part. 
We pride ourselves on offering a diverse workplace with a variety of careers in both our corporate and field locations. We recruit and hire talent based on relevant skills and experience, and seek to attract the highest quality candidates regardless of gender, age, cultural heritage, or ethnic origin. One of our primary objectives is attracting, recruiting, retaining, and developing a workforce representative of the communities in which we operate.
