ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
GBS Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, GBS Operations Inc. were each formed on December 5, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware. Glucose Biosensor Systems (Greater China) Pty Ltd (“GBSPL”) was formed on August 4, 2016 under the laws of New South Wales, Australia and was renamed to GBS (APAC) Pty Ltd on October 14, 2020. Glucose Biosensor Systems (Japan) Pty Ltd and Glucose Biosensor Systems (APAC) Pty Ltd were formed under the laws of New South Wales, Australia on February 22, 2017 and February 23, 2017 respectively. These companies (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company,”) were formed to provide a non-invasive, pain free innovation to make it easier for people to manage diabetes using the Company’s Saliva Glucose Biosensor (“SGB” and, together with the software app that interfaces the SGB with the Company’s digital information system, the “SGT”). Our headquarters are in New York, New York.
 
We are a biosensor diagnostic technology company operating across the Asia-Pacific region (the “APAC Region”) and an interest in the North America region with the biosensor platform comprising of biochemistry, immunology, tumor markers, hormones, and nucleic acid diagnostic modalities, and worldwide with our SARS-CoV-2 test.

Our objective is to introduce and launch initially the SGB, the diagnostic test that stems from the Biosensor Platform that we license from Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd (“LSBD” or the “Licensor”), in our regions and the SARS-CoV-2 test globally. This will be followed by developing the platform to its full capacity testing across the diagnostic modalities of immunology, hormones, chemistry, tumor markers and nucleic acid tests.
 

Highlights of Achievements 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Our major highlights of achievements for the fiscal year 2022: 
- | The Company and University of Newcastle have identified and selected an initial site to begin construction of a pilot manufacturing facility on campus. Management along with university leadership and staff will commence the next phase of the commercial buildout that will utilize the already delivered equipment, while the architectural design phase is finalized later this year. The Company anticipates construction to commence before end of calendar year 2022. 
- | On June 16, 2022, the Company executed an exclusivity agreement (the “Exclusivity Agreement”) with Intelligent Fingerprinting Limited (“IFP”), providing the Company with the exclusive right until December 31, 2022, to evaluate and negotiate a transaction to acquire IFP or its assets (or a similar transaction). In consideration for this exclusivity, on June 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Bridge Facility Agreement with IFP (the “Bridge Facility Agreement”) through which the Company provided IFP with an unsecured term loan facility in the amount of $500,000 (the “Loan”), which amount is payable on the earliest of the consummation of an acquisition, 30 days following the termination of exclusivity under the exclusivity agreement, an event of default under the Bridge Facility Agreement, or December 31, 2022. The Loan contains customary representations and warranties by IFP and bears interest at two percent per annum (or four percent per annum in the event the Loan is not repaid in full when due) above the Sterling Barclays Bank Base Rate from time to time. The proposed acquisition If consummated would potentially combine Intelligent Fingerprinting’s leadership position as a revolutionary point of care fingerprint sweat-based drug screening technology with our saliva-based glucose biosensor platform and manufacturing expertise. The Company would be able to serve a wider spectrum of patients at point of care across global diagnostic markets. This proposed acquisition, if consummated, could provide the Company with a clear opportunity to build long-term shareholder value, accelerate revenue growth through an expanded portfolio of tests, and allow the Company to further solidify its leadership as a developer of rapid non-invasive diagnostic solutions. Completion of the proposed transaction contemplated by the Exclusivity Agreement is subject to the negotiation of a definitive agreement providing for the transaction and satisfaction of any conditions negotiated therein. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated, or if a transaction is consummated, as to its terms, structure, or timing.]

The Saliva Glucose Biosensor
 
The APAC Region includes over 164 million people living with diabetes, which accounts for 38% of the world’s diabetic population. Rapid urbanization, unhealthy diets and increasingly sedentary lifestyles have resulted in ever increasing rates of obesity and diabetes across the region.
 
Self-testing blood glucose monitors were introduced to the market in the 1970s and, since then, the method of glucose self-monitoring has not meaningfully changed. The industry remains dominated by invasive methods that ultimately use blood or interstitial fluid to measure glucose. We believe the methodology of the SGB represents a breakthrough in glucose monitoring as it represents the only non-invasive, painless, and cost-effective saliva-based method of measuring glucose levels. The biosensor technology has been developed over several decades of university-based scientific research and has been extensively referenced in scientific literature.
 
The SGB is an organic, thin-film transistor, which in its structure embeds the glucose oxidase enzyme (referred to as “GOX”). When the single-use SGB interacts with saliva it initiates a sequence of enzymatic and electrochemical reactions, producing an electrical signal directly correlated to the amount of glucose present in the saliva. This measurement is then converted into a real-time saliva glucose reading, through the biosensor app installed on a smart device or a dedicated reader. The reading may then be stored in a cloud-based digital information system.

The patent protected SGB is able to detect glucose in saliva at concentrations between 8 and 200 µM and exhibits linear glucose sensing characteristics at these concentrations, sensing glucose at levels 100 times lower than blood.
 
In our development of the SGT, we aim to go beyond the innovation of changing the sampling medium from blood to saliva, and further create value for the patient and the payers by decreasing the cost of managing diabetes, improving the outcomes of the disease and providing convenience in testing methodology. This will be achieved by directly transferring the SGB reading from the smart device or dedicated reader to a cloud-based digital information system to enable all patients the option to create their own medical records where the SGB results will be uploaded.
 
Our digital information system is intended to be interfaced to an artificial intelligence system and will be able to, at the patient’s or authorized care giver’s direction, disseminate patient data to a remote caregiver, a service for consultation or to any other individual with whom the patient chooses to share his or her glucose level measurements. We believe patients and payers will be able to leverage our digital information system to decrease cost and improve outcomes and convenience.
 
With the SGB we aim to drive economic value beyond the revenue stemming from the sale of the SGB units – it also allows for monetization and the creation of separate revenue streams from the patient network and other data that resides within our digital information system, by way of the following:
 

● | Data usage. The usage of the data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data, to improve patients’ conditions and leveraging this insight to improve patient care. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Safe data sharing. The provision of data sharing services between users/patients, authorized care givers and authorized medical practitioners. 
● | Data collection. The collection of anonymized data, its aggregation with other data from multiple sources and multiple health devices and its combination with non-health data. 

 
We plan to leverage this usage, safe sharing and collection of data in the following four revenue-generating channels:
 
Direct Monetization Channel. This channel focuses on the development of revenue based on commercial relationships for the use of anonymized and compliant information derived from data generation. These services may include, but will not be limited to:

--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Bundle payment model with insurance subsidy. 
● | Pay for outcomes model. 

 
Core Operations Synergy Channel. Through combining the data generation with the use of artificial intelligence, we expect to have a deep insight into our customer base, providing an elevated level of customer insight. It is expected that this insight will drive high customer retention levels and generate a considerable number of broader revenue opportunities through direct and specific interaction with our customer base. These opportunities may include, but will not be limited to:
 

● | Direct access to customers for better experience in customer care.

The SGB has been under continuous development for over seven years, first by the University of Newcastle, Australia, then by the Licensor and us. The SGB development program is currently at the design and manufacturing process development stage, which includes the testing needed to verify and validate the final product. This stage involves implementation of the clinical evidence module, which incorporates the commercial production of the investigative biosensor devices to commence the clinical evaluation of analytical performance of the device and generate the clinical evidence necessary to gain regulatory approval.
 
On May 1, 2020, the Licensor filed a submission with the FDA for the Saliva Glucose Biosensor Diagnostic Test, currently in development as a point-of-care test intended to replace blood glucose testing for diabetes management. Following the 513(g) submission to the FDA (Submitted May 1, 2020), it was determined that the Company could seek the De Novo application pathway for the Saliva Glucose Biosensor Diagnostic Test, we were appointed an expert contact person, Acting Branch Chief from the Diabetes Diagnostic Devices Branch. We have further commenced planning discussions with the FDA Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health and the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality pertaining to the clinical development and study plan of the Saliva Glucose Biosensor. We expect to leverage synergies from the planned approval process with the FDA within the Asia Pacific region, We will first seek regulatory approval with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia. However, we intend to apply for regulatory approval in each jurisdiction across the APAC Region.
 
The SGB is manufactured using modified reel-to-reel printing technology that was developed at the Australian National Fabrication Facility. This technology allows mass volume printing at a low cost. Previous research published in the journal Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells has shown that the cost of manufacture of printed organic electronic devices (like the SGB) using mass volume printing is $7.85 per square meter, with an uncertainty of 30%. The size of the printed biosensors is approximately one square centimeter, resulting in a manufacturing cost per biosensor of approximately $0.01.
 
We anticipate that the non-invasive nature of saliva-based glucose testing will make patients more amenable to glucose monitoring, with the expected result of increasing the number of times a patient tests per day. The data generated by the SGB, combined with the interface of the smart device or dedicated reader with our digital information system and the artificial intelligence feedback, will allow the patient to achieve better glucose control through a practical understanding of lifestyle factors that affect glucose levels, thereby helping prevent or delay diabetes complications and ultimately personalizing diabetes management.

The SARS-CoV-2 Biosensor
 
The COVID-19 pandemic will not simply go away, and we believe it will remain with us for many years. Development of an improved antibody assays to detect prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as one of the top unmet needs in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response. Precise knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the individual level can potentially inform clinical decision-making, whereas at the population level, precise knowledge of prior infection, immunity, and attack rates (particularly asymptomatic infection) is needed to prioritize risk management decision-making about social distancing, treatments, and vaccination (once the latter two become available). If saliva can support measurements of both the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as well as antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, this sample type could provide an important opportunity to monitor individual and population-level SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection, and immunity dynamics over place and time.
 
We anticipate there to be 3 different applications for the near future:
 

● | Population Screening – SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is urgently needed to estimate the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 at the general population level. Precise knowledge of population immunity could allow government bodies to make informed decisions about how and when to relax stay-at-home directives and to reopen the economy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Diagnosis – The SARS-CoV-2 Biosensor test can be used as a complement to the (RNA) virus detection tests for patients presenting late after symptoms onset to healthcare facilities and where virus detection tests are negative despite strong indications of infection. In addition, they can potentially be used for informing the decision on discharge of patients who recovered from COVID-19 but remain RNA-positive by RT-PCR for a long time after symptoms have subsided. The degree of protective immunity conferred by or correlated with the antibodies detected in subjects with past SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under investigation. Once this is clarified, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests could be, together with the (RNA) direct virus detection, an essential tool in de-escalation strategies. Currently antibody tests are used for sero-epidemiological surveys and studies. 
● | Post vaccination screening – To assess the degree of the elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses, to COVID-19 vaccines when developed and administered to humans. 

 
We believe our SARS-CoV-2 test will have significant advantages and we anticipate it will be a ground-breaking development in the management of COVID-19.
 
Based on a recent paper publicly available and authored by the team at Johns Hopkins Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Bloomberg School of Public Health, results indicate it is feasible to accurately measure the salivary IgG response to identify individuals with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. A saliva-based approach could serve as a non-invasive approach for accurate and large-scale SARS-CoV-2 “sero”-surveillance.
 
A saliva antibody test can greatly increase the scale of testing—particularly among susceptible populations—compared to blood and could clarify population immunity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The team at John Hopkins further demonstrated in the laboratory that when saliva was collected ≥10 days post symptom onset, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay detects SARS-CoV-2 infection with 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity. In addition, the team demonstrated that the temporal kinetics of SARS CoV-2-specific IgG responses in saliva are consistent with those observed in serum and indicate that most individuals seroconvert approximately 10 days after COVID-19 symptom onset or approximately two weeks post-presumed infection.
 
By utilizing the biosensor platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2 we expect to have lower detection limits, improve on sensitivity and specificity characteristics of current diagnostic methods, be able to provide real time results at the point of care and provide quantitative results as opposed to negative or positive which is how other point of care testing (“POCT”) report the results.
 
Accurate and scalable point-of-care (POC) tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 would increase the scope for diagnosis to be made in the community and outside the laboratory setting They would have the potential to reduce the time to obtaining an actionable result, could support early identification of those with COVID-19 and could also support appropriate use of isolation resources, infection control measures, and recruitment into clinical trials of treatments.

Our Products
 
Biosensor Platform Technology
 
The “Biosensor Platform” on which the SGB is based is a modified Organic Thin Film Transistor (OTFT). The OTFT structure consists of a source and drain electrode, a semiconducting layer, a gate electrode, an optional separation (or dielectric) layer, all printed on a substrate material and superimposed by a polyelectrolyte membrane/enzyme layer onto which the analyte is placed. The layered biosensor architecture and fabrication allows the recognition element within the biosensor to be exchanged. The sensing principle for the SARS-CoV-2 Test is similar to the Saliva Glucose Test: an enzymatic reaction causes changes at the OTFT surface that lead to a measurable change in electrical current that is detected by the transistor. The major difference is that a binding reaction between immunoglobulin to SARS-CoV-2 in the sample amplifies the transistor signal by bringing and enzyme conjugate into close proximity with the transistor surface. The underlying layers of the OTFT remain unchanged. This significantly simplifies our development effort to make a blood- or saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.
The Saliva Glucose Test (SGT)
 
The SGT consists of: 
 

● | The SGB – a single use disposable saliva biosensor, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Software app on a smart device or a dedicated reader that interfaces the SGB with our digital information system. 

The Saliva Glucose Biosensor (SGB)
 
The SGB was invented at the Centre for Organic Electronics (COE) at the University of Newcastle, Australia. Patents for the SGB technology have been granted in the United States (9,766,199) and China (ZL201380022888.2). The core innovative characteristic of the SGB is the sensitivity of the glucose biosensor that enables it to detect glucose in saliva at concentrations between 8-200 µM and exhibits linear glucose sensing characteristics at these concentrations, sensing glucose at levels 100 times lower than in blood. In addition to the patent disclosures, details of the SGB design have been published in Applied Physical Letters, a peer-reviewed physics journal. The Licensor owns patents in Australia, China and the United States protecting the following technological claims of the SGB: the architecture of a biofunctional organic thin film transistor device comprising a gate electrode, a dielectric layer, a partially-organic semiconducting layer, a source electrode, a drain electrode, a substrate and an enzyme; the method for producing the organic thin film transistor device; and the method for determining the concentration of a compound in a sample by interpreting the amperometric signals generated by the device. The Chinese and the United States patent belong to the same patent family, originating from the Australian patent. As such, all of the patents relate to identical technology claims.
 
The basic OTFT structure consists of a source and drain electrode on a semiconducting material which is itself separated from a third gate electrode by a thin insulating layer. The COE has pioneered the fabrication of these novel biosensors based on integrating biomolecules, such as enzymes, directly into the architecture of organic transistors; producing electronic devices with both high sensitivity and high specificity for the target analyte. In these biosensors, a molecular recognition element can simply be integrated directly into the device structure, and in the case of the SGB, the recognition element is GOX.
 
The SGB interacts with the glucose in the saliva and initiates an enzymatic reaction whereby GOX enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide from glucose, which modifies the properties of the OTFT gate material, producing an electrical signal directly correlated to the amount of glucose present in the saliva. This measurement is then converted into a real-time saliva glucose reading, through the software app installed on a smart device or a dedicated smart reader. The data may then be transferred to our digital information system coupled with an artificial intelligence system, which will provide the patient with personalized healthcare advice enabling a practical understanding of lifestyle factors that may affect their glucose levels.
 
High quality OTFTs have been routinely fabricated at the materials node of the Australian National Fabrication Facility. The COE has pioneered the fabrication of novel biosensors based on integrating biomolecules, such as enzymes, directly into the architecture of organic transistors, producing electronic devices with both high sensitivity and high specificity for the target analyte and in this case, glucose.

The development of an intermediate device that communicates to the smart device has been completed. The intermediate device emulates a glucometer, providing the mechanical and electrical interfaces to receive and power the SGB as well as the required circuitry for accurately reading the amperometric signals. We intend to transfer the responsibilities of the intermediate device to the SGB. A possible route to achieve this technical aim is to leverage near-field-communication, or “NFC,” tags, available off the shelf and routinely used in consumer electronics, to power the SGB and implement the communication protocol. NFC tags are compatible with flexible electronics and widely used in “internet of things” applications in view of their low cost. We believe that NFC tags suitable for integration with the SGB can be purchased for approximately $0.10 per tag, even at low volumes. The cost of electronic components is well known to significantly reduce as volume increases. Due to the large, expected volumes of the SGB, we believe it is reasonable to assume that the cost of suitable NFC tags will be viable and less than $0.04.
 
The use of saliva as a meaningful proxy for estimating blood glucose level has been reported in scientific literature, including articles published in independent journals such as the Journal of Obesity, the Journal of International Oral Health, the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry, the Journal of Oral Biology and Craniofacial Research, Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome, the Journal of Biological Regulators and Homeostatic Agents and Diabetologia, among others. However, a few articles have reported finding little or no significant correlation, including articles in the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research and the Journal of Oral Science. Consequently, GBS is performing clinical research to determine if saliva can be utilized as a non-invasive alternative to blood to monitor glycemic status in diabetes patients.
 
At this time, GBS has concluded the in-clinic portion of a clinical study to measure glucose in oral fluids and blood. The study consented 40 subjects with type 2 diabetes, and collected saliva, gingival crevicular fluid, venous blood and fingerstick capillary blood over the course of a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test. GBS is in the process of analyzing the data from this study.
 
History and Background of the Saliva Glucose Biosensor
 
The SGB leverages the decades of history of all-polymer printed OTFTs. Through the research conducted at COE, this OTFT technology has been transformed into a medical device and expected to conform to the highest medical device standards globally. The SGB is based on a modified OTFT architecture incorporating GOX as the recognition element. It has been demonstrated that the SGB exhibits linear glucose sensing at concentrations of 8-200 µM (micro molar) offering a saliva-based test for diabetes diagnosis and monitoring.
 
Fundamentals of the biosensor technology have been well-characterized and have deep scientific foundations. Since their invention in 1947, transistors have dominated the mainstream microelectronics industry. Field Effect Transistors, or “FETs,” are a class of transistor in which the current between a pair of source and drain electrodes separated by a semiconductor is controlled by a voltage applied to a third electrode known as the gate. The gate electrode is separated from the source-drain region by a thin (~100 nm) insulating dielectric region and thus is coupled to the semiconductor. By altering the bias voltage applied to the gate region, the source-drain region can be altered from conducting to insulating and thus the device can be turned on or off. Importantly, the presence of a relatively small number of charges on the gate electrode alters the flow of a great many charges between the source and drain electrodes. Accordingly, the FET acts as a switch as well as an amplifier.
 
The SGB integrates another scientific discovery known as organic electronic polymers. This work, which was conducted in the 1970s, focused on the development of doped polyacetylene. Historically conductive polymers can also be traced back to the early 1960s. Conductive polymers have several advantages over other organic conductors with regard to their processability and hence their use is becoming increasingly widespread. The polymers that show the most promise in this area are based on the polythiophene structure. The flexible nature of these polymers allows them to be processed into almost any desired shape or form, making them attractive for the low-cost production of flexible electronic circuits, such as FETs.
 
The first demonstrated combination of FETs and organic electronic polymers was in the solid-state OTFT developed in 1986 using polythiophene (an organic electronic polymer) as the semi-conducting layer, with a similar device being reported in 1988. The performance of OTFTs in comparison with conventional silicon-based transistors has been considered encouraging and they have already been used in applications in logic circuits or as the driving elements in active matrix displays. Biosensor fabrication based on organic electronics is also well-established, primarily driven by the appealing features offered by these materials such as flexible and adjustable chemical properties, and room temperature operation.

One of the most attractive features of organic electronics is the potential for flexible low-cost fabrication. A common feature of early OTFTs was the use of silicon as the substrate material, and thus since these hybrid devices are not truly all-polymer-based they do not offer all the advantages with respect to fabrication. In the world of sensors, the vast majority of previous scientific research and subsequent technological implementation of organic sensors has involved electrochemically grown films exhibiting performance levels that are, in most cases, inadequate for real applications. Solution-processed polymers, on the other hand, offer the greatest potential for the fabrication of low-cost electronics since they can be easily processed as liquids, unlike the organic crystals and short chain oligomers which are typically vapor deposited. Combining these unique material properties with low-cost techniques, such as ink-jet or reel-to-reel printing, offers the ability to rapidly produce disposable printed electronic circuits.
 
The first all-polymer printed OTFT was reported in 1994. OTFTs are an exciting class of devices within the organic electronics field. The prospect of low cost organic electronic modules incorporating OTFTs fabricated at low temperatures using low energy techniques is very attractive. Low temperature solution-based processes, such as ink-jet printing, allow for compatibility with flexible substrates, upon which it would be impossible to fabricate conventional electronics. In addition, conducting polymers can be synthesized in a laboratory without using rare or expensive materials.
 
Other Tests Based on the Biosensor Platform
 
As discussed above, the architecture of the Biosensor Platform allows the recognition element of the biosensor to be exchanged. Accordingly, the GOX element used to detect glucose in the case of the SGB can be substituted for a different enzyme, or with antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2, cancer biomarkers, immunological tests, hormones and other biomarkers. The substitute recognition element will catalyze a reaction leading to a signal that is proportional to the amount of analyte, or participate in a binding reaction of labelled antibodies that will lead to a signal proportional to the amount of analyte of interest. Given the underlying sensing mechanism is unaltered, we believe the technical risk associated with the development and manufacturing scale-up of other tests for biomarkers other than glucose is considered to be relatively low.
Performance Testing, Current State of Development and Next Steps 
 
Preliminary Analytical Performance Testing 
 
Regulatory Approval SARS-CoV-2 Test
 
For the SARS-CoV-2 Test we intend to use the section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves a novel (new) coronavirus (nCoV) first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in 2019 (2019-nCoV). The virus is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19.
 
On the basis of this determination, the Secretary of HHS has subsequently declared that circumstances exist justifying the Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) of in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19 (February 4, 2020), personal respiratory protective devices (March 2, 2020), and other medical devices, including alternative products used as medical devices (March 24, 2020), for use during the COVID-19 outbreak pursuant to section 564 of the Act and subject to the terms of any authorization issued under that section.
 The criteria for issuance of EUA are the following:
 

● | Serious or life-threatening disease 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evidence of effectiveness the “may be effective” standard for EUAs provides for a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that FDA uses for product approvals. FDA intends to assess the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis, If, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for the specified use, FDA may authorize its emergency use, provided that other statutory criteria for issuing an EUA also are met.

Commercialization
 
It is the Company’s intent to introduce and launch the test globally, through assignment of a sublicense and or distributors agreements. The development path will follow the geographical regulatory path, beginning by the North American markets. The Saliva Glucose Biosensor has been designed and developed to meet the ISO 15197:2013 standard and we intend to seek regulatory approval under the specifications of this standard. The research team at the University of Newcastle, in order to benchmark the performance of the biosensor prototype systems, compared it with the partial requirements of the ISO standard ISO 15197:2013. This standard dictates the analytical standards and performance evaluation of a blood-glucose monitoring system for self-testing in managing diabetes mellitus. The standard dictates that at least 95 % of results for a given system have to be within ± 15 mg/dL at glucose concentrations less than 100 mg/dL and within ± 15 % at glucose concentrations greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL. Artificial saliva was prepared based on the most widely used Fusayama Meyer solution consisting of 11 different glucose concentrations of 0, 0.18, 0.36, 0.9, 1.8, 3.6, 9.01, 18.02, 36.04, 90.1, 180.2 mg/dL. Only the first seven concentrations are clinically relevant in saliva (0 – 9.01 mg/dL)3. However, at this stage of product development we wanted to assess the dynamic range of the biosensor to 20-fold of the upper physiological range (9.01 mg/dL)3. The concentration range of greater than 9.01-180.2 mg/dL is not clinically relevant criteria for glucose in saliva. The results of the 116 prototype biosensors that were assessed for precision and accuracy by implementing the ISO standard. In conclusion, from the 116 devices assessed 110 devices (94.8 %) met the blood glucose ISO standard in relation to the adapted system accuracy (i.e. 95 % of the measured results must fall within ± 15 mg/dL at glucose concentrations less than 100 mg/dL).
 
We believe the deficiency of the 6 prototype devices that failed to meet the ISO standard is attributable to the previously non-validated manual printing process of the biosensors, rather than a biosensor technology deficiency. Currently the biosensor is in the process of transferring to a quality-controlled pilot production phase , standardizing the automated processes, and characterization procedures which will eliminate such manufacturing deviations in the released biosensor product format. Regardless, 110 prototype sensors in this test performed at a level to allow compliance with the ISO standard. It is important to note that the ISO standard references blood glucose monitors rather than salivary glucose monitors so a direct application of the standard here is not entirely practical.
 
Manufacturing
 
The facilities required for the fabrication of these OTFT devices are all in place at the Australian National Fabrication Facility, which we have used for fabrication and testing. These facilities are being extensively used, and we anticipate they can also be used for initial manufacturing and charged under a cost recovery basis.
 
We received approval for $4.7 million (excluding GST/VAT) Medical Products Priority Grant funding by the Australian Government in June 2021 as contributions towards the establishment of a high-tech manufacturing facility in Australia. Amounts will be paid under this grant upon GBS in achieving certain deliverables.
 
Inherent in the manufacturing process is a separate calibration process that is batch dependent and ensures analytical performance quality control. Further to this an authenticity validation process verifies that the biosensor is authentic or otherwise flags a device.
 
The Company and University of Newcastle have identified and selected an initial site to begin operations on campus. Management along with university leadership and staff will commence this next phase of the commercial buildout that will utilize the already delivered equipment, while the architectural design phase is finalized later this year and the primary manufacturing and construction begins on this second site location. The Company anticipates construction to commence before end of calendar year 2022.

Distribution
 
We intend, assuming the completion of development and regulatory approval, to market and distribute the SGT in the APAC Region. We propose to enter into arrangements with distributors to market and sell the SGB. We have entered into an agreement in principle with a medical affairs commercialization company to drive prelaunch activity with the scope to create awareness and build “share of voice” with local referring physicians, diabetes educators, patient associations, government organizations and general practitioners. We also recently entered into non-binding memoranda of understanding with two large distributors in China, which express our intent to enter into definitive agreements to collaborate on the manufacture, regulatory approval, and distribution and sale of, and the medical affairs, marketing, and identification of strategic opportunities for, the SGB in China. We engaged L.E.K Consulting to assist in expanding the scope of commercial partners.
 
Our strategy will depend in part on finding qualified distributors for the marketing and sale of our products. We will work with these distributors to market our products. These distributors typically would sell a variety of other, non-competing products and will be expected to devote certain resources to selling the SGB. We expect to devote suitable time and effort to recruiting and retaining qualified third-party distributors and training them in our technology and product offering. We plan to adopt a multiple channel strategy to balance the marketing and sales efforts.
 
The Glucose Monitoring Industry
 
The Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose
 
Self-Monitoring of blood glucose is the main approach for glucose monitoring and has been used for over 40 years. Currently, self-monitoring of blood glucose is conducted periodically by the patient using a blood glucose measuring device. Blood glucometers require pricking a finger with a lancet and applying a drop of blood on the test strip. The test strip is then inserted into the device which provides a reading of glucose level in blood. Test strips are supplied by the glucometer manufacturer and are generally device-specific, although generic test strips are also available. There are more than 100 types of blood glucometers currently are commercially available and they differentiate based on size and weight, cost, data storage capacity, test accuracy, blood sample size and screen visibility (users with poor eyesight may prefer larger screens).
Continuous Glucose Monitoring
 
Continuous glucose monitoring is not an alternative to finger prick self-monitoring of blood glucose. Only one system to date has been deemed of equivalent use “as an aid to monitor the effectiveness of diabetes control” or non-adjunctive use. The procedure is invasive and involves the insertion of a glucose biosensor into the subcutaneous tissue layer or the hypodermis. The biosensor, which measures glucose levels in interstitial fluid, is attached to a transmitter that sends signals to either an insulin pump or a portable meter. These devices are generally worn for about one week and require regular calibration through conventional blood glucose detection, about twice a day. While the accuracy of these devices has been an issue, it has improved in recent years. Continuous glucose monitoring can track a patients’ glucose throughout the day and night, notifying the patient of highs and lows so the person can act. Subcutaneous glucose levels change more slowly than plasma glucose, which can be a restriction to their effectiveness, particularly if glucose levels are changing rapidly. Subcutaneous glucose levels have a time lag compared to blood glucose measurements, and measurements may not always match blood glucose. Continuous glucose monitoring is commonly used in conjunction with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or “CSII,” which involves a patient wearing an insulin pump and infusion set that infuses insulin into the body. Although pumps are currently manually controlled by the patient, continuous glucose monitoring combined with CSII could potentially be used as part of a closed-loop. CSII is generally restricted to Type 1 diabetics, where the need for ongoing insulin infusion is highest. Continuous glucose monitoring is mainly used in a limited proportion of diabetics, particularly those concerned about severe, nocturnal hypoglycemia, pregnant women who require meticulous glucose control or those who may not be able to easily administer a self-monitoring test (e.g., those living in remote or hostile environments). However, continuous glucose monitoring is more expensive than traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose and in many cases is not eligible for reimbursement.
Importance of Glucose Monitoring
 
One of the main aims of diabetes monitoring and management is to maintain blood glucose levels within a specified target range. Self-monitoring of blood glucose should be part of a regular management plan for patients with diabetes to enable this. Self-monitoring provides information regarding an individual’s dynamic blood glucose profile. This information can help with the appropriate scheduling of food, activity, and medication. It is also required for understanding of the timing of blood glucose variations. Lack of regular self-monitoring predicts hospitalization for diabetes-related complications. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an essential tool for people with diabetes who are taking insulin or for those who experience fluctuations in their blood glucose levels, especially hypoglycemia. For patients taking insulin and adjusting their dose, self-monitoring is needed for self-management. For others receiving oral medication, profiling glucose trends and the confirmation of high or low blood glucose can be a useful addendum to successful management.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose aids the management of diabetes by:
 

● | facilitating the development of an individualized blood glucose profile, which can then guide health care professionals in treatment planning for an individualized diabetic regimen; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | giving people with diabetes and their families the ability to make appropriate day-to-day treatment choices in diet and physical activity as well as administration of insulin or other agents; 
● | improving patients’ recognition of hypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia; and 
● | enhancing patient education and patient empowerment regarding the effects of lifestyle and pharmaceutical intervention on glycemic control. 

 
The role of blood glucose control in preventing the development and progression of complications has been proven in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with an especially strong relationship between intensive blood glucose control and complications such as neuropathy (affecting limbs) and diabetic retinopathy (leading to blindness).
 
Over time, glucose measurements are expected to provide the patient and their health care professionals with the information and insights required to determine the best management strategy for diabetes, potentially minimizing the fluctuations in their glucose levels and resulting in better health outcomes.
 
The role of blood glucose monitoring and control in preventing the development and progression of diabetes complications has been well established. Studies show that those who properly monitored blood glucose levels had better health outcomes (such as reduced complications of diabetes) compared to those who did not.
 
For a person with diabetes, however, this daily process is not only painful but can be exhausting, disruptive, frustrating, frightening and consuming, which often leads to poor compliance and poor health outcomes. People with diabetes have reported that stigma is a significant concern to them. This causes tension and anxiety and, because the procedure is perceived as inconvenient and difficult, leads to suboptimal monitoring and poor adherence. Many people with diabetes do not test as often as clinically recommended, increasing the risk of complications.
 
Technology License Agreement
 
On June 23, 2020, we entered into a certain Technology License Agreement, or the “License Agreement,” with Life Science Biosensor Diagnostics Pty Ltd, (“LSBD” or “Licensor”).
 
The License Agreement sets forth our contractual rights and responsibilities relating to the Licensed Products. The “Licensed Products” include: (i) a biosensor strip for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; (ii) a proprietary smartphone application for the purpose reading, storing, analyzing and providing patient support programs for any one or more of the Indicators for the purpose of measuring the amount or concentration of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); and/or (iii) a dedicated sensor strip reading device for any one or more of the Indicators for the purpose of measuring the amount or concentration of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
 
An “Authorized Supplier” includes us, the Licensor, any of our affiliates or any affiliates of the Licensor, or any third party manufacturer and/or reseller that the Licensor has expressly identified or approved in advance in writing for the purpose of quality control for the supply of Licensed Products to us.

Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to us an exclusive license to the Licensor’s proprietary rights to the biosensor technology used in the Licensed Products, worldwide and solely to:
 

● | act as the authorized party for the purpose of prosecuting the application of, and obtaining any, regulatory approval for the Licensed Product, including being authorized to prosecute the approval for an investigational device required for the purpose of carrying out clinical studies; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | manufacture, promote, market, import, offer, sell and distribute the Licensed Products; 
● | provide reasonable customer support services on the use of the Licensed Products to end users of, and health care practitioners referring end users to, the Licensed Products; 
● | use the Licensed Products only for the purposes identified and permitted pursuant to regulatory approval; and 
● | collect data acquired from the Licensed Products. 

 
We are required to collect and anonymize demographic information about the end users of the Licensed Products and data acquired from the Licensed Products. While the anonymized data will be owned by the Licensor, we will own during the term of the License Agreement the personally identifiable data, including health data, collected by us. In addition, the Licensor will provide us with certain of the data acquired from the Licensed Products. The demographic information and personally identifiable information will be used, following patient consent, as a disease management tool to offer patients value-added services, i.e., personalized education services for lifestyle, diet and glucose management. These services will be in accordance with the applicable local medical codes and regulatory environment. The use of such consensual information will be in accordance with privacy laws of the relevant countries and territories.
 
The license is non-transferable, non-assignable and non-sublicensable, except that the Licensor will in good faith consider any request by us for any sublicense.
 
Commencing after the receipt of regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, and the earning of revenue we will be required to pay the Licensor a minimum royalty fee with respect to such jurisdiction for each year, or the “Minimum Royalty,” in four equal quarterly installments. The Minimum Royalty will be 13% of the projected net sales in such jurisdiction for each such year. The projected net sales will be an amount mutually agreed between us and the Licensor for the first such year. For each ensuing year after the first year, the projected net sales will be the number of Licensed Products sold in such jurisdiction in the prior year, as adjusted for the mutually agreed expected market growth. In addition to the expected market growth, there will be an additional growth rate percentage of 7% for each year through the tenth year. In the event of a dispute between us and the Licensor regarding the determination of the expected market growth or the additional growth percentage, the License Agreement provides for resolution by an independent third party. At the end of each quarter, if the quarterly installment of the Minimum Royalty is less than 13% of the actual net sales of Licensed Products in such jurisdiction for such quarter, or the “Actual Royalty,” we will pay Licensor the difference between the quarterly installment of the Minimum Royalty and the Actual Royalty. The royalty fee rate will be reduced from 13% to 3% upon the expiration of the patent portfolio covered by the License Agreement.
 
As between us and the Licensor, the Licensor solely owns all right, title and interest to, among other items of intellectual property, the biosensor technology (including any improvements made to the biosensor technology by us), the anonymized data collected by us and any other technology of the Licensor, and all derivations based on, and all proprietary rights in, the foregoing. The Licensor will have the right to decide whether to protect or enforce, and the right to control any action relating to the protection and enforcement of, any of the foregoing intellectual property and proprietary rights.
 
There is no set expiration date for the License Agreement. However, the exclusivity of the license granted under the License Agreement runs until the expiration of the patent portfolio covered by the License Agreement, which is currently until 2033. We expect that the patent portfolio will be extended as new patents are created throughout product development, thereby extending the exclusivity of the License Agreement. For instance, we expect to seek additional patents in connection with the development of the Prostate Specific Antigen test, the Peanut Kernel Allergen test and the Luteinizing Hormone test. The License Agreement may be terminated by us in the event of a material breach by the Licensor, if the Licensor does not cure the breach within 30 days after receiving notice of the breach; or in the event the Licensor discontinues its business operations or in the case of certain events related to insolvency or bankruptcy. The License Agreement also may be terminated by us at any time after the tenth anniversary of the License Agreement upon 180 days’ prior written notice.

On March 31, 2021, the Company, entered into an Option Agreement with LSBD and BiosensX (North America) Inc. (“BIOX”). Under the terms of this Option Agreement, LSBD granted to the Company an exclusive option (the “Option”) to purchase an exclusive license to use, make, sell and offer to sell products under the intellectual property rights in connection with the Biosensor technology the glucose/diabetes management field in the United States, Mexico and Canada (the “NA Territory”). The Company is entitled to exercise this Option at any time during the 2-year term from the effective date of the Option Agreement by paying the option fee in the amount of $5 million to LSBD at the time of the option exercise. Upon such exercise, (i) LSBD and BIOX will promptly terminate their respective agreement with respect to the NA Territory, and (ii) LSBD and the Company will promptly enter into a license agreement pursuant to which LSBD will grant an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense) to the Company, substantially on the same set of terms as the LSBD-BIOX license agreement currently in place, provided that the license agreement between LSBD and the Company will also contain a commercialization milestone payment to the LSBD for the equivalent of 5 years’ of royalties based upon agreed maintainable sales due 90 days from the end of the first royalty year. The terms and provisions of the foregoing transaction have been reviewed and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our business depends on the proprietary biosensor technologies licensed by us from the Licensor. The Licensor has secured and continues to pursue intellectual property rights related to this technology in China, the United States and other countries. The original patent application, which claims a priority date of March 2012, has been granted in the United States (9,766,199) and China (ZL201380022888.2). A second international patent application (PCT/AU2016/050555) claiming iterations to the device design has been filed with a priority date of June 2016 and will soon enter national phase in certain jurisdictions, and further patent applications are in preparation. The patents protect the following technological claims of the SGB: the architecture of a biofunctional organic thin film transistor device comprising a gate electrode, a dielectric layer, a partially-organic semiconducting layer, a source electrode, a drain electrode, a substrate and an enzyme; the method for producing the organic thin film transistor device; and the method for determining the concentration of a compound in a sample by interpreting the amperometric signals generated by the device. The Chinese and the United States patent belong to the same patent family, originating from the Australian patent. As such, all of the patents relate to identical technology claims.
 
We believe that the Licensor intends to aggressively prosecute these patent applications and file further applications, as appropriate, to protect the proprietary biosensor technologies, including improvements thereon, in the United States as well as in the APAC Region, and to take any necessary action to maintain and enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance, however, that the Licensor will take such actions, and under the License Agreement, we have no right to compel them to do so. If the Licensor elects not to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights, we would be permitted take action to protect or enforce these rights in the APAC Region, but any such action would be at our cost and expense.
 
We intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property rights in any technologies owned by us through patents and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. We also will rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to protect any of our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All of our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement. In addition, we may license additional technologies from the Licensor or third parties. Prior to any further acquisition or licensing of technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to obtain and protect these rights, and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.
 
The issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.
