Item 1. Business.
Our Company
 
 Astika Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”, “us” or “registrant”) is refocusing and preparing to relaunch the Company through one or more strategic acquisitions in the textile, service, agricultural and industrial sectors in Asia and New Zealand.  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on January 13, 2011.  On September 26, 2014, the Company dissolved its subsidiary Astika Music Entertainment, Inc.  The dissolution was in response to the change in the nature of business operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $0 revenues and had a net loss of $269,600.


We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, which became law in April, 2012. Under the JOBS Act, “emerging growth companies”, can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at Level 1, 725 Rosebank Road, Avondale, Auckland, 1348, New Zealand. Our telephone number is (64) 9 929 0502. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on January 13, 2011. Our fiscal year end is December 31.
 
Current Operations
 
We ceased providing services to customers and other activities that generate revenue. Significant costs after this period consisted primarily of audit and legal costs. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we did not conduct business operations except to evaluate potential lines of business. 
Going Concern
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2017 had a shareholders deficit of $69,200. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity. The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy.
 
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities in the future. As of now there are no required governmental approvals present that we need approval from or any existing government regulation on our business.
