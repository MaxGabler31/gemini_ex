 Item 1. Business
     Overview
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. We have three internally-developed late-stage clinical drug candidates:
· | Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) — an investigational small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, or BTK, that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China as a potential monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas, and for which we expect to file for approval in China in 2018 for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL;

· | Pamiparib (BGB-290) — an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes that is being evaluated in a pivotal clinical trial in China, with a global pivotal trial expected in 2018, as a potential monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various solid tumors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, we have two internally-developed drug candidates in Phase 1 clinical development: lifirafenib (BGB-283), an investigational RAF dimer inhibitor, and BGB-A333, an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1. 
 In 2017, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, in which we granted Celgene exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tislelizumab for solid tumors in the United States, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world outside of Asia. We retained rights to tislelizumab for solid tumors in Asia (ex-Japan) and for hematological malignancies and internal combinations globally. In connection with the Celgene collaboration, we obtained an exclusive license to market Celgene’s approved cancer therapies ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID®, and VIDAZA® in China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which has allowed us to generate product revenue in China since September 2017.  We also obtained Celgene’s commercial operations and personnel in China, which we expect to expand in preparation for the potential launch of our own internally-developed drug candidates and our other in-licensed drug candidates in China.
 We initially started as a research and development company in Beijing in 2010, and have since become a fully-integrated global biopharmaceutical company with operations in China in Beijing, Suzhou, Guangzhou and Shanghai and operations in the United States in Cambridge, MA; Fort Lee, NJ; and Emeryville and San Mateo, CA.  As of January 1, 2018, we had a global team of over 900 employees, including a research team of over 150 employees in Beijing, a clinical team of over 300 employees in the United States, China and Australia, and a growing commercial team of over 200 employees in China. In addition, we have a facility in Suzhou for the manufacture of commercial-scale small molecule and pilot-scale biologics, and another facility under construction in Guangzhou for the manufacture of commercial-scale biologics.

 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to become a global leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative, molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. To achieve our mission, over the last several years we have developed broad internal capabilities from research to global clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization platforms in China. We have a portfolio of cancer therapeutics consisting of three marketed products in China, as well as five development-stage and two development-stage-ready drug candidates, that we plan to continue to expand through both internal research and business development efforts.  In the near term, we are focused on pursuing three significant opportunities:
· | Globally develop and commercialize our lead drug candidate, zanubrutinib, a potentially best-in-class BTK inhibitor. Zanubrutinib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of BTK that is currently being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Our clinical experience to date suggest a potentially best-in-class profile, including a suggestion of deep responses in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, or WM, favorable response rate, depth and durability in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and potentially differentiated activity in combination with the CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, in follicular lymphoma, or FL, and other cancers. In order to pursue this opportunity, we are conducting a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China to build the clinical evidence to maximize potential commercialization opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop and commercialize our investigational checkpoint inhibitor, tislelizumab, in a rapidly and favorably evolving China market. China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world based on revenue, and the oncology sector grew 20% year over year during the last five years, according to McKinsey research. We believe that there is a large and growing opportunity for novel cancer therapeutics in China based on significant unmet medical need, a large target patient population, expanding reimbursement coverage, and increasing patient affordability and willingness to pay. We believe that the market opportunity for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapies in China may be especially attractive, as this class of agents have demonstrated anti-tumor activity in all four of the most common tumors in China: lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancers. Our collaboration with Celgene allows us to have a broad development program targeting both global and China approvals. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity with our strategic Celgene collaboration, our strong presence in China, and our integrated global and China development capabilities.

· | Take advantage of significant regulatory reforms in China that provide access to more than twice the cancer patients available for clinical trials compared to the United States and Europe combined, and allow China to become an integral part of global drug development. Historically, the regulatory environment in China has been considered highly challenging, with clinical development significantly delayed and approval taking much longer than in the United States and Europe. To address these challenges, the China State Council and the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, have issued a series of reform policies and opinions, which, among many things, are expected to expand clinical patient access and expedite development and approval by removing delays and creating an environment with international quality standards for drug development, manufacturing and commercialization in China. We expect that these regulatory reforms will allow China to become an integral part of global drug development programs, and the ability to effectively operate in China and integrate trials conducted in China with those in the rest of the world will be of increasing strategic importance, as it opens up access to more than twice the number of cancer patients in China compared to the United States and Europe combined. We are already taking advantage of the opportunities created by these regulatory reforms by conducting and leading dual-purpose global / China registration trials under our collaboration with Celgene. In addition, we have pursued and plan to continue to pursue business development opportunities, such as our collaboration with Mirati Therapeutics, in which development in China is expected to contribute to, and potentially accelerate, the global development program.

 Our Clinical-Stage Drug Candidates
 Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111), a Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
 Zanubrutinib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of BTK that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Zanubrutinib has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) an approved 

 
  5

 
BTK inhibitor, based on biochemical assays, higher exposure than ibrutinib based on their respective Phase 1 experience in separate studies, and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in both the peripheral blood and lymph node compartments.
 Mechanism of Action
 BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor, or BCR, signaling pathway and is an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block BCR-induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell death in certain malignant white blood cells called B-cells. Zanubrutinib is an orally active inhibitor that covalently binds to BTK, resulting in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.  Market Opportunity and Competition
 Lymphomas are a group of blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, or NHL, and HL. Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas are also characterized as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas make up approximately 85% of NHLs and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. According to the statistics from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, or SEER, program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, there were 72,240 new NHL cases and 20,140 deaths, and 20,110 new CLL cases and 4,660 deaths in 2017 in the United States. According to a published study (Chen et al., Cancer Statistics in China, 2015, CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66(2):115-32), which we refer to as Chen et al. 2016, and GLOBOCAN 2012 analyses on cancer statistics in China, there are an estimated 42,000 to 88,000 new lymphoma cases and 26,000 to 53,000 deaths in China each year.  
 Conventional methods of treating lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology, but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, and, less frequently, radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas, including BTK inhibitors, the PI3K delta inhibitor, idelalisib, and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. In addition, there are other inhibitors of BCR signaling pathways in development, targeting PI3K delta/gamma, IRAK4 and SYK, for example. 
 The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in 2013 for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Since 2013, ibrutinib has received supplemental FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with CLL, CLL patients with 17p deletion, patients with WM, patients with marginal zone lymphoma, or MZL, who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy, and patients with chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. Ibrutinib is also approved by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, for treatment of patients with MCL, CLL, or WM. Ibrutinib has been approved in over 40 countries, and it was approved and launched in China at the end of 2017. Reported global sales of ibrutinib were approximately $3.2 billion in 2017. Another BTK inhibitor, CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib) was approved by the FDA in 2017 under accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
 Summary of Clinical Results
 As of January 29, 2018, we have enrolled more than 1,000 patients and healthy adults in clinical trials of zanubrutinib, including trials of zanubrutinib in combination trials with other therapies, which we refer to as combination trials. A multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trial is being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and South Korea to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary activity of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, including WM, CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, FL, and MCL. The initial results of the dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase of this trial demonstrated that, consistent with zanubrutinib’s pharmacokinetic profile, complete and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in the blood was observed in all tested patients, starting at the lowest dose of 40 mg once daily. In addition, sustained full BTK occupancy was observed in the lymph nodes especially for the 160 mg twice daily dosing regimen.

 Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia 
 On June 15, 2017, we presented data from our Phase 1 trial in patients with WM at the 14th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, Switzerland. As of the data cutoff of March 31, 2017, 48 WM patients were enrolled in the study. Responses were determined according to the modified Sixth International Workshop on WM Criteria.
 Zanubrutinib was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no discontinuation for zanubrutinib-related toxicity. Adverse events, or AEs, were generally mild in severity and self-limited. The most frequent AEs (>10%) of any attribution among 48 patients evaluable for safety were petechiae/purpura/contusion (35%), upper respiratory tract infection (31%), constipation (25%), diarrhea (19%), epistaxis (19%), nausea (17%), cough (15%), anemia (15%), headache (15%), neutropenia (13%), and rash (13%), all of which were grade 1 or 2 in severity except for grade 3 or 4 anemia and neutropenia (8% each) as well as grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and headache (2% each). Five serious adverse events, or SAEs, were assessed to be possibly related to zanubrutinib. These included one case each of hemothorax, atrial fibrillation, colitis, febrile neutropenia, and headache. Among AEs of special interest, there were a total of three cases of atrial fibrillation (all grade 1 or 2), and one case of serious hemorrhage (hemothorax), defined as grade 3 or higher hemorrhage or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade. Three events led to treatment discontinuation, including one case each of bronchiectasis, prostate adenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinoma of pylorus.
 At the time of the data cutoff, 42 patients were evaluable for response. Patients not evaluable for efficacy included two patients with less than 12 weeks of follow-up, three patients with immunoglobulin M, or IgM, < 500mg/dl at baseline, and one patient with inaccurate baseline IgM due to cryoprotein. At a median follow-up of 12.3 months (4.4–30.5 months), the overall response rate, or ORR, was 90% (38/42 patients) and the major response rate was 76% (32/42 patients), with very good partial responses, or VGPRs, in 43% (18/42) of patients and partial responses, or PRs in 33% (14/42) of patients. There were two cases of disease progression.
 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia / Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
 At the same conference, on June 14, 2017, we also presented the data in patients with CLL/SLL from the same trial. As of the data cutoff of March 31, 2017, 69 patients with CLL or SLL (18 treatment naïve, or TN, 51 relapsed/refractory, or R/R) were enrolled in the trial. 
 Zanubrutinib was shown to be generally well-tolerated in CLL/SLL. The most frequent AEs (≥10%) of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (46%), fatigue (29%), upper respiratory tract infection (28%), cough (23%), diarrhea (22%), headache (19%), hematuria (15%), nausea (13%), rash (13%), arthralgia (12%), muscle spasms (12%), and urinary tract infection (12%). All of these events were grade 1 or 2 except for one case of grade 3 purpura (subcutaneous hemorrhage), which was the only major bleeding event. Additional AEs of interest included one case of each grade 2 diarrhea and grade 2 atrial fibrillation. A total of 18 SAEs occurred in 13 patients, with no SAE occurring in more than one patient. Only one patient discontinued treatment due to an AE, a grade 2 pleural effusion.
 At the time of the data cutoff, 66 patients (16 TN and 50 R/R) had more than 12 weeks of follow-up and were evaluable for efficacy, and three other patients had less than 12 weeks of follow-up. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months (2.2–26.8 months), the ORR was 94% (62/66) with complete responses, or CRs, in 3% (2/66), PRs in 82% (54/66), and PRs with lymphocytosis, or PR-Ls, in 9% (6/66) of patients. Stable disease, or SD, was observed in 5% (3/66) of patients. The patient with pleural effusion discontinued treatment prior to week 12 and was not evaluable for response. There was one instance of Hodgkin’s transformation. In TN CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up time of 7.6 months (3.7–11.6 months), the ORR was 100% (16/16) with CRs in 6% (1/16), PRs in 81% (13/16) and PR-Ls in 13% (2/16) of patients. In R/R CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up time of 14.0 months (2.2–26.8 months), the ORR was 92% (46/50) with CRs in 2% (1/50), PRs in 82% (41/50), and PR-Ls in 8% (4/50) of patients. SD was observed in 6% (3/50) patients.

 Other Lymphomas
 On December 9, 2017, we presented additional data from our Phase 1 trial at the 59th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. This dataset included 34 patients in an indolent lymphoma cohort, which consisted of 24 patients with FL and 10 patients with MZL, and 65 patients in an aggressive lymphoma cohort, which consisted of 27 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and 38 patients with MCL. The median follow-up time was 5.6 months (0.3–22.3 months) and 5.1 months (0.1–31.9) for indolent and aggressive lymphoma, respectively.
 As of the data cutoff of September 15, 2017, the most frequent AEs (occurring in ≥15% of patients) of any attribution among 34 patients with indolent lymphoma were petechiae/purpura/contusion (24%), upper respiratory tract infection (21%), nausea (18%) and pyrexia (15%). The most frequently reported grade 3 or greater AEs (occurring in ≥5% of patients) of any attribution were anemia (9%), neutropenia (9%), urinary tract infection (6%), and abdominal pain (6%). SAEs were reported in 11 patients (32%). Of those, four patients had SAEs that were considered possibly related to zanubrutinib, including one case each of nausea, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, and creatinine increase.
 The most frequent AEs (occurring in ≥15% of patients) of any attribution among 65 patients with aggressive lymphoma were petechiae/purpura/contusion (25%), diarrhea (23%), constipation (22%), fatigue (18%), upper respiratory tract infection (18%), anemia (17%), cough (15%), pyrexia (15%), and thrombocytopenia (15%). The most frequently reported grade 3 or greater AEs (occurring in ≥5% of patients) of any attribution were anemia (11%), neutropenia (9%), thrombocytopenia (9%), and pneumonia (6%). SAEs were reported in 26 patients (40%). Of those, three patients had SAEs that were considered possibly related to zanubrutinib, including one case each of peripheral edema and joint effusion (occurring in the same patient), pneumonia, and pneumonitis.
 At the time of data cutoff, 26 patients with indolent lymphoma, including 17 patients with FL and nine patients with MZL, were evaluable for efficacy. In patients with FL, the ORR was 41%, with CRs in 18% and PRs in 24% of patients. SD was observed in 41% of patients. Progressive disease, or PD, was observed in one patient. In patients with MZL, the ORR was 78%, with no CRs and PRs in 78% of patients. SD was observed in 22% of patients. No PD was observed.
 Fifty-eight patients with aggressive lymphoma, including 26 patients with DLBCL and 32 patients with MCL, were evaluable for efficacy. In patients with DLBCL, the ORR was 31%, with CRs in 15% and PRs in 15% of patients. In patients with MCL, the ORR was 88%, with CRs in 25% and PRs in 63% of patients.
 Combination with GAZYVA® (obinutuzumab)
 We are also evaluating zanubrutinib in combination with GAZYVA® (obinutuzumab), an approved anti-CD20 antibody therapy, in patients with B-cell lymphoma in an Phase 1b trial in Australia, the United States, and South Korea. On December 9, 2017, we presented updated preliminary clinical data from this trial at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. As of the data cutoff of September 15, 2017, 45 patients with CLL/SLL and 26 patients with FL were enrolled in the trial. The preliminary Phase 1b data demonstrated that the combination was generally well-tolerated and was highly active in patients with FL and TN or R/R CLL/SLL. 
 At the time of data cutoff, the most common AEs were grades 1 and 2. The most common AEs in patients with CLL/SLL (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (42%), neutropenia (40%), upper respiratory tract infection (36%), fatigue (24%), thrombocytopenia (24%), diarrhea (20%), and pyrexia (20%). The most common AEs in patients with FL (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) of any attribution were upper respiratory tract infection (38%), petechia/purpura/contusion (35%), rash (27%), and thrombocytopenia (23%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs of any attribution reported in ≥ 5% of the CLL/SLL patients included neutropenia (24%) and thrombocytopenia (7%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs of any attribution reported in ≥ 5% of the FL patients included neutropenia (12%). There were no cases of serious hemorrhage, which is ≥ grade 3 hemorrhage or central nervous system hemorrhage of any grade, atrial fibrillation, or grade 3 or above diarrhea. Only one patient with CLL/SLL discontinued treatment due to an AE, a case of squamous cell carcinoma, or SCC, in a patient who had a prior history of SCC. This was also the only patient in the study who had a fatal AE.

 Forty-five patients with CLL/SLL (20 TN and 25 R/R) and 21 patients with R/R FL were evaluable for efficacy. In TN CLL/SLL patients, after a median follow-up of 11.4 months (6.0–17.3 months), the ORR was 95%, with CRs in 35% and PRs in 60% of patients. In R/R CLL/SLL patients, at a median follow-up time of 12.7 months (7.9–19.5 months), the ORR was 92%, with CRs in 20% and PRs in 72% of patients. In R/R FL patients, at a median follow-up time of 12.1 months (0.8–19.7 months), the ORR was 76%, with CRs in 38% and PRs in 38% of patients.
 Combination with Tislelizumab
 We are also evaluating zanubrutinib in combination with our investigational anti-PD1 antibody tislelizumab. The open-label, multi-center Phase 1b trial is being conducted in Australia and is currently in a dose-escalation phase to be followed by a dose-expansion phase. On December 11, 2017, we presented initial data from the ongoing Phase 1b trial at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA. The initial dose-escalation data suggested that the combination of zanubrutinib and tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor activity in patients with B-cell malignancies. As of September 15, 2017, 25 patients had been enrolled. There were 13 patients with indolent lymphoma, including CLL, FL, MZL, and WM, and 12 patients with aggressive lymphoma, including DLBCL, MCL, and transformed lymphoma. The median follow-up time was 5.1 months (0.4–14.1 months). Two cases of autoimmune hemolysis occurred in patients with WM in the dose 2 cohort, and one qualified as a dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT. These events were not associated with a positive direct antiglobulin test and resolved with immunosuppressive therapy, but resulted in the decision to exclude further enrollment of WM patients in the trial. As of the data cutoff date, this autoimmune hemolysis is the only DLT case that was observed.
 Among patients with indolent lymphoma, the most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (31%) and thrombocytopenia (23%). Grade 3 and 4 AEs of any attribution reported in at least two patients included thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hemolysis (15% each).  In addition to the two cases of autoimmune hemolysis, there was one more immune-related event, a grade 4 autoimmune encephalitis. The patient was treated with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy and gradually improved over time.
 Among patients with aggressive lymphoma, the most common AEs (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) of any attribution were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection (33% each), cough (25%), and nausea (25%). Grade 3 and 4 AEs of any attribution reported in at least two patients included pyrexia (17%). There was one patient with multiple occurrences of grade 2 and 3 pneumonitis.  
 At the time of data cutoff, the efficacy-evaluable population consisted of 25 patients. Objective responses were observed in 10 patients (40%). By tumor type, two PRs were observed out of five patients with CLL, one CR and one PR were observed out of five patients with FL, one VGPR and one minor response were observed out of two patients with WM, one CR was observed out of five patients with DLBCL, and three PRs were observed out of five patients with transformed lymphoma.  
 Clinical Development Plan
 Based on the clinical data to date, we believe that zanubrutinib has a potentially best-in-class profile, and we are running a broad global pivotal program in multiple indications.
 Globally, we have an ongoing monotherapy head-to-head Phase 3 trial versus ibrutinib in WM, which is expected to complete enrollment by the end of the third quarter of 2018; an ongoing Phase 3 trial compared to bendamustine and rituximab in patients with TN CLL/SLL; and an ongoing Phase 2 trial in combination with GAZYVA® (obinutuzumab) in patients with FL, which is a pivotal trial for accelerated or conditional approval and will require a confirmatory study. We are also planning a Phase 3 trial for head-to-head comparison versus ibrutinib in patients with R/R CLL/SLL. 
 In China, we are conducting three separate pivotal Phase 2 trials of zanubrutinib as monotherapy in patients with R/R MCL, R/R CLL/SLL, and WM, respectively. We have completed enrollment in the R/R MCL and R/R CLL/SLL pivotal trials. Subject to successful completion of the trial, we plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, in China for patients with MCL in 2018.

 Tislelizumab (BGB-A317), a PD-1 Antibody 
 Tislelizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in pivotal clinical trials globally and in China, and for which we plan to commence additional pivotal trials, as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care to treat various solid and hematological cancers. Tislelizumab is designed to bind to and block downstream activity of PD-1, a cell surface receptor that plays an important role in downregulating the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells. Tislelizumab has high affinity and specificity for PD-1. It is differentiated from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies by an engineered Fc region, which we believe may minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells based on preclinical data. We have a global strategic collaboration with Celgene for tislelizumab for solid tumors outside of Asia (other than Japan) as further described in “—Collaboration Agreements—Celgene”. Mechanism of Action
 Cells called cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, or CTLs, provide humans an important self-defense mechanism against cancer, patrolling the body, recognizing cancer cells due to immunogenic features that differ from normal cells, and killing cancer cells by injecting poisonous proteins into them. T-lymphocytes have various mechanisms built into them that prevent them from damaging normal cells, among which is a protein called PD-1 receptor, which is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes. PD-L1 is an important signaling protein that can engage PD-1. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-lymphocyte and abrogates its cytotoxic effects. Many types of cancer cells have hijacked the PD-L1 expression system that normally exists in healthy cells. By expressing PD-L1, cancer cells protect themselves from being killed by CTLs. Tislelizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1, without activating the receptor, thereby preventing PD-L1 from engaging PD-1. Therefore, we believe tislelizumab has the potential to restore the ability of CTLs to kill cancer cells.  Market Opportunity and Competition
 A number of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs have been approved by the FDA. These include Merck’s  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb’s OPDIVO® (nivolumab), Roche’s TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI® (durvalumab), and Pfizer’s BAVENCIO® (avelumab). Several PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody agents are in clinical development, such as Regeneron’s cemiplimab, Novartis’ PDR-001, Tesaro's TSR042, and Pfizer’s PF-06801591. In 2017, global sales of the PD-1 class exceeded $9 billion according to company reports, which make some of these therapies among the best-selling and fastest launches in history for oncology drugs, confirming the promise of the class.
 We believe there is a large commercial opportunity in China for PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs. Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China, such as lung, gastric, liver and esophageal cancers, are responsive to this class of agents. In 2012, 38%, 45%, 51%, and 49% of the worldwide mortalities from lung, gastric, liver, and esophageal cancers, respectively, occurred in China, according to the World Health Organization. Collectively, these four tumor types comprised over 1.6 million new cases in 2012 in China alone, according to the World Health Organization. In addition, China has a higher proportion of PD-1 responsive tumors in its total cancer population in comparison to other geographies like the United States and the European Union, or EU. According to Chen et al. 2016, the annual incidence of the top 10 PD-1 responsive tumors in China is estimated to be 3 million out of 4.3 million in total annual cancer incidence. In comparison, the estimated annual incidence of the top 10 PD-1 responsive tumors is 0.9 million out of 1.7 million in total annual cancer incidence in the United States, and 0.8 million out of the 1.7 million total in the EU according to SEER program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization. 
 In China, no PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody agents have been approved. The Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, under the CFDA, released guidance in February 2018 on the requirements for NDA submissions of PD-1/L1 agents, specifically for data from single-arm trials on refractory / recurrent advanced cancers without standard-of-care therapies. A pre-NDA meeting is required before NDA submission, and a rolling NDA submission will be accepted for PD-1/L1 therapies. Nivolumab, atezolizumab, and pembrolizumab are in late-stage development in China. Bristol-Myers Squibb submitted an NDA for nivolumab to the CFDA based on interim results from its Phase 3 CheckMate-078 trial in late

2017. Merck submitted an NDA for pembrolizumab in February 2018. Besides us, several domestic China companies also have drug candidates in late-stage clinical development, including Hengrui’s SHR-1210, Innovent’s IBI308, and Junshi’s JS001. 
 Summary of Clinical Results
 As of February 2, 2018, we have enrolled approximately 1,000 patients and healthy adults in clinical trials of tislelizumab, including combination trials. Preliminary data from our monotherapy Phase 1 trials suggested that tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor types.
 A multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trial of tislelizumab as monotherapy in advanced solid tumors is being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Taiwan, and South Korea and consists of dose escalation, schedule-expansion, fixed-dose expansion, and indication expansion in disease-specific cohorts. From 2017 to date, we have presented preliminary data from multiple disease-specific subgroups in the ongoing Phase 1 trial of tislelizumab in advanced solid tumors, including patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, gastric cancer, or GC, esophageal cancer, or EC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, ovarian cancer, or OC, and urothelial cancer, or UC. 
 Hepatocellular (Liver) Cancer
 The data presented on HCC are from 40 patients treated with tislelizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg every three weeks, or Q3W. The majority of the enrolled patients (34/40 patients) had a hepatitis B virus infection. At the time of the data cutoff on April 28, 2017, the median treatment duration was 64 days (range of 1 to 471 days).
 AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 21 patients (53%). Of those, rash (20%), pruritus (13%), increased aspartate aminotransferase, or AST (8%), fatigue (5%), hypothyroidism (5%), and decreased appetite (5%) were reported in more than one patient. All of the treatment-related AEs were grades 1 or 2, with the exception of one grade 5 event of acute hepatitis assessed by the investigator to be related to tislelizumab. This patient had widely metastatic disease and died five weeks after receiving his first and only dose of tislelizumab and subsequently developing evidence of disease progression.
 At the time of the data cutoff, the efficacy evaluation was early, and 27 patients were evaluable for response, defined as having measurable disease at baseline and at least one post-baseline tumor assessment, or progression or death. Twelve of the evaluable patients remained on treatment and the majority (seven) of these had only one tumor assessment at the time of the data cutoff. Confirmed and unconfirmed PRs were observed in three patients, all with hepatitis-B-positive HCC. One PR was confirmed before the cutoff date, one was confirmed one day following the cutoff date, and one was unconfirmed and the patient remained on therapy. Nine patients achieved SD, some of whom also had significant reductions in alpha-fetoprotein levels.
 Gastric and Esophageal Cancers
 The data presented on GC and EC were from 83 patients, 46 with advanced or metastatic GC and 37 with EC, treated with tislelizumab at 2 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg every two weeks, or Q2W, or Q3W. At the time of the data cutoff on June 8, 2017, median treatment duration was 45 days (range 4–457 days) for patients with GC and 50 days (range 1–246 days) for patients with EC.
 AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 15 patients with GC (33%). Of those, abdominal pain (9%), decreased appetite (9%), fatigue (7%), nausea (7%), and pruritus (4%) were reported in more than one patient, and all of these cases were grades 1 or 2. AEs assessed to be treatment-related occurred in 15 patients with EC (41%). Of those, fatigue (16%), nausea (8%), decreased appetite (5%), infusion-related reaction (5%), and myalgia (5%) occurred in more than one patient, and all of these cases were grades 1 or 2. Only one patient in each cohort reported a treatment-related AE of grade 3 or higher: grade 3 proteinuria in one patient with GC and grade 3 dermatitis in one patient with EC. SAEs considered treatment-related included one case of diarrhea and one case of pyrexia, each occurring in patients with GC. Eight patients (two with GC, six with EC) had a treatment-emergent AE with a fatal outcome; none of which were assessed as treatment-related.

 The efficacy-evaluable population included 34 GC patients and 31 EC patients. Despite the short median follow-up time, four achieved confirmed PRs and three achieved SD among GC patients. Among EC patients, two achieved a confirmed PR and nine achieved SD. Three of the nine patients with EC who achieved SD also achieved an unconfirmed PR, including one who awaits response confirmation. At the time of the data cutoff, 27 patients remained on treatment.
 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer 
 The HNSCC data presented were from 18 patients treated with tislelizumab at 5 mg/kg Q3W. At the time of the data cutoff on June 8, 2017, median treatment duration was 104 days (range 30–339 days).
 AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in seven patients (39%). Of those, only fatigue (11%, all grade 1 or 2) was reported in more than one patient. One case of grade 3 nausea was the only treatment-related AE of grade 3 or higher in severity. No patient discontinued treatment due to a treatment-related AE, and of the nine deaths reported, none were considered to be treatment-related.
 The efficacy-evaluable population included 17 HNSCC patients. Despite short median follow-up time, three achieved a confirmed PR and six achieved SD. At the time of the data cutoff, three patients remained on treatment.
 Ovarian Cancer
 The OC dataset included 51 patients treated with tislelizumab at different dose levels (0.5 to 10 mg/kg Q2W in dose escalation, 2 or 5 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W or 200 mg Q3W in dose expansion, or 5 mg/kg Q3W in indication expansion). At the time of the data cutoff on June 8, 2017, median treatment duration was 71 days (range 29–540 days).
 AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 28 patients (55%). Of those, fatigue (18%), pruritus (10%), rash (10%), diarrhea (10%), lethargy (6%), nausea (6%), abdominal pain (4%), dry eye (4%), dry skin (4%), onychoclasis (4%), and maculo-papular rash (4%) were reported in more than one patient, and all, except one case of grade 3 diarrhea, were grades 1 or 2. Two additional treatment-related AEs of grade 3 or higher included one case each of grade 3 pyrexia and stomatitis. SAEs considered to be treatment-related occurred in three patients and included one case each of pyrexia, colitis, and mucosal inflammation.
 The efficacy-evaluable population included 50 OC patients. Two achieved a confirmed PR and 20 achieved SD. At the time of the data cutoff, six patients remained on treatment.
 Urothelial Cancer
 The UC dataset included 16 patients. Of these, 12 had one or more prior systemic anticancer treatment for metastatic disease and the remaining four had progressed after receiving platinum-based regimen in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. In addition, five patients had prior radiotherapy. At the time of the data cutoff on August 28, 2017, median treatment duration was 4.3 months (range of 0.7 to 18.3 months). A total of six patients remained on treatment.
 AEs assessed by the investigator to be treatment-related occurred in 14 patients (88%). Of those, fatigue (31%), rash (19%), infusion-related reactions (13%), nausea (13%), pain in extremity (13%), and proteinuria (13%) occurred in more than one patient. All of the treatment-related AEs were grade 1 or 2 except one case each of fatigue, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus. One AE of muscle weakness, which was associated with disease progression and occurred more than one month after the last dose of tislelizumab, had a fatal outcome. This event was considered by the investigator to not be treatment-related.
 The efficacy-evaluable population included 15 UC patients. One patient had a confirmed CR, four achieved a confirmed PR, and three achieved SD. Nine evaluable patients had PD-L1 status determined. There was one CR, two PR and one SD among six PD-L1 high patients, and one PR among three PD-L1 low or negative patients.

 Combination with Pamiparib
 On June 5, 2017, we presented initial data from the dose-escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial of tislelizumab in combination with our investigation PARP inhibitor, pamiparib, in patients with advanced solid tumors at the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. We presented an updated dataset on January 25, 2018 at the 2018 ASCO-SITC Clinical Immuno-Oncology Symposium. The preliminary data suggested that the combination of tislelizumab and pamiparib was generally well-tolerated and showed anti-tumor activity in multiple solid tumor types.
 At the data cutoff of July 31, 2017, 49 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation portion of the trial. Cohorts of six to 13 patients each received treatments at five planned dose levels, or DLs. Tislelizumab was administered at 2 mg/kg Q3W with pamiparib at 20, 40, or 60 mg twice daily, or BID, in DLs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Tislelizumab was also administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg Q3W with pamiparib at 40 or 60 mg twice daily in DLs 4 and 5, respectively. Duration of treatment was greater than 200 days for 10 patients, and a total of seven patients remained on treatment as of the data cutoff date. 
 Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in four patients; these included one patient with grade 2 nausea, one patient with grade 3 rash at DL 4, one patient with grade 2 nausea or vomiting and one patient with grade 4 autoimmune hepatitis at DL 5. The trial identified the recommended Phase 2 dose to be tislelizumab at 200 mg fixed dose Q3W and pamiparib at 40 mg BID. 
 Grade 3 or 4 non-immune AEs assessed by the investigator to be related to the treatment regimen and reported in more than one patient included anemia (12%), nausea (4%) and fatigue (4%). Immune-related AEs of any grade regardless of causality occurred in 23 patients (47%); those reported in at least two patients included elevated alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, elevated AST, hypothyroidism, auto-immune hepatitis / hepatitis, diarrhea, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase, or GGT, hyperthyroidism, and pruritus. Grade 3 and 4 liver-related AEs regardless of causality were reported in nine patients, including five patients with hepatitis and four patients with ALT, AST, and/or GGT elevations. Together, liver-related AEs of any grade regardless of causality were observed in 13 patients; all events were manageable and reversible with corticosteroid treatment. The trial protocol was amended to increase real-time hepatic safety monitoring consistent with new European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, guidance for immune-related treatment-emergent AEs.
  At the data cutoff of July 31, 2017, 49 patients were evaluable for efficacy. Best responses included two confirmed CRs, five confirmed PRs, and seven unconfirmed PRs. The clinical benefit rate including CRs, PRs and durable SDs with at least 24 weeks was 31%. With longer follow-up, as of January 4, 2018, among the 49 evaluable patients, best responses included two confirmed CRs, eight confirmed PRs, and four unconfirmed PRs. The clinical benefit rate was 39%. As of the July 31, 2017 cutoff, 11 patients remained on treatment, the median duration of response was 168.5 days (range: 64-508 days), and duration of treatment was over 200 days in 10 patients.
 The trial is currently planned to further evaluate the combination’s activity in expansion cohorts of patients with ovarian, triple-negative breast, castration-resistant prostate, lung, gastric / gastro-esophageal junction, urothelial, and pancreatic cancers.
 Clinical Development Plan
 We are running a broad development program with Celgene including global pivotal trials in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, GC, EC, and HCC, which are intended to support regulatory submissions globally and in China. We have initiated Phase 3 trials to evaluate tislelizumab as a potential second-line or third-line treatment compared to docetaxel in patients with NSCLC; as a potential first line treatment compared to sorafenib in patients with HCC; and as a potential second-line treatment compared to investigator-chosen chemotherapy in patients with esophageal SCC. We and Celgene expect to commence additional pivotal trials in 2018 and 2019.

 In China, we have two additional China-specific pivotal trials ongoing, in patients with R/R HL and in patients with PD-L1 positive urothelial cancer. The trial in HL has completed enrollment. Subject to successful completion of the trial, we plan to submit a NDA in China for patients with HL in 2018.
 Pamiparib (BGB-290), a PARP Inhibitor    Pamiparib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 that is being evaluated as a potential monotherapy and in combinations for the treatment of various solid tumors. We believe pamiparib has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP inhibitors because of its potential brain penetration, greater selectivity, strong DNA-trapping activity, and good oral bioavailability. Pamiparib has demonstrated pharmacological properties such as brain penetration and PARP–DNA complex trapping in preclinical models. 
 Mechanism of Action
 PARP family members PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in DNA replication and transcriptional regulation and play essential roles in cell survival in response to DNA damage. PARP1 and PARP2 are key base-excision-repair proteins that function as DNA damage sensors by binding rapidly to the site of damaged DNA and modulating a variety of proteins in DNA repair processes. Inhibition of PARPs prevents the repair of common single-strand DNA breaks which leads to formation of double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Double-strand DNA breaks in normal cells are repaired by homologous recombination, and normal cells are relatively tolerant of PARP inhibition. On the other hand, cancer cells with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene, or BRCA1/2 genes, which are key players in homologous recombination, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition. This phenomenon is called “synthetic lethality” and is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors as a monotherapy for BRCA mutant cancers. In addition to hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations, the synthetic lethality concept has been broadened to include sporadic tumors that display homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, a gene expression profile that resembles that of a BRCA deficient tumor. HRD can stem from somatic mutation of BRCA1/2, epigenetic silencing of BRCA genes or genetic or epigenetic loss of function of other genes in homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathways. Third-party clinical studies have published results demonstrating that sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in OC as well. Thus, the application of PARP inhibitors is likely broader than BRCA or HRD mutations, and there is additional possibility to identify and enrich patient populations for PARP inhibition. 
 Another potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is rational combination therapy. PARP proteins are key factors in DNA repair pathways, in particular, base-excision-repair, which is critical for the repair of DNA lesions caused by some chemotherapeutic agents and by radiation. PARP inhibitors are hypothesized to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum compounds, temozolomide and ionizing radiation and may be used in combination with these agents in treating various cancers. PARP inhibitors are also considered good potential combination partners with checkpoint inhibitors in part due to increased mutations in tumor cells as a result of the blockade of DNA repair by PARP inhibitors. 
 Market Opportunity and Competition
 We believe that the market opportunity for PARP inhibitors is large and expanding in various tumor histologies, settings and patient segments. Many tumor types have been shown to be responsive to PARP inhibitors, including OC, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and GC. PARP inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging activities both in relapsed and refractory patients as well as in the maintenance setting. In the United States, each year there are approximately 22,440 new cases of OC, 252,710 new cases of breast cancer, 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer, and 28,000 new cases of GC, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute. In China, each year there are approximately 52,000 new cases of OC, 272,000 new cases of breast cancer, 60,000 new cases of prostate cancer, and 680,000 new cases of GC according to Chen et al. 2016.
 A number of PARP inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. These include AstraZeneca’s LYNPARZA® (olaparib), Clovis Oncology’s RUBRACA® (rucaparib), and Tesaro’s ZEJULA® (niraparib). Several PARP inhibitors are in late-stage clinical development besides pamiparib, including AbbVie’s veliparib and Pfizer’s talazoparib. In 2017, global sales of the PARP class exceeded $400 million according to company reports. In China, AstraZeneca has 

 
  14

 
submitted an NDA for olaparib. In addition, Zai Lab obtained the development and commercial rights for niraparib in China, and is currently running a Phase 1 pharmacokinetics study and a Phase 3 pivotal trial as a potential maintenance treatment after two lines of platinum therapy in patients with OC. There are also some PARP inhibitors being developed by domestic Chinese companies, including fluzoparib from Hengrui / Hansoh.  
 Summary of Clinical Data 
 As of February 6, 2018, we have enrolled approximately 200 patients in clinical trials of pamiparib, including combination trials. 
 A multi-center, open-label Phase 1/2 trial of pamiparib is being conducted in Australia in patients with advanced solid tumors. On September 8, 2017, we presented preliminary clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of pamiparib in patients with advanced solid tumors at the ESMO 2017 Congress. As of June 1, 2017, 68 patients were enrolled in the trial. The median duration of therapy for all patients was 79 days (range 1 to 926 days). At the time of the data cutoff, 20 patients remained on treatment.

The median duration of therapy for all patients was 79 days (range 1–926 days). At the time of the data cutoff, 20 patients remained on treatment.
 The safety analysis suggested that pamiparib was generally well-tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors. AEs assessed to be treatment-related occurred in 78% of patients and were all grade 3 or lower in severity. The most common treatment-related AEs (≥10% of patients) were nausea (56%), fatigue (40%), anemia (25%), vomiting (21%), diarrhea (21%), decreased appetite (15%), and neutropenia or neutrophil count decrease (12%). SAEs occurred in 46% of patients, and SAEs considered to be treatment-related and occurring in more than one patient included two cases each of nausea and anemia. Four patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-emergent AEs. Four patients had a treatment-emergent AE with a fatal outcome, none were assessed as being treatment-related and all of which were associated with disease progression.
 At the time of the data cutoff, 39 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, or EOC, or associated tumors such as fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers were evaluable for efficacy. Among this group, there were three confirmed CRs, 10 confirmed PRs, and 21 cases of SD. Of the 23 evaluable patients with EOC or other associated tumors known to be BRCA-mutated, there were three CRs, seven PRs, and 10 cases of SD. Complete and partial responses were observed in patients known to be platinum-resistant as well as patients with platinum-sensitive disease. 
 Clinical Development Plan
 In addition to the ongoing Phase 2 trial of pamiparib in combination with tislelizumab, we are currently conducting two other global combination trials: a Phase 1b/2 trial of pamiparib with radiation therapy and/or temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma and a Phase 1b/2 trial of pamiparib with temozolomide in patients with advanced tumors such as OC, triple negative breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and GC. We plan to initiate a global Phase 3 pivotal trial in patients with GC in the first half of 2018.
 In China, we are conducting a Phase 2 pivotal trial in patients with gBRCA-positive OC who have received at least two prior lines of therapy in advanced or metastatic setting. We also plan to initiate a Phase 3 trial of pamiparib as a maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC in 2018.
 Lifirafenib (BGB-283), a RAF Dimer Inhibitor
 Lifirafenib is an investigational novel small molecule inhibitor with RAF monomer and dimer inhibition activities. Lifirafenib has shown antitumor activities in preclinical models and in cancer patients in tumors with BRAF V600E mutations, non-V600E BRAF mutations and KRAS/NRAS mutations. We have been developing lifirafenib for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway, including BRAF gene mutations and KRAS/NRAS gene mutations where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. The MAPK 

 
  15

 
pathway consists of proteins in the cell that transmit a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. This pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. We believe that lifirafenib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents may have a potential for treating various malignancies, such as melanoma, NSCLC, and endometrial cancer. 
 Roche’s ZELBORAF® (vemurafenib) and Novartis’ TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) are two of the currently approved BRAF inhibitors for treating late-stage BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma. In addition, the combination of dabrafenib and GSK’s MEKINIST® (trametinib), an MEK inhibitor, as well vemurafenib and COTELLIC® (cobimeditinib), another MEK inhibitor, are approved in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. We are aware of several other BRAF inhibitors in clinical development targeting BRAF V600E/K mutated cancers including melanoma, NSCLC, hairy cell leukemia and thyroid cancer. These BRAF inhibitors include Array Biopharma's encorafenib, currently in Phase 3 trials, and Takeda's MLN-2480 (BIIB-024) and TAK-580, Daiichi Sankyo's PLX-8394, Roche's RG-6185, Genentech’s HM95573, and Novartis’ LXH254 in Phase 1 trials.
 Currently approved first-generation BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are only active against the BRAF monomer. Because lifirafenib is designed to inhibit both the monomer and dimer forms of RAF, we believe lifirafenib has the potential to be a first-in-class RAF dimer inhibitor. Lifirafenib was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 trial conducted in Australia and New Zealand comprised of two parts — dose escalation and dose expansion — in patients with BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutated solid tumors or patients with pancreatic cancer. Lifirafenib demonstrated activity in both BRAF and KRAS-mutated tumors in preclinical studies and in the dose-escalation portion of this Phase 1 trial. 
 We presented data from the dose-expansion portion of the trial at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. The dose-expansion portion of the trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lifirafenib at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 30 mg once daily established in the dose-escalation part of the trial. In the dose-expansion portion, lifirafenib was generally well-tolerated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and continued to show antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors and patients with KRAS-mutated solid tumors. The safety analysis, which included 96 patients as of the September 12, 2016 cutoff, suggested that lifirafenib was generally well-tolerated at 30 mg once daily, with most drug-related AEs being grades 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent drug-related AEs (≥10%) of any grade were fatigue (38.5%), dysphonia (26.0%), decreased appetite (21.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (21.9%), thrombocytopenia (19.8%), dermatitis acneiform (17.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), rash (16.7%), nausea (15.6%), hypertension (11.5%), and glossodynia (10.4%). The most frequent drug-related grade 3 and 4 AEs (≥2%, two patients or more) included fatigue (7.3%), hypertension (6.3%), thrombocytopenia (6.3%), pyrexia (3.1%), hyponatremia (2.1%), anemia (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), febrile neutropenia (2.1%), decreased platelet count (2.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase (2.1%), increased GGT (2.1%), and sepsis (2.1%). 
 The cutoff for the efficacy analysis was September 17, 2016. In seven patients with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma (including one V600K and one V600R) who were naïve to BRAF or MEK inhibitors, there were three PRs and three cases of SD. In three patients with BRAF V600-mutated PTC, there was one PR and two cases of SD. In six patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC, there was one PR and two cases of SD. In ten patients with solid tumors with BRAF non-V600 mutations or solid tumors with BRAF V600 mutations that are not included in other cohorts, there were two PRs, in one patient with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma and one with BRAF V600E-mutated OC, and three cases of SD. In two patients with BRAF V600-mutated NSCLC, there was one unconfirmed PR and one case of SD. Additional cases of SD were observed in four of six melanoma patients with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma who had responses to but developed resistance against BRAF or MEK inhibitors, nine of 13 patients with BRAF V600-mutated CRC, five of five patients with KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer, 12 of 20 patients with KRAS/NRAS-mutated CRC, and 10 of 21 patients with other KRAS/NRAS-mutated solid tumors or pancreatic cancer. In the Phase 1a portion of the trial, confirmed objective responses included a complete response in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma and two PRs, one in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated thyroid cancer and one in a patient with KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer.

 BGB-A333, a PD-L1 Inhibitor
 BGB-A333 is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, the ligand of PD-1. We intend to develop BGB-A333 either as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies, such as tislelizumab, to treat various cancers and potentially other indications. BGB-A333 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia to test the safety and anti-tumor effect of BGB-A333 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
 Sitravatinib (MGCD-0516), a Multi-Kinase Inhibitor
 In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., or Mirati, for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Mirati’s sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia, and New Zealand. Sitravatinib is an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases, including RET, TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, MER), and split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT). Sitravatinib is being evaluated by Mirati as a single agent in a dose-expansion trial in patients whose tumors harbor specific genetic alterations in NSCLC and other tumor types. Sitravatinib has shown encouraging interim results in an ongoing Phase 2 trial in combination with nivolumab in NSCLC patients who have progressed after prior treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. We plan to investigate sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab in China and the licensed territory.
 Under the license agreement, Mirati retains exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of sitravatinib outside of the licensed territory. We made an upfront cash payment of $10 million to Mirati and agreed to pay up to $123 million based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as royalties at tiered percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to twenty percent on annual net sales of sitravatinib in the licensed territory, subject to reduction under specified circumstances. 
 CC-122, a Cereblon Modulator
 CC-122 is an investigational next-generation Cereblon modulator currently in clinical development by Celgene. It is in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials, both as a single agent and in combination, for hematological and solid tumor cancers outside of China. CC-122 has been differentiated from previous compounds (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and has been developed based on the scientific understanding of Cereblon-mediated protein homeostasis. 
 In August 2017, we entered into a license and supply agreement with Celgene, pursuant to which we were granted a license to develop and commercialize CC-122 in China. See “—Collaboration Agreements—Celgene.” 
 Our Commercial Products
 We commercialize the following cancer drugs in China under an exclusive license from Celgene.
 ABRAXANE®
 ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free chemotherapy product which was developed using Celgene’s proprietary nab® technology platform. This protein-bound chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin. Globally, ABRAXANE® is approved for uses in breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and GC with geographic differences in labeling. In China, ABRAXANE® is approved for metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.
 According to Chen et al. 2016, there were approximately 4.3 million new cancer cases and 2.8 million cancer deaths in China in 2015, with breast cancer as the most common tumor type in Chinese women. It is estimated that in 2015 breast cancer affected 268,600 women and resulted in 69,500 deaths. Targeted therapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are three main strategies to treat different types of breast cancer.

 Taxane is the backbone chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer, Her2+ or aggressive estrogen-receptor-positive and/or progesterone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients. ABRAXANE® is the only currently approved taxane that does not need pre-medication of dexamethasone to prevent hypersensitivity reactions, and several Phase 3 trials have demonstrated its efficacy and safety compared to solvent-based taxanes in both metastatic breast cancer and neo-adjuvant settings. Unlike other taxanes, ABRAXANE® has demonstrated unique and strong efficacy in pancreatic cancer and has become the backbone of first line standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer globally.
 The taxanes marketed in China include two branded solvent-based paclitaxel (TAXOL® and ANZATAX), one branded docetaxel (TAXOTERE®), one lipsome-paclitaxel (LIPUSU), one albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) and dozens of generic taxanes. LIPUSU is currently the market leader with approximately one-third of the value share.  
 In 2017, ABRAXANE® held an estimated 5.4% value share in the taxane market in China. In February 2018, a generic albumin-bound paclitaxel from CSPC Pharmaceutical Group was approved by the CFDA. Another generic form of albumin-bound paclitaxel from Hengrui is under review by the CFDA.  
 In 2018, we plan to seek to differentiate and defend ABRAXANE® against generic competition in China, expand our sales force footprint and hospital coverage, and improve patient access through critical illness insurance negotiations and provincial reimbursement listings.  
 REVLIMID®
 REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is an oral immunomodulatory drug that was approved by the CFDA in China in 2013 for the treatment of multiple myeloma, or MM, in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. On February 2, 2018, REVLIMID® received CFDA approval of a new indication for the treatment of MM in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for transplant. Chinese guidelines recommend lenalidomide as a standard of care for the treatment of R/R and newly diagnosed MM as well as in the maintenance setting.  
 MM is a malignant plasma cell disease whose tumor cells originate in plasma cells in the bone marrow, which are cells in which B-lymphocytes develop to the final functional phase. The current World Health Organization classifies it as a B-cell lymphoma, also known as plasma cell myeloma / plasmacytoma. MM is characterized by abnormal proliferation of bone marrow plasma cells accompanied by overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin, or M protein. MM is often accompanied by multiple osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, anemia, and kidney damage. Due to the inhibition of normal immunoglobulin production, patients are prone to a variety of bacterial infections.
 At present, MM is one of the most common malignant tumors in the blood system and occurs frequently in the elderly. The actual incidence increases with age, peaking from 60 to 70 years of age. Men suffer slightly more than women. Globally, the incidence was estimated at 2 to 3 per 100,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1, and most patients are over 40 years old, according to Siegel et al., 2011 and IMS analysis. It is estimated that the incidence rate of MM is approximately 1-2 per 100,000 people in China, or approximately 18,000 new patients in 2017, out of which 10,000 are in urban populations, according to Lu et al., 2014, IMS analysis, and local market research. With a growing aging population and improving diagnosis, China has seen a steady increase in MM incidence.
 Although MM cannot be cured, the progression of the disease can be controlled. The purpose of treatment is to extend patients’ survival and improve quality of life. The main treatments for MM in China include VELCADE®, which is a proteasome inhibitor marketed by Johnson and Johnson in China since 2006, generic thalidomide and REVLIMID®. VELCADE® currently dominates the market in first-line MM treatment in China, while VELCADE® and REVLIMID® share the market in the second line. The first lenalidomide generic and first bortezomib generic in China were approved in November 2017. Another new agent for R/R MM, ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor developed by Takeda, is currently under regulatory review in China.
 In 2017, the patient share for REVLIMID® in second-line MM in the top 30 hospitals in China rose from an estimated 36% to 47%. REVLIMID® achieved national reimbursement drug listing, or NRDL, through a successful price negotiation with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in June 2017.

 VIDAZA®
 VIDAZA® (azacitidine for injection) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA was approved in China in April 2017 for the treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, chronic myelomonocyte leukemia, or CMML, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with 20% to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia. In January 2018, VIDAZA®, became commercially available in China.
 MDS are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and therefore do not become healthy blood cells. Approximately seven per 100,000 people are affected with approximately four per 100,000 people newly acquiring the condition each year globally according to Germing et al., 2013. The typical age of onset is 70 years. The higher-risk MDS (intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS) is fatal because the median overall survival rate is only 0.4-1.1 years and nearly 30% of these patients progress to AML, according to the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer network, or NCCN, MDS guideline 2013 and MDS Foundation. DNA methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation, but aberrant DNA hypermethylation can result in gene silencing. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes promotes cancer development and progression. MDS patients display aberrant DNA methylation of thousands of genes, which increases with advanced disease and is a poor prognostic factor. 
 In China, the main treatments for intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS are conventional care regimen, or CCR (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine and intensive chemotherapy), and hypomethylating agents, or HMAs. DACOGEN® (decitabine) marketed by Johnson and Johnson was the first HMA agent approved in China in 2009. In the past several years, at least six decitabine generics have become available. In 2017, decitabine was listed in the NRDL. Nevertheless, there are still over 50% of higher-risk MDS patients treated by CCR and the unmet need remains large. 
 VIDAZA® is the only approved HMA shown to prolong survival for patients with MDS. Besides reversing the effects of DNA hypermethylation, VIDAZA® inhibits protein synthesis via RNA incorporation. VIDAZA® is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the U.S. NCCN guideline. It is also a first-line recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the Chinese MDS treatment guidelines.
 Our Preclinical Programs 
 We have a proprietary cancer biology platform that has also allowed us to develop our clinical-stage drug candidates and several additional preclinical-stage drug candidates in potentially important areas. These currently consist of targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents, including an additional RAF dimer inhibitor, a TIM-3 cell surface protein monoclonal antibody, and a BTK inhibitor for non-oncology indications. We anticipate advancing one or more of our preclinical assets into the clinic in the next 12 months. We believe we have the opportunity to combine tislelizumab with our preclinical candidates to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. We also may seek to develop companion diagnostics that will help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the use of our drug candidates. Manufacturing and Supply 
 We have an approximately 11,000 square meter manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, where we produce small molecule and biologics drug candidates for clinical supply and which we plan to use for commercial supply of our small molecule drug candidates, if approved. This facility consists of one oral-solid-dosage production line for small molecule drug products and one pilot plant for monoclonal antibody drug substances. In January 2018, the facility received a manufacturing license from the provincial FDA, which is required for the commercial manufacturing of zanubrutinib in China following NDA approval. 
 In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Guangzhou Development District and its affiliate, Guangzhou GET Technology Development Co., Ltd., to build a 24,000-liter commercial-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China. Over $300 million in funding will be provided for construction of the 100,000 square meter manufacturing site and for research and development of biologic drug candidates in China. We have contracted with 

 
  19

 
General Electric for the purchase of its state-of-the-art KuBio™ prefabricated biomanufacturing equipment and commenced construction in 2017. We expect the first phase of the facility to be completed and operational in 2019.
 We also have an approximately 140 square meter manufacturing facility at our research and development facilities in Beijing, China, which produces preclinical and clinical trial materials for some of our small molecule drug candidates. 
 We outsource to a limited number of external contract manufacturers the production of some drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical, clinical, and potential commercial requirements of our drugs and drug candidates. We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short-term and project-by-project basis. For example, we have an agreement with a contract manufacturer for clinical supply of zanubrutinib and expect to enter into a commercial supply agreement for zanubrutinib in the future. In addition, in January 2018, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals (China) Ltd., or Boehringer Ingelheim, for our investigational anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, tislelizumab, which will be manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim’s facility in Shanghai, China as part of a marketing authorization holder, or MAH, trial project pioneered by us and Boehringer Ingelheim. Under the terms of the commercial supply agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim will manufacture tislelizumab in China under an exclusive multi-year arrangement, with contract extension possible. In addition, we also obtained certain preferred rights for future capacity expansion by Boehringer Ingelheim in China. For our commercial products licensed from Celgene, we rely on Celgene and its contract manufacturers outside of China for the supply of these drugs.
 Currently, we obtain raw materials for our manufacturing activities from multiple suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, a risk exists that an interruption supplies would materially harm our business. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements governing recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our manufacturing facilities and the contract manufacturing organizations we use to manufacture our drugs and drug candidates operate under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.

 The term of the China License Agreement is 10 years and may be terminated by either party upon written notice in the event of uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, or if the underlying regulatory approvals for the covered products are revoked. Celgene Logistics also has the right to terminate the agreement with respect to REVLIMID® at any time upon written notice to the Company.
 The China License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and confidentiality and mutual indemnification provisions.
 On August 31, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, BeiGene (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd., acquired 100% of the equity interests of Celgene Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Celgene Shanghai, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Holdings East Corporation established under the laws of China. This company, which we subsequently renamed BeiGene Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., is in the business of, among other things, providing marketing and promotional services for the pharmaceutical products that we license from Celgene. Prior to closing, Celgene separated out certain business functions, including regulatory and drug safety, that continue to support the business acquired by us. 
 Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany 
 Pamiparib
 On October 28, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany, which we refer to respectively as the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement and the PRC PARP Agreement, pursuant to which (a) we granted to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop and manufacture, and, if Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercised a continuation option, to commercialize and manufacture pamiparib and any other compound covered by the same existing patent rights with primary activity to inhibit PARP 1, 2 or 3 enzymes, or the Licensed PARP Inhibitors, in the Ex-PRC Territory, and (b) Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed PARP Inhibitors in the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC, which we refer to as the PRC Territory.

 
  21

 

 On October 1, 2015, pursuant to a purchase of rights agreement, we repurchased all of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany's rights under the Ex-PRC PARP Agreement, in consideration for, among other things, a one-time payment of $10 million and reduction of future milestone payments we were eligible for under the PRC PARP Agreement. In connection with that repurchase, we also agreed to provide Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany with global access to our clinical PARP supplies, including pamiparib, for its combination trials, during the option period. The Ex-PRC PARP Agreement was terminated, except for certain provisions that are needed to effectuate the continuation of the PRC PARP Agreement, including those provisions that were required in the event that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercised its PRC Commercialization Option (described below).
 Pursuant to the PRC PARP Agreement, if we failed to achieve national priority project status in the PRC Territory under its 12th or 13th five-year plan with respect to our pamiparib program in the PRC Territory by July 28, 2017, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany has an option to acquire exclusive commercialization rights under the pamiparib program in the PRC Territory, which we refer to as the PRC Commercialization Option. If, however, we achieved national priority by July 28, 2017, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany only has a right of first negotiation to acquire exclusive commercialization rights under the pamiparib program in the PRC Territory in the event we seek to license our intellectual property rights to a third party. We applied for national priority project status for pamiparib to be effective from the beginning of 2017, and our application is in process and we believe that it will be approved.  However, there have been unanticipated governmental delays that have impacted the 2017 applicant pool for national project priority status and we expect that we will now receive formal notification in 2018.  As such, we intend to discuss with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany the impact of this delay on the PRC Commercialization Option.  
 Under the agreements, we are eligible to receive up to $7 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones in the PRC Territory. In addition, if Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany exercises the PRC Commercialization Option, it is required to pay us a $50 million non-refundable payment upon such exercise, and we are eligible for a $12.5 million milestone payment upon the successful achievement of a certain additional regulatory event in the PRC Territory. Also, in consideration for the licenses granted to us, we are required to pay Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of Licensed PARP Inhibitors in the PRC Territory. 
 The PRC PARP Agreement continues unless terminated as permitted by either party. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany has the right to terminate due to our uncured breach or for convenience upon prior written notice. We have the right to terminate these agreements due to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany's uncured breach or for any challenge brought against our licensed patent rights.
 Lifirafenib
 On May 24, 2013, we entered into license agreements with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany for lifirafenib, which were amended in 2013 and 2015 and which we refer to respectively as the Ex-PRC BRAF Agreement and PRC BRAF Agreement. In March 2017, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany informed us that it would not exercise a continuation option in the ex-PRC territory, and thus, the ex-PRC BRAF Agreement terminated in its entirety, except for certain provisions that survive termination. Under the PRC BRAF Agreement, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany granted us an exclusive license under certain of its intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the RAF dimer inhibitor in the PRC, which we refer to as the PRC Territory, subject to certain non-compete restrictions. Further, pursuant to the PRC BRAF Agreement, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany has an exclusive right of first negotiation to acquire exclusive commercialization rights under the lifirafenib BRAF program in the PRC Territory on terms to be mutually agreed in the event we seek to license our intellectual property rights to a third party in the territory. 
 Under these agreements, in December 2013, we received $13 million in non-refundable payments. As of December 31, 2017, we have received $9 million in milestone payments. We are eligible to receive an additional $14 million in payments upon the successful achievement of pre-specified clinical milestones in the PRC Territory. We are required to pay Merck KGaA, Darmstadt Germany a high single-digit royalty on aggregate net sales of the licensed compounds in the PRC Territory.  

 
  22

 

 The term of the PRC BRAF Agreement continues unless terminated as permitted by either party. Under the PRC BRAF Agreement, Merck KGaA has the right to terminate due to our uncured breach or voluntarily upon prior written notice. We have the right to terminate the PRC BRAF Agreement due to Merck KGaA’s uncured breach or for any challenge brought against our licensed patent rights. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and their methods of use are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel medicines, as described in more detail below. We have obtained U.S. patents and filed patent applications in the United States and other countries relating to certain of our drug candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for other of our drug candidates and technologies. We rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection including our manufacturing processes. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and support our development programs.
 As of February 19, 2018, we own 14 issued U.S. patents, nine pending U.S. patent applications, provisional applications, and corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, we own 10 pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, which we plan to file nationally in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as additional priority PCT applications. With respect to any issued patents in the United States and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date provided we meet the applicable requirements for obtaining such patent term extensions. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting an NDA approval from the FDA. The patent portfolios for our four leading product candidates as of February 19, 2018 are summarized below:
 Zanubrutinib.  We own one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, two PCT applications, and corresponding patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to zanubrutinib, a small molecule BTK inhibitor, combinations of zanubrutinib with other therapeutic agents, and its use for the treatment of hematological malignancies. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patent is 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2034, not including any patent term adjustments. If a U.S. application is filed based on the pending PCT applications, a patent issuing from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2037. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
 Tislelizumab.  We are the owner of two issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. application, two pending PCT applications, and corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to tislelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, and its use for the treatment of cancer. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents is 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2033, not including any patent term adjustments. If a U.S. application is filed based on the pending PCT applications, any patent issuing from the applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2038. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
 Pamiparib.  We own two issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, and two pending PCT applications directed to pamiparib, a small molecule PARP1/2 inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including glioblastomas and breast cancer. We also own the corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent application would be expected to expire in 2031, not including any patent term adjustments. If a U.S. application is filed based on the pending PCT applications, patents issuing from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2036 and 2037. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

 
  23

 

 Lifirafenib.  We own two issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, and one pending PCT application directed to lifirafenib, a small molecule BRAF inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including BRAF mutated cancers. We also own pending patent applications in other jurisdictions corresponding to the U.S. patent applications. In addition, we plan to file nationally in the U.S. and other jurisdictions based on the pending PCT application. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from the currently pending U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire in 2031 and 2036, not including any patent term adjustments. If a U.S. application is filed based on the pending PCT application, a patent issuing from this application, if any, would be expected to expire in 2037. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
 The patent portfolios for our three in-licensed commercial products in China as of January 31, 2018 are summarized below:
 ABRAXANE®.  We are the exclusive licensor of five issued Chinese patents and four pending Chinese patent applications directed to ABRAXANE®, a nanoparticle albumin–bound paclitaxel, and its use for the treatment of cancer. The expected expirations for the issued Chinese patents are 2018, 2021, 2026, and 2031 respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. Any patent that may issue from the currently pending Chinese patent applications would be expected to expire in 2023, 2026, or 2034.  In February 2018, a generic version of albumin-bound palclitaxel was approved in China and another is currently under regulatory review.

REVLIMID®.  We are the exclusive licensor of seven issued Chinese patents directed to REVLIMID®, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including MM. The expected expirations for the issued Chinese patents are 2023 and 2027 respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. The first lenalidomide generic in China was approved in November 2017.

VIDAZA®.  We do not have any rights in any issued China patent or pending China patent applications directed to VIDAZA®, a chemical analog of cytidine, and its use for the treatment of cancer.  We are aware of third parties who are seeking to develop and obtain approval for generic forms of this drug.
 Under our license agreement with Celgene, Celgene retains the responsibility for, but is not obligated, to prosecute, defend and enforce the patents for these in-licensed products. As such, any issued patents may not protect us from generic competition for these drugs.
 The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States and China, the term of an issued patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened in some cases by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in excess of a patent applicant’s own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval.
 In certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country by country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of any patent term extensions or adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect aspects of our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

 Additionally, we currently own a number of registered trademarks and pending trademark applications. We currently have registered trademarks for BeiGene and our corporate logo in China, the European Union and other jurisdictions and are seeking trademark protection for BeiGene and our corporate logo in the United States and other countries where available and appropriate.

Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing and export and import of drugs such as those we are developing and commercializing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 U.S. Regulation 
 U.S. Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. 
 Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line or third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small molecule drugs or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery and new technologies.
 U.S. Drug Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic for the intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug or a BLA for a biologic;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  25

 


· | FDA audits of some clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensing of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance, and may be imposed on all products within a certain class of products. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be filed with the FDA as an IND amendment, and to the IRBs for approval. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

· | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population. These clinical trials are intended to evaluate the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We refer to our Phase 1 programs as dose-escalation and dose-expansion trials.   In addition, we refer to some of our Phase 2 programs as pivotal or registrational programs, where the results can be used to support regulatory approval without the need to conduct a Phase 3 trial.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans 

 
  26

 
exposed to the product drug. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fee. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, and a BLA to determine whether the biologic is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use. The FDA also evaluates whether the product’s manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA or BLA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety 

 
  27

 
of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. 
 Regulation of Combination Products in the United States 
 Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. We are developing combination products using our own drug candidates and third-party drugs.   Expedited Programs 
 Fast Track Designation
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs, including biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays the applicable user fee. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Accelerated Approval
 Under FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a biologic, for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.  Breakthrough Designation
 Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug or biologic product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening 

 
  28

 
disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a product be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. 
 Priority Review
 The FDA may grant an NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. 
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval or revoke a biologics license if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. We may undertake or be required to undertake a product recall.

 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity or patent periods. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The PHSA includes an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an 

 
  30

 
application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs, including biologics, intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. 
 After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee. 
 During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. “Same drug” means a drug that contains the same active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or the same principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.  Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs 

 
  31

 
required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective or medically-necessary compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. 
 The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
· | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates who perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  32

 


· | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states. 

PRC Regulation 
 In the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations relevant to our business and operations. 
 PRC Drug Regulation
 Introduction
 China heavily regulates the development, approval, manufacturing and distribution of drugs, including biologics.  The specific regulatory requirements applicable depend on whether the drug is made and finished in China, which is referred to as a domestically manufactured drug, or made abroad and imported into China in finished form, which is referred to as an imported drug, as well as the approval or “registration” category of the drug.  For both imported and domestically manufactured drugs, China typically requires regulatory approval for a clinical trial, or CTA, prior to submitting an application for marketing approval. For a domestically manufactured drug, there is also a requirement for a drug manufacturing license for a facility in China.  
 Timelines for approval in China historically have been long with the overall path to market taking as long as seven to ten years.  The CFDA, which is the chief drug regulator, historically has not had the resources to timely approve the thousands of new, generic, and supplemental drug applications it receives every year and significant application backlog of over 22,000 applications developed. Over the past several years, however, the CFDA has increased its resources and implemented various programs to reduce the time to market for drugs that meet a certain level of innovation or manufacturing and/or address certain unmet medical needs. The CFDA has been able to reduce the backlog of applications to an estimated 6,000 applications.
 In 2017, the drug regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform.  The State Council and the China Communist Party jointly issued a mandatory plan to further the reform of the review and approval system and encourage the innovation of drugs and medical devices, or the Innovation Opinion.  The expedited programs and other 

 
  33

 
advantages under this and other recent reforms encourage drug manufacturers to seek market approval in China first, manufacture domestically, and develop drugs in high priority disease areas, such as oncology.
 To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the CFDA is currently revising the fundamental law, regulations, and rules regulating pharmaceutical products and the industry, which includes the framework law known as the PRC Drug Administration Law, or DAL.  The DAL is also generally implemented by a set of regulations issued by the State Council referred to as the DAL Implementing Regulation. The CFDA has its owns set of regulations implementing the DAL; the primary one governing clinical trial applications, marketing approval, and license renewal and amendment is known as the Drug Registration Regulation. However, as of January 2018 the implementing regulations for many of the reforms in the Innovation Opinion had not been announced, and therefore, the details in the implementation of the regulatory changes remained uncertain in some respects.
 Regulatory Authorities
 In the PRC, the CFDA is the primary regulator for pharmaceutical products and businesses.  It regulates almost all of the key stages of the life-cycle of pharmaceutical products, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, marketing approvals, manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and pharmacovigilance (i.e., post-marketing safety reporting obligations).  The Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, which is under the CFDA, conducts the technical evaluation of each drug and biologic application for safety and effectiveness.  Since 2015, the CFDA has more than doubled the staff of reviewers at the CDE to increase efficiency, and delegated authority to the CDE to issue final approvals of CTAs, supplemental applications to existing drug registrations, and renewals of licenses of imported drugs.  Before, final approval was the CFDA’s responsibility.
 The CFDA’s local counterparts (particularly the provincial-level FDAs, or PFDAs) are responsible for issuing and renewing relevant licenses for drug manufacturing and distribution businesses, conducting inspections of manufacturing and distribution businesses, and other post-marketing matters within their administrative regions (e.g., recall of pharmaceutical products).  
 The National Health and Family Planning Commission, or NHFPC, formerly known as the Ministry of Health or MOH, is China’s chief healthcare regulator.  It is primarily responsible for overseeing the operation of medical institutions, which also serve as clinical trial sites, and regulating the licensure of hospitals and other medical personnel.  NHFPC plays a significant role in drug reimbursement.  Furthermore, the NHFPC and its local counterparts at or below the provincial-level of local government also oversee and organize public medical institutions’ centralized bidding and procurement process for pharmaceutical products.  This is the chief way that public hospitals and their internal pharmacies acquire drugs.
 Pre-Clinical and Clinical Development 
 The CFDA requires both pre-clinical and clinical data to support registration applications for imported and domestic drugs.  Pre-clinical work, including pharmacology and toxicology studies, must meet good laboratory practices, or GLP, issued in July 2017.  The CFDA accredits GLP labs and requires that nonclinical studies on chemical drug substances and preparations and biologics that are not yet marketed in China be conducted there.  There are no approvals required from the CFDA to conduct pre-clinical studies.
 Registration Categories
 Prior to engaging with the CFDA on research and development and approval, an applicant will need to determine the registration category for its drug candidate (which will ultimately need to be confirmed with the CFDA), which will determine the requirements for its clinical trial and marketing application.  There are five categories for small molecule drugs:  Category 1 (“innovative drugs”) refers to drugs that have a new chemical entity that has not been marketed anywhere in the world, Category 2 (“improved new drugs”) refers to drugs with a new indication, dosage form, route of administration, combination, or certain formulation changes not approved in the world, Categories 3 and 4 are for generics that reference an innovator drug (or certain well-known generic drugs) marketed either abroad or in China, 

 
  34

 
respectively, and Category 5 refers to originator or generic drugs that have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in China (i.e., many imported drugs).  
 Therapeutic biologics follow a similar categorization, with Category 1 being new to the world, but with fifteen product-specific categories.  Like with small molecule drugs, Category 1 for biologics is also for innovative biologics that have not been approved inside or outside of China.  A clear regulatory pathway for biosimilars does not yet exist, but the CFDA may soon develop one in its revision of implementing rules pursuant to the Innovation Opinion. Each of zanubrutinib, tislelizumab, pamiparib and lifirafenib have obtained approval for special examination and approval from the CDE and have been admitted to Category 1, which is a favored category for CTA and marketing approval.
 Expedited Programs
 Priority Evaluation and Approval Programs to Encourage Innovation
 The CFDA has adopted several expedited review and approval mechanisms since 2009 and created additional expedited programs in recent years that are intended to encourage innovation.  Applications for these expedited programs can be submitted after the CTA is admitted for review by the CDE.  Some of the current categories of drugs eligible for priority status that may be particularly relevant for us include:  (1) Category 1 innovative drugs that have not been approved inside or outside of China; (2) oncology drugs; (3) drugs using advanced technology, innovative treatment methods, and having clear therapeutic benefit; and (4) new drugs for which clinical trials are already approved in the United States or European Union, or for which marketing authorization applications have been filed simultaneously in China and in the United States or European Union and are manufactured in China using the same production line that passed FDA or EMA inspection. 
     If admitted to one of these expedited programs, an applicant will be entitled to more frequent and timely communication with reviewers at the CDE, expedited review and approval, and more agency resources throughout the approval process.  Each of our drug candidates zanubrutinib, tislelizumab, pamiparib and lifirafenib qualifies as domestic Category 1. 
     Conditional Approval
     Under the Innovation Opinion, the CFDA may also grant “conditional approval” for innovative drugs that treat serious life-threatening diseases for which there are no effective therapies.  Under the most recent proposed implementing rules, and recent practice, the applicants would discuss the conditional approval with CDE at a formal consultation meeting on the pivotal study design or a pre-NDA meeting.  An application for conditional approval would also be submitted at the time of the marketing application.  Drugs approved under this program may have to complete a confirmatory study within a certain period of time in order to confirm the product’s efficacy and safety profile and continue marketing.  There is no clear timeline for finalizing the implementation regulations for the conditional approval program.
     CDE Guideline on PD-1/L1 NDA
 In addition to the programs and proposals above, the CDE has recently stated that it will permit applicants for PD-1/L1 agents to submit data on a rolling basis based on the current high unmet medical need for PD-1/L1 agents.  In February 2018, the CDE released a new guideline on data requirements for NDA submissions of PD-1/L1 agents with single-arm trials (with ORR as the primary endpoint) on recurrent and refractory advanced cancers without standard-of-care therapies. Under the guideline, the sponsor must have a pre-NDA meeting with the CDE regarding the data and the NDA submission. The CDE will permit the following submission for these applicants: (1) an initial NDA submission with full preliminary safety data and effectiveness data, including the results of at least two independent therapeutic efficacy assessments of all patients who are currently enrolled pursuant to all of the protocol’s requirements; (2) during the CDE’s substantive technical review of the NDA, submission on a rolling basis of follow-up safety and effectiveness data from at least six months from the time of the last enrolled patient showing the duration of the response; and (3) submission of all efficacy and safety data as provided for under the protocol before final approval is granted by the CFDA. Sponsors may also apply for priority review and approval for their NDA to accelerate the progress.  If granted, 

 
  35

 
priority status will be applied to various stages of the approval process, including testing, manufacturing site inspection, technical review, and clinical site inspection.
 Clinical Trials
 Upon completion of pre-clinical studies, a sponsor typically needs to conduct clinical trials in China for registering a new drug in China.  The materials required for this application and the data requirements are determined by the registration category.  The CFDA has taken a number of steps to increase efficiency for approving CTAs, and it has also significantly increased monitoring and enforcement of GCP to ensure data integrity. Trial Approval 
 All clinical trials conducted in China must be approved and conducted at hospitals accredited by the CFDA.  For imported drugs, proof of foreign approval is required prior to the trial, unless the drug has never been approved anywhere in the world.  In addition to a standalone China trial to support development, imported drug applicants may establish a site in China that is part of an international multicenter trial, or IMCT, at the outset of the global trial.  Domestically manufactured drugs are not subject to foreign approval requirements, and in contrast to prior practice, the CFDA has recently indicated its intent to permit those drugs to conduct development via an IMCT as well.  
 In 2015, the CFDA began to issue an umbrella approval for all phases (typically three) of a new drug clinical trial, instead of issuing approval phase by phase.  For certain types of new drug candidates, clinical trial applications may be prioritized over other applications, and put in a separate expedited queue for approval.  Category 1 drugs are new drug trials which would qualify for this expedited umbrella approval status.  Other trials that are not part of these expedited lines could still wait up to a year for approval to conduct the trial.
 The Innovation Opinion introduced other new measures to further expedite the clinical development process. Specifically, it requires that applicants for new drug trials conduct a meeting with the CDE prior to submitting the CTA.  The Innovation Opinion also effectively introduces a notification system for new drug clinical trial approval.  In other words, trials can proceed if after certain fixed period of time (possibly 60 days), the applicant has not received any objections from the CDE, as opposed to the lengthier current clinical trial pre-approval process in which the applicant must wait for affirmative approval.  The Innovation Opinion also promises to expand the number of trial sites by truncating the timeline for accreditation by converting it from a pre-approval procedure into a notification procedure.  These reforms will require implementing law and regulations in order to proceed in practice. The CFDA proposed implementing legislation in 2017 but it has not yet been finalized.
 Human Genetic Resources Approval
 An additional approval is required for any foreign companies or foreign affiliates that conduct trials in China.  Prior to entering into a clinical trial agreement and beginning a trial, the parties to a clinical trial (i.e., the foreign sponsor and the Chinese clinical trial site) are required to obtain a human genetic resources, or HGR, approval to collect any biological samples that contain the genetic material of Chinese human subjects from the Ministry of Science and Technology, and any cross-border transfer of the samples or associated data requires additional approval. Furthermore, one of the key review points for the HGR review and approval process is the IP sharing arrangement between Chinese and foreign parties. The parties are required to share patent rights to inventions arising from the samples. Conducting a clinical trial in China without obtaining the relevant HGR preapproval will subject the sponsor and trial site to administrative liability, including confiscation of HGR (samples and associated data), and administrative fines.  Clinical Trial Process and Good Clinical Practices
 Typically drug clinical trials in China have three phases.  Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety for target indication(s) in patients. Phase 3 (often the pivotal study) refers to clinical trials to further verify the drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety on patients with target indication(s) and ultimately provide sufficient evidence for the review of drug registration application. The CFDA requires that the different phases of clinical trials in 

 
  36

 
China receive ethics committee approval prior to approval of the CTA and comply with GCP.  The CFDA conducts inspections to assess GCP compliance and will cancel the CTA if it finds substantial issues.  
 The CFDA may reduce requirements for trials and data, depending on the drug and the existing data.  The CFDA has granted waivers for all or part of trials, but it is now planning to take a more official position on the acceptance of foreign data to support an application.  The foreign data must meet the CFDA’s requirements, including, for drugs that have never been approved before in China, having sufficient Chinese ethnic data. The precise requirements are not yet clear.
 Unlike innovative drugs, generic small molecule drugs are required to conduct a bioequivalence trial to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to an originator drug marketed either in China or abroad or an internationally accepted generic drug.  The CFDA has released catalogues of reference products, and it released a first installment of a “marketed drug list” (China’s “Orange Book”) with information about drugs that may serve as reference products.  
 China does not have a well-developed biosimilar pathway, but the CFDA will permit marketing of biosimilars after a comparative evaluation with an innovative biologic.  Currently follow-on comparative and bioequivalence studies could be permitted prior to the expiration of the innovative patent under an exemption for drug development in China’s Patent Law.
 New Drug Application (NDA) and Approval
 Upon completion of clinical trials, a sponsor may submit clinical trial data to support marketing approval for the drug.  For imported drugs, this means issuance of an import license.  Again, the applicant must submit evidence of foreign approval, unless it is an innovative drug that has never been approved anywhere in the world.  
 Domestically manufactured drugs must similarly submit data in support of a drug approval number.  Under the current regime, upon approval of the registration application, the CFDA will first issue a new drug certificate to the applicant.  Only when the applicant is equipped with relevant manufacturing capability will the CFDA issue a Drug Manufacturing Approval Serial Number, which is effectively the marketing approval allowing the holder to market/commercialize the drug in China.  
 Domestically established research institutions (including domestic companies) can apply through an MAH pilot program if they are established in one of 10 designated provinces (including Beijing and Shanghai) in China. The MAH pilot program permits research institutions and individuals to develop and hold the marketing approvals for drugs without holding a drug manufacturing license. The MAHs may engage contract manufacturers and distributors.  
 The MAH pilot program is set to run until November 2018. The Innovation Opinion indicates that China will strive to implement the MAH system nationally as soon as possible by amending the DAL. The CFDA has proposed revisions to accomplish this purpose, but the timeline to finalize these proposals is still unclear.    
 New Drug Monitoring Period
 Currently, new varieties of domestically produced drugs approved under Categories 1 or 2 in China may be placed under a monitoring period for three to five years.  Category 1 innovative drugs will be monitored for five years.  During the monitoring period, the CFDA will not approve another CTA from another applicant for the same type of drug, except if another sponsor has an approved CTA at the time that the monitoring period is initiated it may proceed with its trial and become part of the period.  Therefore, by blocking other CTAs, the monitoring period can act as a type of market exclusivity.  Under the Innovation Opinion, it is not clear whether the monitoring period will remain in force. However, no documents have emerged to officially cancel it. Manufacturing and Distribution
 As noted above, China requires that all facilities that make drugs in China receive a drug manufacturing license with an appropriate “scope of manufacturing” from the local PFDA. This license must be renewed every five years.  A 

 
  37

 
separate certification of compliance with China’s drug Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, is also required, but this requirement may be eliminated as the Innovation Opinion is implemented. 
 Similarly, to conduct sales, importation, shipping and storage (“distribution activities”) a company must obtain a Drug Distribution License from the local PFDA, subject to renewal every five years. Like with GMPs, a separate certification of compliance with CFDA’s drug good supply practice, or GSP, is required.  These separate certifications for GMP and GSP compliance of the manufacturing and distribution facilities may be removed pursuant to the implementation of the Innovation Opinion.
 Another critical reform in 2017 limits distribution chains to prevent corruption but presents challenges for procurement.  This policy, referred to as the “Two-Invoice System,” generally requires that at most two invoices may be issued throughout the distribution chain, with one from the manufacturer to a distributor and another from the distributor to the end-user hospital. This excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly owned or controlled distributors, or for imported drugs, to their exclusive distributor, or from a distributor to its wholly owned or controlled subsidiary (or between the wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries).  However, the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in China. Compliance with the Two-Invoice System will become a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in procurement processes with public hospitals, which provide most of China’s healthcare. Manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the Two-Invoice System may lose their qualifications to participate in the bidding process. Non-compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to public hospitals in a locality.
 The Two-Invoice System was first implemented in 11 provinces that are involved in pilot comprehensive medical reforms. The objective is nationwide implementation by no later than 2018. Almost all the provinces and many cities have already adopted implementing rules for the Two-Invoice System.
 Post-Marketing Surveillance 
 The manufacturer or marketing authorization holder of marketing approval is primarily responsible for pharmacovigilance, including quality assurance, adverse reaction reporting and monitoring, and product recalls. Distributors and user entities (e.g., hospitals) are also required to report, in their respective roles, adverse reactions of the products they sell or use, and assist with the manufacturer of the product recall.  A drug that is currently under the new drug monitoring period has to report all adverse drug reactions (as opposed to just serious adverse reactions) for that period.
 The Innovation Opinion further clarifies that the MAH shall assume all legal responsibilities for the drug-related pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, production and manufacturing, marketing and distribution, adverse effect reporting, continuous studies, risk assessment and other relevant matters.
 Advertising and Promotion of Pharmaceutical Products 
 China has a strict regime for the advertising of approved medicines.  No unapproved medicines may be advertised.  The definition of an advertisement is very broad, and does not exclude scientific exchange.  It can be any media that directly or indirectly introduces the product to end users.  There is no clear line between advertising and any other type of promotion.
 Pursuant to the DAL and the Advertisement Law, prescription medicines may only be advertised to healthcare professionals in approved journals.  The individual advertisements themselves must also be approved by a local level PFDA.  In addition, advertisements are subject to strict content restrictions, which prohibit recommendations by doctors and hospitals and guarantees of effectiveness.  Advertising that includes content that is outside of the drug’s approval documentation (“off-label content”) is strictly prohibited.  False advertising can result in civil suits from end users and administrative liability, including fines   In addition to advertisements, websites that convey information about a drug must also be approved by a PFDA.  

 
  38

 

 The CFDA has also recently proposed to implement a separation between sales representatives and medical affairs representatives.  Medical affairs representatives will be in charge of academic promotion of the drugs and technical consulting with health care professionals, but they may not be involved in sales.  Lists of company medical affairs representatives may have to be registered with CFDA in the future.
 Regulatory Intellectual Property Reforms
 The Innovation Opinion also includes several intellectual property related reforms.  First, it sets forth the basic elements of a patent linkage system to protect innovators, in which a follow-on applicant will be required to specify patents that are relevant to its application and notify relevant patent holders (including, innovators) within a specified period after filing its application, permitting them to sue to protect their rights.  The system will require that the CFDA continue to review the potentially infringing follow-on application during any lawsuit by the innovator.  However, the CFDA may not approve the follow-on application pending resolution of the patent litigation in favor of the follow-on application or for a specified period of time, whichever is shorter.  This reform will require implementing regulations.  To date, the CFDA has not issued a proposal.  
 The Innovation Opinion also lays the foundation for the establishment of a system for regulatory data protection to protect innovators. Under this reform, when submitting an application for drug registration, an applicant may also submit an application for the protection of its clinical trial data. Such protection will be available to the undisclosed clinical trial data of drugs falling into the following categories: innovative drugs, innovative therapeutic biologics, drugs that treat orphan diseases, pediatric drugs, and drugs for which there has been a successful patent challenge. During the data protection period (the length has not yet been determined), marketing applications for the same type of drugs submitted by any other applicant will not be approved, unless such applicant generates the data by itself or obtains the consent the holder of the data.
 In addition, the Innovation Opinion introduces a patent term extension pilot program. The patent term extension system will provide appropriate compensation of patent life when marketing of the drug has been delayed due to delays related to clinical trials and review and approval procedures.  To date, there has been no proposal for implementing regulations related to regulatory data protection or patent term extension.
 Reimbursement, Pricing and Procurement
 While most Chinese healthcare costs were historically borne by patients themselves, in recent years the number of people covered by government and private insurance plans has significantly increased. There is state insurance covering urban employees, urban residents, and rural residents, as well as a growing private commercial insurance market. By the end of 2016, over 1.3 billion residents in China were enrolled in the national basic medical insurance program, and over 1 billion residents in China were enrolled in the critical disease insurance program. 
 Reimbursement under the national medical insurance program 
 Under the current program, participants of the national medical insurance program and their employers, if any, are required to contribute to the payment of insurance premiums on a monthly basis. Program participants are eligible for full or partial reimbursement of the cost of medicines included in the National Reimbursement Drug List, or NRDL. A pharmaceutical product listed in the NRDL must be clinically needed, safe, effective, reasonably priced, easy to use, available in sufficient quantity, and must meet the following additional requirements:

· | it is set forth in the pharmacopoeia of the PRC;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | it meets the standards promulgated by the CFDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | if imported, it is approved by the CFDA for import.
--+----------------------------------------------------

  Factors that affect the inclusion of a pharmaceutical product in the NRDL include whether the product is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in the PRC and whether it is considered to be important in 

 
  39

 
meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public. Since 2016, special consideration has been given to, among others, innovative drugs with high clinical value and drugs for serious diseases.  In addition, the PRC Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has also been negotiating with manufacturers of expensive drugs with high clinical demands and proved effectiveness for price cuts in exchange for inclusion into the NRDL. The 2017 NRDL covers 2,535 drugs in total, including 339 new additions, with an emphasis on innovative drugs and drugs that treat cancer and other serious diseases. 
 Government price controls
 In June 2015, the Chinese government abolished the 15-year-old government-led pricing system for drugs, and lifted the maximum retail price requirement for most drugs, including drugs reimbursed by government medical insurance funds, patented drugs, and some other drugs. The government regulates prices mainly by establishing a consolidated procurement mechanism, restructuring medical insurance reimbursement standards and strengthening regulation of medical and pricing practices as discussed below. 
 Centralized procurement and tenders 
 Under current regulations, public medical institutions owned by the government or owned by state-owned or controlled enterprises are required to purchase pharmaceutical products through centralized online procurement processes. There are exceptions for drugs on the National List of Essential Drugs, which must comply with their own procurement rules, and certain drugs subject to the central government’s special control such as toxic, radioactive and narcotic drugs, and traditional Chinese medicines.
 The centralized procurement process takes the form of public tenders operated by provincial or municipal-level government agencies. The centralized tender process is typically conducted once every year. The bids are assessed by a committee randomly selected from a database of experts. The committee members assess the bids based on a number of factors, including but not limited to bid price, product quality, clinical effectiveness, product safety, level of technology, qualifications and reputation of the manufacturer, after-sale services and innovation.
 Over the last decade, the government has been using various methods to ensure that drugs are offered at affordable prices. In 2009, the central government announced the campaign to implement a “zero markup” policy on essential drugs among basic healthcare institutions. In addition, the government began to allow medical institutions to collectively negotiate with manufacturers for a second price to further lower the already agreed bid price.  Further, the newly adopted Two-Invoice System is also aimed to reduce price mark-ups brought about by multi-tier distribution chains.
 Other PRC national- and provincial-level laws and regulations 
 We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases, or released by us to third parties. The privacy of human subjects in clinical trials is also protected under regulations, e.g., the case report forms must avoid disclosing names of the human subjects. 
 These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future, including restrictions on transfer of healthcare data. The Cybersecurity Law that took effect in 2017 designates healthcare as a priority area that is part of critical information infrastructure, and China’s cyberspace administration is trying to finalize a draft rule on cross-border transfer of personal information. 

PRC Regulation of Foreign Investment 
 Investment activities in China by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission. Pursuant to the latest 

 
  40

 
Catalogue effective in 2017, or the 2017 Catalogue, industries are divided into two categories: encouraged industries and the industries within the catalogue of special management measures, or the Negative List. The Negative List is further divided into two sub-categories: restricted industries and prohibited industries. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in industries outside of the Negative List. For the restricted industries within the Negative List, some are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to government approvals and certain special requirements. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Pursuant to the 2017 Catalogue, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products falls in the encouraged industries for foreign investment. 
 Under PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign invested enterprise is subject to the approval of, or the requirement for record filing with, the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the foreign invested enterprise must register with the competent administrative bureau of industry and commerce. In addition, the establishment and change of foreign-invested enterprises are subject to record-filing procedures, instead of prior approval requirements, provided that the establishment or change does not involve special entry administrative measures. 
 Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents 
 The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities or designated banks is required when RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
 Under current regulations, the capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes: directly or indirectly used for the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; directly or indirectly used for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; extending loans to non-related parties, unless permitted by the scope of business; and/or paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for the real estate enterprises.
 In 2017, new regulations were adopted which, among other things, relax the policy restriction on foreign exchange inflow to further enhance trade and investment facilitation and tighten genuineness and compliance verification of cross-border transactions and cross-border capital flows.

Our PRC subsidiaries' distributions to our offshore parent and their carrying out of cross-border foreign exchange activities are subject to the various SAFE registration requirements described above.
 Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution 
 The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the PRC Company Law, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations, and the Sino-foreign Joint Venture Law and its implementation regulations. Under these requirements, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.

 Labor Laws and Social Insurance 
 Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety to provide employees with occupational training to prevent occupational injury, and employers are required to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations. 
 In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, and housing funds.

Rest of World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the United States and the PRC, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
