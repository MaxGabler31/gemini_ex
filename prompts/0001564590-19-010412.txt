Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company passionately committed to developing and commercializing innovative antibacterial agents for multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections. On June 25, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our first commercial product ZEMDRI® (plazomicin) for adults with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae in adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. ZEMDRI is an intravenous (IV) infusion, administered once daily over a 30-minute IV. The approval of ZEMDRI was supported by data from the EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin in cUTI) clinical trial, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of plazomicin in patients with serious infections caused by gram-negative pathogens. ZEMDRI became commercially available in July 2018. In December 2018, we also filed a Formal Dispute Resolution Request with the FDA regarding a bloodstream infection (BSI) indication for plazomicin, for which the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) in June 2018. We have global commercialization rights to ZEMDRI, which has patent protection in the United States estimated until 2031 or 2032. On October 17, 2018, we announced the submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for plazomicin. ZEMDRI was funded in part by a $124.4 million contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
 We are also currently developing C-Scape, which is in early-stage clinical development, as a product candidate, an orally administered antibiotic to address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Our C-Scape program is also supported by BARDA.
 ZEMDRI (plazomicin)
 ZEMDRI is an aminoglycoside with once-daily dosing that has activity against certain Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. ZEMDRI was designed by our scientists to overcome the most common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms, the aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs). We developed ZEMDRI by chemically modifying an existing aminoglycoside, sisomicin, a natural product isolated from bacteria, to shield the regions of the molecule that are targeted by the enzymes responsible for aminoglycoside resistance. As a result of these modifications, ZEMDRI has the potential to remain active against MDR organisms where most other major drug classes, including commercially available aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin and amikacin, have limited activity. Based on this profile, we 
 3


developed ZEMDRI as an IV therapy for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae.
 We consider the following to be key attributes that support the clinical utility and ultimate commercial value of ZEMDRI:
  
• | Met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem in the Phase 3 EPIC trial in patients with cUTI and pyelonephritis for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoint, and achieved superiority for the EMA-specified primary efficacy endpoint. ZEMDRI was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the EPIC trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient administration as once daily, 30-minute IV therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of serious infections.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to improve dosing strategy compared to existing aminoglycosides and alternative therapeutic options, and individualized patient dosing using an in vitro assay.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to be used in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections due to CRE.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potent in vitro activity against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL-producers and CRE.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on these key attributes above, we believe that ZEMDRI has the potential to become a new standard of care for the treatment of multi-drug resistant recurrent cUTI infections and as an important part of the treatment algorithm for serious infections due to CRE.
 The need for new antibiotics to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is high, as these bacteria have become widespread globally in both healthcare-associated and community-onset infections and the use of carbapenems to treat infections caused by these organisms is felt to be contributing to the rise in CRE. In 2013, the CDC indicated that ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae pose a serious concern to public health threat requiring “prompt and sustained action.” These bacteria are commonly MDR, exhibiting resistance not only to extended spectrum cephalosporins but also to fluoroquinolones, and currently-marketed aminoglycosides. In many cases, the remaining treatment option is a carbapenem and use of carbapenems to treat these infections is thought to be contributing to increased carbapenem resistance. We estimate that there are over one million cases of recurrent and/or multi-drug resistant hospital treated complicated urinary tract infections in the United States today.
 The need for new antibiotics to treat CRE is particularly acute, as CRE are one of the top global threats in infectious disease. In 2013, the CDC labeled CRE as “nightmare bacteria” and indicated that CRE pose a public health threat requiring “urgent and aggressive action.” These bacteria are commonly MDR, exhibiting resistance not only to carbapenems, but also to most antibiotics commonly used to treat gram-negative infections, including cephalosporins, b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor combinations, fluoroquinolones, and currently-marketed aminoglycosides. We estimate that there were approximately 180,000 cases of CRE infections in the United States and the EU5 in 2016, of which 70,000 to 80,000 were in the United States. We believe that CRE incidence will continue to increase in the future.
 Commercial Strategy for ZEMDRI
 Given the lack of effective therapeutic options and the increasing rates of gram-negative infections such as CRE and those caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, we believe the commercial opportunity for ZEMDRI is significant. Our strategy is intended to support ZEMDRI’s differentiated profile from both approved and development-stage antibacterials. We expect ZEMDRI to be used in the recurrent and/or multi-drug resistant cUTI population, with a duration of treatment of four to seven days per the label. We estimate over one million patients suffer from these types of cUTI infections each year. Our commercialization of ZEMDRI is focused on this combined population and we are seeing the majority of our initial use in outpatient sites of care. Physicians are looking for additional treatment options for these patients as many have failed oral and/or IV antibiotics, with infections often recurring after treatment with IV carbapenems. We are using a small sales organization to promote ZEMDRI which is focused in key geographic outpatient opportunities and high-volume hospitals. In key markets 
 4


outside of the United States, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, we currently believe we can expand the value of ZEMDRI through collaborating with one or more global or regional commercialization partners who have local market expertise.
 Given ZEMDRI’s product profile, it can be used across multiple treatment settings, which is important when treating cUTI patients. Although some patients need to remain in the hospital for the treatment of comorbidities, other patients are hospitalized solely because they are receiving multiple antibiotic infusions per day. ZEMDRI allows physicians and patients to start cUTI treatment in the hospital and then transition to an outpatient or homecare setting, which benefits both hospitals and patients from a cost-saving and quality of care perspective. In addition, some patients treated with ZEMDRI are avoiding hospitalization altogether.
 In August 2018, we received the New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) designation from CMS. This designation provides up to 50% of our drug cost (approximately $2,700) in additional reimbursement to certain eligible hospitals for Medicare patients who receive ZEMDRI in the inpatient setting. In the outpatient setting, we are focused on educating office and reimbursement managers on billing and coding and building reimbursement confidence.
 Phase 3 EPIC Trial of Plazomicin for the Treatment of cUTI (Supported FDA Approval)
 In the EPIC trial, plazomicin successfully met or exceeded the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy endpoints, and achieved superiority for the primary efficacy endpoints specified by the EMA. Results for the FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population at Day 5 achieved statistical non-inferiority, and Test-of-Cure (Day ~17) achieved statistical superiority. Results for EMA-specified endpoints of microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure visit achieved statistical superiority in both the mMITT and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations.
 Plazomicin was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the EPIC trial. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to renal function were reported in 3.6% and 1.3% of patients in the plazomicin and meropenem groups, respectively. TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in a single patient in each of the plazomicin and meropenem treatment groups. Both events were considered mild and resolved completely.
 Phase 3 CARE Trial of Plazomicin (Did Not Support FDA Approval)
 The second study, our Phase 3 CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) clinical trial, was a resistant pathogen trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE. We closed enrollment in the CARE study in August 2016 with 69 patients, comprised of 39 patients enrolled in Cohort 1, comparing plazomicin to colistin-based therapy in patients with bloodstream infections or pneumonia due to CRE, and 30 patients in Cohort 2, a single arm cohort of plazomicin treatment in patients with serious infections due to CRE. In Cohort 1 of the CARE trial, a lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy.
 The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable to that of colistin in critically ill patients in the CARE trial. Study drug-related TEAEs related to renal function were reported in 16.7% and 38.1% of patients in the plazomicin and colistin groups, respectively. No TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in either group. However, due to the clinical status of patients enrolled in the trial who were frequently ventilated and unconscious, planned assessments of hearing and tinnitus were not possible for many of the patients.
 The FDA issued a CRL for the bloodstream infection (BSI) indication, supported by the CARE trial, in June 2018. In December 2018, we filed a Formal Dispute Resolution Request (FDRR) with the FDA regarding the BSI indication for plazomicin. We believe that the data submitted in the NDA for plazomicin provides substantial evidence of efficacy in treating BSI and that plazomicin should be approved for the proposed BSI indication. The FDA denied our first-round FDRR and we are evaluating our current options, including requesting a further meeting with the reviewing division or further pursuing our appeal.
 C-Scape Development Program
 5


We are developing C-Scape, an orally administered antibiotic to address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. C-Scape is a b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor combination comprised of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved b-lactamase inhibitor. The FDA awarded Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status to C-Scape for the treatment of cUTI in 2017. QIDP status provides incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and an extension by an additional five years of any existing non-patent market exclusivity the product may be awarded upon approval. Our C-Scape program is funded in part by a contract with BARDA for up to $18.0 million, of which $12.0 million is committed.
 We believe that C-Scape has the potential to rapidly address a serious unmet need for an effective oral treatment for patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Both ceftibuten and clavulanate have been previously approved by the FDA, therefore we expect C-Scape to qualify for the 505(b)(2) NDA regulatory pathway for the combination product, which would permit the application to rely in part on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for each compound alone, and FDA’s guidance for Antibacterial Therapies for Patients with Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases.
 On January 2, 2018, we announced positive Phase 1 top-line results for C-Scape. The Phase 1 top-line results demonstrated that, in healthy subjects, C-Scape was well tolerated across all doses studied, with no drug-drug interactions observed between the previously approved compounds when dosed in combination. We completed additional in vitro and in vivo experiments with an alternative formulation of the product candidate and, based on these results, believe this alternative formulation of the product candidate improves the likelihood of success for C-Scape for a subsequent Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study.
 Strategic Review
 On November 5, 2018, we announced the beginning of a review of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including but not limited to the potential sale or merger of us or our assets. The strategic review process continues alongside our continued focus on the commercialization of ZEMDRI and other corporate initiatives. We may be unable to identify strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, and even if executed, such strategic alternatives may not enhance stockholder value or our financial position.
Silicon Valley Bank Loan and Security Agreement
 In December 2018, our secured lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collateralized $25.0 million of the $50.0 million we previously borrowed under our loan and security agreement with SVB. Collateralization of this $25.0 million means that these funds are restricted and no longer available for our use until our cash on deposit at SVB exceeds the “Minimum Account Threshold” for thirty consecutive days, which is the greater of (a) $48.0 million and (b) the “Monthly Cash Burn,” which is defined as the difference of (1)(i) net loss plus (ii) unfinanced capital expenditures minus (2)(i) depreciation and amortization expenses, (ii) non-cash stock compensation expense and (iii) other non-cash expenses as approved by SVB.
Antibacterials Background
 Antibacterials, which, for small molecules, we refer to interchangeably as antibiotics, are drugs used to treat infections that are caused by bacteria. The introduction of antibiotics is recognized as one of the most transformative events in medicine. Prior to the introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s, bacterial infections were often fatal, and invasive surgery was accompanied by a high risk of infectious complications. Today, antibacterials are used routinely to treat and prevent infection.
 There are two main varieties of bacteria, based on a common laboratory staining test known as the “Gram stain.” Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single lipid membrane and a thick cell wall. Common gram-positive pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus species, and Clostridium difficile. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria are encircled by two lipid membranes, an inner membrane and an outer membrane, with a thinner cell wall in between. Gram-negative bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and the Enterobacteriaceae, a family of related organisms that includes Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella species. Drugs that act in the cytoplasm of gram-negative bacteria must cross both the inner and outer membranes, whereas drugs that just act on gram-positive bacteria only have to cross one membrane. Each membrane in gram-negative bacteria excludes 
 6


different types of chemical entities, requiring antibiotics that act in the gram-negative cytoplasm to be specifically designed to permeate both membranes. 
 Antibiotics are classified according to several criteria:
  
• | Spectrum: Antibiotics that are effective against a wide variety of bacteria, including both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, are considered to be broad-spectrum, while those that act upon only a limited number of species are considered to be narrow-spectrum. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are most often selected if a specific pathogen is suspected or confirmed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cidality: Antibiotic action generally falls into two categories: bacteriostatic and bactericidal. Bacteriostatic antibiotics halt the growth of bacteria, relying on the immune system to clear the infection. Bactericidal antibiotics kill the bacterial pathogen directly and are preferred in life-threatening infections and when the patient’s immune system is not functioning optimally.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In vitro microbiological activity: This is the ability of the antibiotic to kill or inhibit growth of bacteria in vitro. In vitro experiments and assays do not take into account the complex interactions that occur in animals or humans, but are relatively easy to perform in the laboratory and usually constitute the extent of routine microbiological testing in hospital laboratories. Potency, which relates drug concentrations to activity, is commonly expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration (“MIC”) in µg/mL, which is the lowest concentration at which the drug inhibits growth of the bacteria. Antibiotics with lower MICs are considered to be more potent.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Susceptibility/non-susceptibility: The relationship between microbiological activity and the clinical utility of an antibiotic to treat a given infection can be described in terms of susceptibility or non-susceptibility. A susceptible MIC value indicates a high probability that an antibiotic can be used to treat a particular infection. A non-susceptible MIC value from in vitro testing suggests the antibiotic is unlikely to be effective against the causative pathogen and thus should only be used under supervision of an infectious disease specialist. An intermediate MIC value suggests there is a slight chance the antibiotic will be effective against the causative pathogen. The MIC values defining susceptibility are established by FDA on approval of new antibiotics and medical standards organizations including the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (“CLSI”), and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (“EUCAST”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antimicrobial resistance: Resistance generally indicates the inability of an antibiotic to effectively treat an infection at usually administered doses. Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics. Resistance can also occur due to genetic mutations or acquisition of exogenous genetic material (e.g., plasmids). Mechanisms responsible for resistance to different antibiotics commonly travel together on mobile elements like plasmids which can transfer and spread between different bacteria, leading to multi-drug resistance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Antibiotics Are Needed for Resistant Gram-negative Infections
 Antibiotic-resistant infections not only cause significant morbidity and mortality, but also place a substantial cost burden on the healthcare system. In most cases, antibiotic-resistant infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extend hospital stays, and necessitate additional doctor visits and healthcare expenditures compared with infections that are easily treatable with antibiotics. The CDC estimates that the excess annual cost resulting from these infections in the United States is as high as $20 billion. According to an estimate from a 2012 study of over 5,500 U.S. patients, the average incremental per-patient hospital cost for antibiotic-resistant healthcare-associated infections, as compared to antibiotic-susceptible infections, was over $15,000.
 According to government agencies and physician groups such as the CDC and the Infectious Disease Society of America, one of the greatest needs is for new antibiotics to treat infections caused by drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, including ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, CRE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. These pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, as growing antibiotic resistance has left limited effective treatment options.

Governments, in collaboration with the private sector, have begun to respond to this significant and growing unmet medical need by creating governmental and non-governmental entities tasked with addressing the problem and progressing legislation for reimbursement and regulatory reform, and economic incentives. In the United States, the federal government has developed a National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, which outlines Federal activities over the five-year period from 2015 to 2020 designed (i) to enhance domestic and international capacity to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; (ii) to maintain the efficacy of current and new antibiotics; and (iii) to develop and deploy next-generation diagnostics, antibiotics, vaccines, and other therapeutics. The National Action Plan proposes to accelerate research and development for new antibiotics through a multifaceted approach that includes intensified support for antibiotic product development from the NIH, BARDA, and the DOD’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (“DTRA”). Accordingly, the 2019 U.S. federal budget request includes $1.27 billion for BARDA of which $192 million is to combat antimicrobial resistant bacteria (CARB), and $510 million is for Project BioShield (PBS) to support late stage development and procurement of medical countermeasures for national security threats. The federal government has also established the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria, a federal advisory committee, which is designed to provide advice, information, and recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on programs and policies related to combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
 On the legislative front, in July 2012, the Federal Drug and Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) was passed, which included the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act (the “GAIN Act”). The GAIN Act provides incentives for the development of new QIDP, including potential for priority review and the potential for adding five years to the otherwise applicable regulatory exclusivity period. In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) was passed by Congress and signed into law. This piece of legislation is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and spur innovation in biomedical research.
 Government Contracts and Non-Profit Grants
 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”)
 Our program to develop ZEMDRI for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE, as well as for disease caused by certain bacterial biothreat pathogens, was partially funded under a contract with BARDA (“BARDA-plazo Contract”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This contract was awarded in August 2010 and consists of a base amount as well as four options, all of which were exercised. The base amount and the four-exercised options totaled $124.4 million of funding, all of which has been recorded as revenues as of December 31, 2018. 
 Overall, the BARDA-plazo Contract called for the development, manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical evaluation of, and regulatory filings for, ZEMDRI as a countermeasure for diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These pathogens include bacteria associated with serious hospital-acquired infections, such as CRE, as well as biothreats, such as F. tularensis, which causes tularemia, and Y. pestis, which causes plague. As the prime contractor, we were responsible for all technical and regulatory activities under the research plan proposed by us and accepted by BARDA. 
 Our program to develop C-Scape, a product candidate to treat serious bacterial infections due to ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae, is also partially funded under a contract with BARDA. In September 2017, we were awarded the C-Scape Contract (“BARDA C-Scape Contract”) which includes a base period with obligated funding of $12.0 million and subsequent option periods that, if exercised, would bring the total value of the award to $18.0 million. Through December 31, 2018, we have recorded $5.2 million to revenue, with $6.8 million remaining available from the funding currently committed under the C-Scape Contract.
 Payments under the BARDA-plazo and BARDA C-Scape Contracts, collectively (“the BARDA contracts,”) have been made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments to us are based on direct costs incurred and allowances for overhead, plus a fee, where applicable. From time to time, we may propose a change to the research plan to BARDA, and BARDA may or may not choose to accept the change to the research plan, along with any associated additional costs, subject to the availability of funding, as well as other factors. We are also obligated under the contract to satisfy various federal reporting requirements, including technical reporting with respect to our ZEMDRI and C-Scape development activities, reporting with respect to 
 8


intellectual property and financial reporting. In addition, technical documents and regulatory filings may be reviewed by BARDA prior to their finalization and/or submission.
 Under standard government contracting terms, the government receives only limited rights for government use of certain of our pre-existing data and certain data produced with non-federal funding, to the extent such data are required for delivery to BARDA under the project. The U.S. government receives unlimited rights to use and disclose new data first produced under the project with BARDA funding. The U.S. government is entitled to a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the project, and may obtain additional rights if we do not elect to retain ownership of a subject invention or if we do not satisfy certain disclosure and patent prosecution obligations with respect to a subject invention. The government’s rights do not include the composition of matter patents related to ZEMDRI or C-Scape, as these were developed and prosecuted prior to our entry into the BARDA contracts and without government funding. The BARDA contracts do not entitle the government to any sales royalties or other post-commercialization financial rights.
 BARDA is entitled to terminate contracts for convenience at any time provided reasonable closeout costs are paid and is not obligated to provide funding beyond currently obligated amounts allotted from Congressionally appropriated funds.
 Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (“CARB-X”)
 On April 26, 2018, we entered into a subaward agreement with CARB-X to support the development of a next-generation broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic capable of overcoming clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms and potentially treating highly-resistant gram-negative pathogens such as the Enterobacteriaceae family, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The initial subaward is up to $2.4 million, with the possibility of up to $9.6 million based on the discretion of CARB-X and the achievement of certain project milestones. 
 Payments under the CARB-X agreement are made in installments as activities are conducted in accordance with the research plan. Payments to us are based on direct costs incurred and allowances for overhead, plus a fee, where applicable. Through December 31, 2018, we have recorded $1.3 million to revenue, with $1.1 million remaining available from the funding currently committed under the CARB-X agreement.
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the “Gates Foundation”)
 We entered into a research agreement with the Gates Foundation on May 4, 2017 to discover drug candidates against gram-negative bacterial pathogens intended to prevent neonatal sepsis in developing countries. Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, the Gates Foundation awarded us up to approximately $10.5 million in grant funding (“Grant Funds”) over a three-year research term, of which approximately $3.2 million was received in May 2017 (the “Advanced Funds”). As of December 31, 2018, the entire Advanced Funds has been recorded as revenue. Payments under the Grant Agreement with the Gates Foundation are based on milestone, target or reporting deliverables. Payments are based on direct program costs incurred or committed plus an indirect overhead fee. If the Gates Foundation terminates the agreement based on the term in the Grant Agreement, we are obligated to return any unused or committed Grant Funds.
 Concurrently with the Grant Agreement, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Gates Purchase Agreement”) with the Gates Foundation, pursuant to which we sold 407,331 shares of our contingently redeemable common stock (the “Shares”) on May 5, 2017 to the Gates Foundation in a private placement at a purchase price per share equal to $24.55, for gross proceeds of $10.0 million (the “Gates Investment”).
 In connection with the Grant Agreement and the Gates Investment, on May 4, 2017, we entered into a strategic relationship with the Gates Foundation (the “Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to use the proceeds from the Gates Investment and Grant Funds only to, among other things, conduct mutually agreed upon work, including the discovery of monoclonal antibody candidates targeting Acinetobacter baumannii with the goal of discovering drug candidates that can be administered to neonates at birth to protect against early and late onset neonatal sepsis in developing countries. We are responsible for all technical and research development activities under a scope of work proposed by us and accepted by the Gates Foundation. In addition, we agreed to publish or make the product and information from the program available and accessible at an affordable price to people in need 
 9


within certain developing countries, and at the request of the Gates Foundation we will grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to commercialize selected drug candidates in certain developing countries, which may only be exercised in the event of certain defaults described in a letter agreement between the Gates Foundation and us (the “Global Access Commitments”). The Global Access Commitments will continue in effect until the earlier of 25 years from the closing of the Gates Investment or 7 years following the termination of all funding provided by the Gates Foundation, provided that the Global Access Commitments will continue for any products or services developed with funding provided by the Gates Foundation which continue to be developed or available in certain developing countries.
 On December 27, 2018, we entered into a License Confirmation Agreement and a Redemption Agreement with the Gates Foundation (together, the “2018 Gates Agreements”) in connection with the amendment of certain provisions of the Grant Agreement and the Letter Agreement.  The 2018 Gates Agreements were entered into following the de-prioritization of antibody work by the Company, which was the focus of the Company’s collaboration with the Gates Foundation.  Among other things, the 2018 Gates Agreements (a) terminated the Company’s obligations to conduct mutually agreed upon work, including work related to the Company’s platform technology to develop and launch a product intended to prevent neonatal sepsis, (b) terminated the obligations of the Company to discover drug candidates intended to prevent neonatal sepsis and the obligation of the Gates Foundation to fund approximately $7.1 million in grants not yet received by the Company and (c) granted the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive license to intellectual property developed by the Company pursuant to the Grant Agreement and Letter Agreement in specified developing countries.
 The Redemption Agreement also provided for the redemption by the Company of the 407,331 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Gates Shares”) purchased by the Gates Foundation pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement between the Company and the Gates Foundation dated as of May 4, 2017 (the “Purchase Agreement”) for an aggregate redemption price of $5.7 million. The Company paid for the redemption of the Gates Shares with the unused portion of the restricted cash received by the Company pursuant to the original purchase of the Gates Shares under the Purchase Agreement.  
 For more information regarding the government contracts referred to above see “Risk Factors--Risks Related to Our U.S. Government Contracts and to Certain Grant Agreements” and “Risk Factors--Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” Provisions in our U.S. government contracts, including our contract with BARDA, and certain grant agreements, including our collaboration with the Gates Foundation, may affect our intellectual property rights. As is customary under many government-funded research grants and contracts with foundations, including our collaboration with the Gates Foundation, we may not have sole rights to certain intellectual property and, in specific situations, could share or lose the rights we do have.
 Commercial Agreements
 License Agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
 On January 25, 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ionis”), pursuant to which Ionis granted us an exclusive license under certain patents relating to aminoglycoside antibacterial compounds and related know-how to develop and commercialize certain novel aminoglycoside antibacterial compounds. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize certain compounds under the agreement. In consideration for the rights granted to us by Ionis under the license agreement, we issued $1.5 million of our Series A convertible preferred stock to Ionis in 2006. In addition, we are required to make payments to Ionis upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones totaling up to $19.5 million for the first aminoglycoside product developed under certain terms of the agreement. We paid $4.0 million to Ionis in the fourth quarter of 2014 following dosing the first patient in our Phase 3 CARE trial of ZEMDRI, $7.5 million in the third quarter of 2018 upon FDA approval of ZEMDRI, and could owe up to $9.75 million for a second aminoglycoside product, if any, developed under this agreement. The agreement requires us to pay Ionis a low double-digit share of non-royalty sublicensing revenues that we receive from certain sublicensees for the grant of sublicenses under our agreement with Ionis, provided that the maximum amount we are required to pay Ionis with respect to the sum of all development and regulatory milestones and non-royalty sublicensing revenue payment obligations for ZEMDRI, but only to the extent it qualifies as the first aminoglycoside product under the agreement, is $19.5 million. Likewise, our cumulative development and regulatory milestone payment and non-royalty sublicensing revenues payment obligations for a possible second aminoglycoside product under the 
 10


agreement with Ionis will not exceed $9.75 million. To date, we have made development milestone payments of $14.5 million to Ionis with respect to ZEMDRI, $14.0 million of which was paid in cash and $0.5 million of which was paid in the form of our Series B convertible preferred stock. We are also required to pay additional milestone payments of up to $20.0 million in the aggregate upon the first achievement of specified threshold levels of annual net sales of certain aminoglycoside products in a calendar year. The license agreement also provides that the Company shall pay royalties equal to a low single-digit percentage of annual worldwide net sales of all licensed products, including, if applicable, ZEMDRI. 
 Our license agreement with Ionis will continue for as long as we are obligated to pay royalties to them, which will be on a product-by-product basis until the later of (a) ten years from the date of first commercial sale of an aminoglycoside product covered by the agreement in the United States, Japan or Europe; and (b) the abandonment, revocation, invalidation or expiration of the last valid claim of a patent covered under the agreement which covers such product, not to exceed twenty years after the first commercial sale in the United States, Japan or Europe. Either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the other party, and Ionis may terminate the agreement if we fail to make timely payments, subject to a specified cure period. We may also terminate the agreement or the license with respect to a particular product without cause upon 60 days’ notice.
 Thermo Fisher Collaborative Development and Commercialization Agreement
 In April 2016, we entered into a collaborative development and commercialization agreement (the “Assay Agreement”) with Microgenics Corporation (“Thermo Fisher”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Under the Assay Agreement, Thermo Fisher is commercializing an in vitro assay to measure levels of plazomicin in serum and plasma to guide and monitor dosing regimens so that exposures fall within the desired range. In November 2018, Thermo Fisher received FDA clearance for its do novo submission of the Thermo Scientific QMS Plazomicin Immunoassay. The assay developed under the Assay Agreement provides TDM to certain patients receiving plazomicin. Thermo Fisher is responsible for the research, development, manufacture and sale of the assay. Depending on the commercialization strategy for the assay, we are required to pay Thermo Fisher up to an aggregate amount of approximately $7.0 million in milestone payments for the achievement of certain development, manufacturing and regulatory milestones. To date, we have incurred $4.3 million in such milestone payments, recorded as research and development expense. Intellectual property rights relating solely to the assay developed under the Assay Agreement are owned by Thermo Fisher and intellectual property rights relating solely to plazomicin are owned by us. In addition, each party retains ownership of certain background intellectual property and improvements thereto.
 Under the Assay Agreement, Thermo Fisher also has the worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture this assay during the period in which we continue to develop and commercialize plazomicin (unless the Assay Agreement is earlier terminated). Thermo Fisher also has the exclusive right to commercialize this assay under the Thermo Scientific name in each country in the territory in which we are commercializing plazomicin, for as long as we are commercializing plazomicin in such country. We are required to prioritize the promotion of the assay developed under the Assay Agreement relative to the promotion of any other assay capable of measuring plazomicin in certain countries, including the United States, Japan and Europe, so long as Thermo Fisher is capable of providing sufficient supply of the assay. The Assay Agreement further requires us to make certain annual payments to Thermo Fisher if commercialization targets are not met during certain periods following commercialization. If Thermo Fisher abandons its commercialization of the assay, Thermo Fisher is required to negotiate an agreement for the continued supply of the assay to us or our distributor.
 The term of the Assay Agreement continues until we cease development and commercialization of plazomicin. Either we or Thermo Fisher may terminate the Assay Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy (or similar event), and we may terminate without cause upon sixty days’ written notice to Thermo Fisher. If we terminate the Assay Agreement without cause or Thermo Fisher terminates the Assay Agreement for cause prior to the payment of all milestone payments, we must pay to Thermo Fisher a sum equal to the amount that would have been due if the next applicable milestone had been achieved, provided that no payment will be due if we terminate the agreement at will in connection with the failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for ZEMDRI. If, within two years following the termination of the Assay Agreement by us at will or by Thermo Fisher for cause, we decide to develop and commercialize ZEMDRI, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we and Thermo Fisher are required to use good faith efforts to negotiate an agreement for the continued development, manufacture, supply and sale of the assay by Thermo Fisher on commercially reasonable terms, but 
 11


we would have no duty to enter into any new agreement with Thermo Fisher and we would not be prohibited from negotiating or entering into an agreement with a third party for the development, manufacture, supply or sale of any assay.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is very competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, as well as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are superior to, or more effectively marketed than, ZEMDRI or any other drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive.
 The competition in the antibiotics market is intense. Our clinical development program supports ZEMDRI’s differentiated profile from both approved and development-stage antibacterials by focusing on the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae in patients with limited or no alternative treatment options, including patients with cUTI or AP. ZEMDRI will face competition from commercially available antibiotics such as Avycaz™ (
ceftazidime-avibactam)
, which is marketed in the United States by Allergan plc and marketed by Pfizer outside the United States, VabomereTM (meropenem/vaborbactam), 
which is marketed by Melinta Therapeutics, ZerbaxaTM (ceftolozane/tazobactam) 
which is marketed by Merck, meropenem marketed by Pfizer as Merrem®, ertapenem which is marketed by Merck at EnvanzTM, XeravaTM (eravacycline), which is marketed by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
other aminoglycosides that are generically available (such as 
gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin), and polymixins 
that are generically available (colistin and polymixin 
B).
 There are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development by third parties to treat MDR gram-negative infections. Merck & Co., Inc. is developing imipenem/relebactam for certain life-threatening infections caused by MDR strains, including infections due to metallo-beta-lactamase producing gram-negative pathogens. Nabriva Therapeutics plc is developing Contepo™ (intravenous fosfomycin) for cUTI. Shionogi is developing cefiderocol for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens. Allergan plc and Pfizer Inc. are developing aztreonam/avibactam for infections caused by MDR strains. Iterum is developing sulopenem for uUTI and cUTI and Spero Therapeutics is developing tebipenem for cUTI. We may also eventually face competition from products in earlier development stage. If our competitors obtain marketing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their product candidates more rapidly than us, it could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 We believe that ZEMDRI would compete effectively against both marketed and known pipeline competitors based on the following:
  
• | Potent in vitro and in vivo activity in nonclinical studies against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including CRE;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Activity in the presence of a range of resistance mechanisms, including most aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, fluoroquinolone target site mutations, extended-spectrum β-lactamases, and carbapenemases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstration of similar efficacy to levofloxacin and acceptable safety in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with cUTI infections caused primarily by non-resistant Enterobacteriaceae;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstration of non-inferiority to meropenem at day 5 and statistically favorable outcomes compared to meropenem at day 17 in patients with cUTI/AP infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, including fluoroquinolone resistant and ESBL-producing isolates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved efficacy, overall mortality and safety of ZEMDRI versus colistin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE, based on results observed in the CARE study;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | Potential to individualize patient dosing using an in vitro drug-monitoring assay to optimize efficacy and safety of ZEMDRI therapy in BSI or pneumonia;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for more convenient administration as a once-daily, 30-minute IV therapy compared to other IV antibiotics administered multiple times per day with infusion times up to two hours; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to reduce the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of such infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If we are unable to demonstrate these or other advantages of ZEMDRI over competing drugs and drug candidates or have sufficient funds or infrastructure to effectively invest in commercialization, we may not be able to successfully commercialize ZEMDRI and our results of operations may suffer. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make ZEMDRI or any other product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing antibiotics before we do.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and certain other jurisdictions for plazomicin, C-Scape, and certain other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform that may be important to the development of our business.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Patents, issued or applied for, can cover inventions ranging from research compounds and techniques to processes related to specific products to the products themselves. Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have applications or patents on platform technologies and methods of using our products (in either case, that may relate to classes of products or methods), that may confer additional patent protection but are not necessarily a protection against competition.
 Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products depends in part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover our activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 We consider that in the aggregate our patent applications, patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations. For our lead product candidate, plazomicin, we have identified in the following paragraph the patents that are owned or controlled by us having claims directed to product-specific compositions of matter. This paragraph does not identify all patents or applications that may relate to plazomicin but are not material. We also have pending patent applications or applications we continue to file that may give rise to new patents relating to plazomicin. We do not consider any of our additional patents or patent applications are material at this time and it is unclear what, if any, patent protection we will have for the ultimate products we choose to move forward through development.
 Plazomicin (ZEMDRI)
 13


The patent portfolio for plazomicin is based upon an Achaogen-owned patent family that includes patents and patent applications directed to plazomicin and structural analogs thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing plazomicin or analogs thereof, and methods of using plazomicin or analogs thereof in the treatment of bacterial infections. As of January 31, 2019, this patent family included four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent No. 8,383,596, issued February 26, 2013; U.S. Patent No. 8,822,424, issued September 2, 2014; U.S. Patent No 9,266,919, issued February 23, 2016; and, U.S. Patent No. 9,688,711, issued June 27, 2017 which we refer to herein as the ‘596, ‘424, ‘919 and ‘711 patents, respectively), and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. As of January 31, 2019, we had corresponding granted patent or patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia (with country-specific validations), Europe (with country-specific validations), Hong Kong (via Europe), India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Taiwan. In addition, as of January 31, 2019, we had corresponding patent applications pending in Brazil, Europe, and the US. We expect any U.S. and foreign patents in this patent family to expire in November 2028, excluding any available extensions or adjustments. Note, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) has determined that the ‘596 patent is entitled to 923 days of patent term adjustment.
 ZEMDRI (plazomicin) achieved U.S. regulatory approval in June 2018, therefore the term of a US patent could be extended up to the lesser of (i) up to five additional years or (ii) no more than fourteen years from plazomicin’s approval date, under the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Applications for Patent Term Extension have been filed with the USPTO for the ‘596 and ‘424 patents. Plazomicin could also qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which can be obtained during the approval process or after approval, and effectively delays the approval of a generic application until six months after the expiration of any patent or other exclusivity that would otherwise delay approval, thus providing an additional six months without generic competition. In order to qualify for pediatric exclusivity, the FDA must make a written request for pediatric studies, the application holder must agree to the request and complete the studies within the required timeframe, and the studies must be accepted by the FDA based on a determination that the studies fairly respond to the request.
 Patent term extension and supplementary protection certificates also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval. Additional intellectual property, including patent protection, may protect plazomicin in areas including but not limited to method of use, manufacturing, and platform technologies. 
 Additional Patent Positions
 Our C-Scape program was created at Achaogen and we are pursuing intellectual property relating to this program. C-Scape was granted QIDP designation by the FDA which provides incentives for the development of new antibiotics, including priority review and extension by an additional five years of any non-patent market exclusivity the product may be awarded upon approval. Currently, C-Scape is not covered by any issued patents but we are pursuing patent positions in connection with various aspects of our program.
Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. Consequently, we anticipate that trade secrets and know-how will, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with 
 14


appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of preapproval audits of selected clinical sites, clinical trial vendors and sponsor facilities to ensure that the clinical trials upon which the approval will be based have been conducted in accordance with GCP and consistent with regulations for the protection of human subject rights described in 21 C.F.R. 50; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. In 2008, we submitted our first IND to the FDA for ZEMDRI.
Clinical Trials
 15


Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. Favorable results in a trial do not necessarily predict the results of subsequent trials:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under PDUFA guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 16


The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 17


The FDA has various programs, including fast-track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the GAIN Act. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, or that the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the GAIN Act. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and 10-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation (“BTD”) for a product candidate. BTD can be granted for a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for the other expedited review and approval programs, including accelerated approval, priority review, and fast-track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Moreover, qualification for one or more of these programs does not ensure that approval will ultimately be granted.
 We received fast-track designation from the FDA for plazomicin in August 2012. We received BTD from the FDA for plazomicin in May 2017.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 
 18


After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), have imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period.  The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) and pre-empts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third party logistic providers.  These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect. 
 19


Finally, PDMA regulates the distribution of drug samples by drug manufacturers and, along with state laws, limits the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and imposes certain recordkeeping, reporting and accountability requirements on distribution of drug samples. 
 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway
 As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or new uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need, or reduce the requirements, to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug(s). The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. We plan to pursue a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for C-Scape.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a ‘‘section viii’’ statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. A 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. We believe that our product candidate ZEMDRI is a new chemical entity. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the 
 20


original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. For drug products that contain an “antibiotic” ingredient approved prior to November 21, 1997, the statute imposes certain limitations on the award of five-year non-patent exclusivity. However, we do not believe these limitations would apply to any of our investigational antibiotics.
 Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 Under the GAIN Act provisions of FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the FDA may designate a product as a “qualified infectious disease product” (“QIDP”). In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (2) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA under the new law. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application. FDA granted QIDP designation for ZEMDRI for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and catheter-related BSI on December 14, 2014. FDA also granted QIDP designation to C-Scape in January 2017.
 The benefits of QIDP designation include eligibility for priority review and fast-track designation, and an extension by an additional five years of any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension that may be awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment.
 The GAIN Act provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of QIDP based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the EU, we may submit marketing authorization applications, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized Procedure
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public 
 21


health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
 National Authorization Procedures
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EU, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Assays
 In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FDCA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket clearance, also called 510(k) clearance, and approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States, unless an exemption applies. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device are categorized as Class III, requiring a PMA.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, a pre-market notification must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA, or the device must be one that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. The 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) 
 22


clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained.
 To obtain FDA approval of a medical device, the  applicant must submit a PMA application that must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures.
 In December 2018, our development partner Microgenics Corporation (a part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) (“Thermo Fisher”) received clearance under the 510(k) pathway for an in vitro assay for plazomicin and has begun commercializing the device in the United States.
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the EU and other countries.
 On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, as well the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/746), which repeals and replaces the EU Directive on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, regulations are directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, are intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
 The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020), while the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation will only become applicable five years after publication (in May 2022).  Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws govern certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
 Federal and state government price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs. Such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements subject manufacturers to potentially significant discounts on products, increased infrastructure costs, and potentially limit the ability to offer certain marketplace discounts.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by Health Care and 
 24


Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), signed into law on March 2010, created federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers are also required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 To the extent that ZEMDRI and any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, data privacy laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 ZEMDRI is being utilized within the hospital environment and therefore, when treating patients in the inpatient setting they will be reimbursed under a prospective payment system, or a predetermined payment amount that is based on the diagnosis related groups (“DRGs”) for Medicare patients and under a bundled payment for commercially insured patients. These payment amounts differ by the type of diagnosis, procedures performed and the severity of the patient’s condition, among other things. Typically, the cost of treatment for hospital acquired infections, for which ZEMDRI would be used, is included in the DRG or bundled payment and not eligible for any separate payment. For catastrophic cases where costs greatly exceed the bundled payment amount, the hospital may be eligible for an outlier payment that is intended to cover part of the expense above the standard payment. 
 In August 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved a new technology add-on payment (NTAP) for ZEMDRI when administered to Medicare beneficiaries in the hospital inpatient setting. Commencing on October 1, 2018, and continuing for a period of two to three years, the Medicare program will provide hospitals with a payment, in addition to the standard-of-care DRG reimbursement, of up to 50% of the cost of ZEMDRI not to exceed $2,722.50 for a patient treated with ZEMDRI. Cases involving ZEMDRI that are eligible for NTAP will be identified by unique ICD–10–PCS procedure codes.
 ZEMDRI is also being utilized in the outpatient setting.  Patients treated in the outpatient setting are reimbursed using different payment methodologies based on the site of care where infusions take place.  For Medicare patients treated in hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, ZEMDRI obtained transitional pass through payment status and is billed using a HCPCS Code, C9039, effective January 1, 2019.  Similar to NTAP but applicable to the HOPD setting, transitional pass-through payment status enables hospitals to receive separate payment for the drug for a period of two to three years. Achaogen participates in the 340B program for eligible not-for-profit HOPDs and has a discounted price for ZEMDRI when provided to eligible outpatients of these facilities, which we believe helps to enable hospitals to transition these patients from acute care to the outpatient setting.  When used in a physician office infusion center, we believe centers generally use HCPCS Code, J3490, which is an unclassified drug code, for ZEMDRI for 2019.  We have applied to establish a permanent HCPCS code specific to 
 25


ZEMDRI and expect to receive a decision from CMS on that application in 2019.  Treatments provided to home infusion patients may be covered using a HCPCS code, S9500, for 24-hour antibiotic infusions and billed separately for ZEMDRI using the same J3490 code.  Medicare does not cover the home infusion of antibiotics but will cover ZEMDRI under the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.  Part D plans only cover a portion of the cost of the medication; the patient is typically responsible for a per diem charge for nursing and supplies, as well as any applicable cost-sharing amounts.  ZEMDRI is also covered by state Medicaid plans for home infusion and other outpatient settings. Achaogen has a VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) agreement through which we agree to sell ZEMDRI for the treatment of veterans in various sites of care, including acute care hospitals as well as alternative sites.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
 In addition, IVD assays or related diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to such diagnostics.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. 
 Since taking office, the current administration has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the ACA and we expect that the administration and U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. There is also a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the ACA and what similar measures or other changes might be enacted at the federal and/or state level. For example, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the law. While there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future, the specific changes, their timing and their potential impact on us are not yet apparent. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the ACA including coverage and reimbursement, the exchanges, and many core aspects of the current healthcare marketplace. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA to reduce healthcare expenditures, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress, and reductions in Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, and this will remain a prominent political issue. We anticipate continued focus, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies and reduce Medicaid and other healthcare funding.

Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates and our commercial product and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build or own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively capital-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. 
 All of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial use. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of our products.
 We currently rely on a limited number of third parties for our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product for our preclinical research, clinical trials and commercial production. For ZEMDRI, we source raw materials from various commercial suppliers, primarily located in Europe and the People’s Republic of China, including the aminoglycoside precursor sisomicin. Our drug substance has been manufactured by Hovione Limited (“Hovione”) and we have entered into a long-term agreement with Hovione for commercial production of ZEMDRI. The drug product is manufactured by Pfizer CentreOne (formerly Hospira) and we have entered into a long-term agreement with Pfizer CentreOne for commercial production of ZEMDRI.
 Plazomicin
 Process. ZEMDRI is an organic compound of low molecular weight, commonly referred to as a small molecule. ZEMDRI is also considered a semi-synthetic molecule since it is derived from a primary starting material that is a natural product, sisomicin, produced by microbial fermentation. ZEMDRI sulfate is prepared in four process stages (seven chemical steps) from sisomicin, with a final purification by ion-exchange chromatography and isolation by spray-drying of the amorphous sulfate salt from aqueous solution. We believe that our use of a synthetic process will enable us to have a cost of manufacturing for ZEMDRI that is similar to other modern small molecule antibiotics.
 Bulk Drug Substance. In March 2017, we entered into a commercial validation and manufacturing agreement (the “Commercial Manufacturing Agreement”) with Hovione, an Ireland-based company with facilities in Portugal and Ireland. Under the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, Hovione agreed to carry out our validation program to validate and scale up our technology to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient of ZEMDRI (the “Product”). The validation program was successfully completed. The Commercial Manufacturing Agreement also includes the manufacturing of commercial quantities of the Product on a commercial scale at Hovione’s facilities. The Commercial Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term of seven years after the first delivery of the Product. 
 Pursuant to the Commercial Manufacturing Agreement, once ZEMDRI is approved by the FDA, we have minimum quantity and minimum annual purchase commitments from Hovione depending on our requirements and the period of time following approval by the FDA. For the first three years following approval of ZEMDRI by the FDA, we are required to purchase at least 80% of its required quantity of Product from Hovione. Following the initial three years after FDA approval, we are required to purchase between 40% and 66% of its required quantity from Hovione, depending on the amounts required during any such fiscal year. Contingent upon FDA’s approval of ZEMDRI, we have minimum annual purchase commitments from Hovione, beginning in 2020 through 2024. Beyond the minimum purchase obligation contained in the Manufacturing Agreement, we may use other suppliers and Hovione is obligated to cooperate with us in such efforts, including by performing certain technology transfers. The Commercial Manufacturing Agreement may be early terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency of which termination fees related to the minimum annual commitments may apply. 
 Drug Product. We have employed the services of Pfizer CentreOne to produce our ZEMDRI IV drug product. In August 2015, we entered into a development and supply agreement with Hospira, which was amended in September 2015 to include the Pfizer CentreOne Group of Pfizer, whereby Pfizer CentreOne assists us in the

development and commercialization of ZEMDRI for IV administration. We purchase our requirement of such product for commercial sale in the U.S., Canada and the EU (the “Territory”) from Pfizer CentreOne. 
 C-Scape
 C-Scape is a combination of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved β-lactamase inhibitor. We purchase clavulanate and ceftibuten from two separate third-party suppliers (or contract manufacturers) who have experience working with these compounds. The clinical drug product (“DP”) for C-Scape is being supplied by a third-party contract manufacturing organization who has experience with these types of compounds.
