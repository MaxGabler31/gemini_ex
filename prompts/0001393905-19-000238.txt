Overview
 
The Company was incorporated on February 23, 2005 under the laws of the state of Nevada. Effective July 15, 2015, Mr. Terence Robinson was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of directors and is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company changed its name from ZD Ventures Corporation to Plyzer Technologies Inc. (PLYZER, the Company).
 
The Company has four subsidiaries, Plyzer Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2016, Plyzer Technologies (Canada) Inc., incorporated in the Province of Ontario, Canada on April 11, 2017, Plyzer BlockChain Technologies Inc., incorporated in Ontario, Canada on November 3, 2017 and Plyzer Technologies Spain s.l. incorporated on April 12, 2019.
 
Our principal office is located at 47 Avenue Road, Suite 200, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5R 2G3. Our telephone number is (416) 860-0211. Our fiscal year end is March 31. Our Canadian subsidiaries signed a lease on January 1, 2019 for premises at 67 Portland St., Toronto, Ontario M5V 2M9, Canada which will expire on December 30, 2019.
 
PLYZERs business strategy until March 2015 involved developing a social website, B Wished, acquired in July 2012 aimed at driving traffic for various sellers of products and services which can generate revenue through commissions from the associated sellers and advertisements, as well as other related sources for the Company. However, at the end of March 31, 2015, the Management concluded that this was not a commercially viable business and decided to expense all the costs related to this project. During the fiscal year 2016, the Company also wrote off small investments it had in a couple of emerging technology companies in Spain due to unavailability of adequate information from these entities to support any valuation of these investments.
 
On November 21, 2016, the Company signed a consulting agreement with an independent Spanish Corporation, Lupama Producciones, S.L. (Lupama). Lupamas key owner, Luis Pallares became the CEO of Plyzer Technologies (Canada) Inc. and Plyzer Corporation.

Lupama is creating an artificial intelligence driven engine for price comparison for the Company, known as Plyzer. Further details on Plyzer can be found in item 7 under Business Plan and Strategy section of this report.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, the Company employed no full-time and no-part time employees. However, Plyzer Spain s.l., incorporated in April 2019, now has 35 full time employees including 9 freelancers working full time for Plyzer Spain. Further hiring plans will depend on the continued implementation of the current business strategy and if the required funds are raised. It is likely that for now, the Company will resort to hiring consultants as and when needed rather than employ people on a full-time basis to keep its operational costs at a minimum. All the development was outsourced to Lupama and other independent consultants until incorporation of Plyzer Spain s.l. However, currently, we have most of the development and commercialization work carried out in-house.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
