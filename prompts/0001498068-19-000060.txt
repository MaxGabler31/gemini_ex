Item 1. Business. 
Overview

We are the largest dialysis services provider in the United States focused on joint venture (“JV”) partnerships with physicians. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 241 dialysis clinics in partnership with approximately 400 nephrologist partners treating more than 16,500 patients in 27 states and the District of Columbia.

We operate our dialysis clinics principally through a JV model, in which we partner primarily with local nephrologists to develop, own and operate dialysis clinics, while the providers of the majority of dialysis services in the United States operate through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Substantially all of our clinics are maintained as separate joint ventures in which generally we have the controlling interest and our nephrologist partners and other joint venture partners have a noncontrolling interest. As of December 31, 2018, we held on average 55% of the interests in our clinics, and our nephrologist partners held 45% of the interests. We believe the JV model, combined with a high‑quality operational platform, provides our nephrologist partners the independence to make clinical and operational decisions focused on patient care.

We provide high‑quality patient care and clinical outcomes to patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”). The loss of kidney function is normally irreversible. Kidney failure is typically caused by Type I and Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, polycystic kidney disease, long-term autoimmune attack on the kidney and prolonged urinary tract obstruction. ESRD is the stage of advanced kidney impairment that requires continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Dialysis is the removal of toxins, fluids and salt from the blood of patients by artificial means. Patients suffering from ESRD generally require dialysis at least three times a week for the rest of their lives, unless or until the patient receives a kidney transplant.

According to United States Renal Data System, there were approximately 509,000 ESRD dialysis patients in the U.S. in 2016. The ESRD dialysis patient population has grown at an approximate compound rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2016, the latest period for which such data is available. The growth rate is attributable to the aging of the population, increased incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, lower mortality rates for dialysis patients and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of ESRD.

Our core values create a culture of clinical autonomy and operational accountability for our nephrologist partners and staff members. We believe our approach has attracted nephrologist partners and facilitated the expansion of our platform through de novo clinics.

Since 2014, we have opened 13 or more de novo clinics each year. From 2014 to 2018, our total number of treatments grew at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10.3%, driven primarily by increases in non‑acquired treatments, which grew at a CAGR of 10.1%. During the same period, our revenues have grown at a CAGR of 10.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues, Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI and net loss attributable to us were $805.8 million, $90.0 million and $(28.8) million, respectively.

For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA‑NCI to net income (loss), see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Effectiveness of the JV Model in Delivering High Performance

We meet or exceed the core measures established by CMS to promote high‑quality services in outpatient dialysis facilities. As an example, we have demonstrated strong performance in the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (“QIP”), which changes the way CMS pays for the treatment of patients with ESRD by linking a portion of payment directly to facilities’ performance on CMS core measures. The ESRD QIP reduces future payments to dialysis facilities that do not meet or exceed certain performance standards. The maximum payment reduction CMS can apply to any facility is 2% of all Medicare payments for services performed by the facility in a given year. Since the inception of the QIP program in 2010, the impact of Medicare payment reductions on our revenues has not exceeded 0.1% of our net patient service operating revenues in any year. According to data released by CMS, 25.6% of ARA’s dialysis facilities with a QIP score received payment reductions under the ESRD QIP for measurement year 2017 (payment year 2019) as compared to 26.4% for the industry overall. Based on our performance in measurement years 2017, 2016 and 2015, our clinics have consistently performed above national averages with our QIP Total Performance Score of 68 in measurement year 2017 compared to the national average of 66, our QIP Total Performance Score of 64 in measurement year 2016 compared to the national average of 62, our QIP Total Performance Score of 70 in measurement year 2015 compared to the national average of 68.

Recognition Among Physicians and Alignment of Interests Makes ARA a Preferred Partner for Nephrologists

We believe that the ARA brand has a strong reputation among nephrologists. This reputation has been built since our inception, backed by the performance and success of our nephrologists and clinical staff. Our brand is also associated with high‑quality care as evidenced by our clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction levels and physician satisfaction scores. We generally conduct annual physician satisfaction surveys, which are administered by Press Ganey Associates, Inc. (“Press Ganey”), a third-party survey firm. According to the most recent Press Ganey survey, which was conducted in 2018, 98% of the 149 physicians who responded to the survey agreed or strongly agreed that our clinics provide high‑quality care and service (with the remaining 2% giving neutral responses). Our exclusive focus on the JV model combined with our recognition among nephrologists afford us high success rates in partnering with nephrologists interested in pursuing a JV model.

We believe nephrologists appreciate the quality of our dialysis clinics, comprehensive clinic management services and solid track record of clinical and regulatory compliance at our clinics. By owning a portion of the clinics where their patients are treated, our nephrologist partners have a shared interest in the quality, reputation and performance of the clinics.

We believe the JV model drives growth by enabling our nephrologist partners to reinvest in their practices and develop their practices by adding new nephrologists, which provides us with the opportunity to expand existing clinics or add new clinics. According to the Press Ganey survey, 99% of the responding physicians agreed or strongly agreed that they have adequate input into clinic decisions that affect their practices and 99% agreed or strongly agreed that they had confidence in ARA leadership (with the remaining 1% giving neutral responses). We believe our nephrologist partners’ satisfaction leads to positive references and new physician recommendations within the broader nephrology community, thereby enhancing our ability to partner with leading, established nephrologists. According to the Press Ganey survey, 99% of the responding physicians agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend our clinics to other physicians and medical staff as a good place to practice medicine (with the remaining 1% giving neutral responses).

Proven De Novo Clinic Model Drives Predictable Market-Leading Non-Acquired Growth

We have primarily grown through de novo clinic development. We have developed a streamlined approach to opening clinics that results in competitive return on invested capital for both our company and our nephrologist partners. As of December 31, 2018, we had a portfolio of 189 clinics developed as de novo clinics. 

Highly competitive de novo clinic economics. A typical de novo clinic is 8,000 to 9,000 square feet, has 15 to 20 dialysis stations (performing approximately 10,000 to 11,000 annual treatments on average) and requires approximately $1.9 to $2.2 million of capital for equipment purchases, leasehold improvements and initial working capital. A portion of this required capital is typically equity capital funded by us and our nephrologist partners in proportion to our respective ownership interests, and the balance of such development cost is typically funded through third‑party loans that we and our nephrologist partners guarantee on a basis proportionate to our respective ownership interests. 
Robust business development efforts to maintain momentum of signing de novo clinics. We have a long track record of achieving revenue growth in our de novo clinics. We believe our successful track record helps us attract new nephrologists and maintain an active pipeline of de novo clinics to be opened in the future. We frequently receive inquiries from nephrologists seeking to partner with us as a result of recommendations from our existing nephrologist partners or based on our brand recognition and reputation in the nephrologist community. Our senior management regularly meets with high‑quality lead 
10

nephrologists and engages them in discussions regarding the benefits of partnering with us. This affords us the opportunity to selectively partner with the most qualified and credentialed physicians. At any given time, we have an active roster of nephrologists, including existing nephrologist partners, seeking to open clinics within the next 12 to 24 months. 

We refer to clinics for which a medical director agreement, an operating agreement and a management services agreement have been signed as our “signed de novo clinics.” Signed de novo clinics typically take 12 to 24 months to develop before they begin serving patients. Since inception, our signed de novo clinics that have opened began serving patients within an average of 14 months of signing of the agreements. From the point a clinic begins serving patients, it may take approximately two to three years to achieve the stabilized revenue initially projected for that clinic. As of December 31, 2017, we had 25 signed de novo clinics, and 11 of such clinics were opened as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had 27 signed de novo clinics, which are scheduled to be opened in the future, and two signed acquisitions, which were completed subsequent to December 31, 2018. We believe our track record of opening signed clinics within a predictable timeline and ability to maintain momentum of signing de novo clinics has helped us sustain our industry‑leading growth rates in terms of percentage growth in non‑acquired treatments.

Management Team with Deep Industry Experience

Our management team has significant experience in the dialysis services industry. Our executive leadership is supported by an experienced team of divisional vice presidents and regional vice presidents who maintain a hands‑on approach and are focused on the success of each local clinic in their respective markets. This breadth and depth of experience gives our management team the knowledge and resources to effectively manage relations with nephrologist partners and other personnel, enhance operating results and promote growth.
Our Growth Strategy

We believe our focus on the JV model, our core values and the strength of our experienced management team have driven the growth in our patient population and physician relationships, and position us to execute on the following growth strategies:
Partner with High‑Quality Nephrologists with Strong Local Market Reputation and Patient Relationships

We partner with nephrologists who are well‑qualified and have strong reputations and patient relationships in the local market. We have a well‑established protocol to evaluate the quality of a potential nephrologist partner. Our success to date, together with the opportunities provided by the JV model, make us an attractive partner for nephrologists, including those nephrologists whose contractual relationships as medical directors at our competitors’ clinics have expired. Further, our nephrologist partners also generate awareness and recognition of our company within the broader nephrology community and provide recommendations of potential new nephrologist partners to us. Consequently, we can be selective in choosing our future nephrologist partners.

According to a report prepared for the American Society of Nephrology, there are more than 10,000 full‑time practicing nephrologists in the United States. We believe that many of these physicians treat their patients at clinics in which they have no ownership and may be interested in partnering with us in a JV model. As of December 31, 2018, we have partnered with approximately 400 of these nephrologists, or approximately 4% of all full‑time practicing nephrologists, giving us significant opportunity to grow as a premier JV model operator within the nephrologist community.

Grow Organically Through De Novo Clinics in New and Existing Markets and Expansion of Existing Clinics

We intend to leverage the JV model and our reputation in the nephrology community to continue to develop de novo clinics in new as well as existing markets in the United States. We believe our nephrologist relationships and strong reputation in the industry allow us to maintain an active pipeline of de novo clinics to be opened in the near future, which we expect to drive continued growth in our non‑acquired treatments and non‑acquired revenues. 

De novo clinics with new nephrologist partners. We believe our strong brand reputation and widespread recognition in the closely knit nephrologist community give us an opportunity to attract new nephrologists as our partners and staff. We believe that patients choose to have their dialysis services at one of our clinics due to their relationship with our nephrologist partners and staff, consistent high‑quality care, a comfortable patient care experience and convenience of location and available treatment times. Our de novo clinics showcase a core competence in building and operating de novo clinics that are supported by our comprehensive clinic management services. The historical growth of these clinics provides evidence of the consistency 
11

and success of our de novo clinic model. Since 2014, we have opened 56 new clinics with new nephrologist partners, representing approximately 71% of our 79 de novo clinic openings from 2014 through 2018.

Additional de novo clinics with existing nephrologist partners. The JV model provides our nephrologist partners with opportunities to grow their individual or group practices within their local markets. The growth of our partners’ practices contributes to the development of additional clinics with existing partners as new JVs in the same geographic area. New clinics sometimes begin as smaller clinics under the common supervision of an existing clinic in the same market. Over time, these new clinics may grow to the same size as the original clinic, or they may continue to operate fewer shifts or otherwise offer services to a smaller patient base. In either case, new clinics allow us to increase our market share by serving new patients who may find the new clinic location more convenient, or by freeing up capacity at the larger clinic where existing patients may have previously sought treatment. Since 2014, we have opened 23 new clinics with existing nephrologist partners in their respective local markets, representing approximately 29% of our 79 de novo clinic openings from 2014 through 2018.

Expansion of capacity in existing clinics. Depending on demand and capacity utilization, we may have space within our existing clinics to accommodate a greater number of dialysis stations or operate additional shifts in order to increase patient volume without compromising our quality standards. Such expansions offer patients more flexibility in scheduling and leverage the fixed cost infrastructure of our existing clinics, which in turn provides high incremental returns on capital invested. We intend to continue to work with our nephrologist partners to broaden our market share in existing markets by seeking opportunities to expand our treatment volume through expansion of existing clinics. From 2014 to 2018, we added 128 dialysis stations to our existing clinics, representing the equivalent of nearly seven de novo clinics, which further enhance our non‑acquired treatment growth rate profile.
Opportunistically Pursue Acquisitions

As of December 31, 2018, we operated 52 clinics that we acquired and integrated with the JV model. Because the acquisition cost for an existing dialysis clinic is typically higher than the cost to develop a de novo clinic, we have a disciplined approach to acquiring existing dialysis clinics. Our acquisition strategy is primarily driven by the quality of the nephrologist in the market. We pursue acquisitions in situations where we believe the nephrologist could be a potential partner and where there is an attractive opportunity to enter a new market or expand within an existing market.

We believe our disciplined acquisition strategy has yielded significant benefits. Since 2014, we have acquired 21 clinics, one of which was acquired in 2018 and two of which were acquired in 2019. Under the JV model, we provide comprehensive clinic management services such as helping nephrologist partners expand their practices and improving the acquired clinic’s cost structure including for laboratory testing, medical supplies, medications and services. 

We intend to continue to opportunistically pursue acquisitions of clinics with reputations for quality and service. In making these acquisitions, we intend to integrate the ownership of the acquired clinic with the JV model. In addition, from time to time, we may evaluate the acquisition of existing dialysis clinic operators that have implemented a JV model similar to ours.

Deliver on Our Core Values with Comprehensive Clinic Management Services

We intend to continue to focus on providing high‑quality patient care, clinical autonomy to physicians and extensive professional, operational and managerial support to our clinics through management services arrangements. Based on our experience in the dialysis services industry, we will continue to follow a disciplined approach to enhancing performance in key areas such as: billing and collections; payor contracting; patient registration; patient insurance education and insurance verification; clinical and regulatory support; human resources administration; and information technology services. We believe our management services reduce the burden of back‑office management responsibilities associated with the daily operations of a dialysis clinic and enable our nephrologist partners to focus on providing high‑quality patient care. As a result, we believe we consistently deliver high‑quality clinical outcomes.

Our management team adheres to several core values that foster practices that we believe set us apart from other companies in our industry. Since our inception, we have placed a strong emphasis on attracting, developing and retaining skilled staff at our clinics. We provide our clinical staff with necessary resources, equipment and administrative support to perform their duties effectively, and we closely monitor our staff’s satisfaction levels, responsibilities and workloads. We believe this emphasis promotes staff satisfaction and helps us attract and retain skilled clinical personnel. We believe our low employee turnover helps improve our operating efficiency and clinical outcomes.

Our Clinics and Services

ESRD patients require continued dialysis treatments or a kidney transplant to sustain life. Our clinics offer both in‑center and home dialysis options to meet the needs of these patients.

Our clinics primarily provide in‑center hemodialysis treatments and ancillary items and services. Hemodialysis typically lasts approximately 3.5 hours per treatment and is usually performed at least three times per week. Many of our clinics also offer services for dialysis patients who prefer and are able to receive either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in their homes. Home‑based dialysis services consist of providing equipment and supplies, training, patient monitoring, on‑call support services and follow‑up assistance. Registered nurses train patients and their families or other caregivers to perform either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis at home. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 90% of the treatments we performed were in-center and 10% were performed with home-based modalities, with peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis constituting 9% and 1%, respectively, of the treatments we performed.

We contract with third parties to provide ancillary services, such as laboratory testing and pharmacy services. We contract with a specialized laboratory to provide routine laboratory tests for dialysis and other physician‑prescribed laboratory tests for ESRD patients. These tests are performed to monitor a patient’s ESRD condition, including the adequacy of dialysis, as well as other medical conditions of the patient. We work with our laboratory partner to utilize information systems which provide information to physicians and staff members of the dialysis clinics regarding critical outcome indicators.

We equip our clinics with technologically advanced dialysis equipment and patient-friendly features. Our clinics generally contain between 15 and 20 dialysis stations, one or more nurses’ stations, a patient waiting area, examination rooms, a supply room, a water treatment space to purify water used in hemodialysis treatments, staff work areas, offices and a staff lounge. Our clinics are also typically outfitted with patient-friendly features, including heated massaging chairs, wireless internet and individual television sets.

In addition to a medical director, each clinic has a clinic manager, typically a registered nurse, who supervises the day‑to‑day operations of the center and its staff. The staff of each clinic typically consists of registered nurses, patient care technicians, a social worker, a registered dietician, facility technical manager and other administrative and support personnel.

Local nephrologists are a key factor in the success of our clinics. Caring for ESRD patients is typically the primary clinical activity of a nephrologist, although a nephrologist may have other clinical activities, including the care of kidney transplant patients and the diagnosis, treatment and management of kidney disorders other than ESRD. An ESRD patient generally seeks treatment at a clinic where his or her nephrologist has privileges to admit patients. Nephrologists with privileges at our clinics typically include our nephrologist partners, as well as other nephrologists that apply for and receive practice privileges to treat their patients at our clinics. 

Clinic Growth

The number of our clinics and patients has consistently increased since our inception. The following table sets forth the number of our clinics and patients as of the end of, as well as the number of de novo clinics and acquired clinics added during, each of the years indicated below.

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013 | 2012 | | 2011 | | 2010 | 2009 | | 2008 | | 2007 | 2006 | | 2005 | | 2004 | 2003 and Prior

Location and Capacity of Our Clinics

As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 241 dialysis clinics treating patients in 27 states and the District of Columbia, each of which is consolidated in our financial statements. The locations of these clinics as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:

State | Clinics | State | | Clinics | | State | Clinics 
Arizona | 2 | | Kentucky | | 7 | | Pennsylvania | 16 
California | 6 | | Louisiana | | 2 | | Rhode Island | 9 
Colorado | 13 | | Maryland | | 5 | | South Carolina | 11 
Connecticut | 3 | | Massachusetts | | 14 | | Texas | 26 
Delaware | 2 | | Michigan | | 5 | | Virginia | 6 
Florida | 44 | | Missouri | | 2 | | Washington, D.C. | 2 
Georgia | 20 | | New Jersey | | 5 | | West Virginia | 1 
Idaho | 1 | | New York | | 9 | | Wisconsin | 1 
Illinois | 3 | | Ohio | | 17 | | | 
Indiana | 7 | | Oklahoma | | 2 | | | 
 | | | | | | | TOTAL | 241


We have developed our clinics in a manner that we believe promotes high‑quality patient care. We select the geographic area of the clinic locations based on the identification of well‑qualified nephrologist partners with whom we are interested in developing a clinic. In cooperation with our nephrologist partners, we select specific locations to maximize convenience to the patients based on demographic and other factors. Other considerations in identifying geographic areas and specific locations include:
•the availability and cost of qualified and skilled personnel, particularly nursing and technical staff;
•the area’s demographics and population growth estimates; and
•state regulation of dialysis and healthcare services.

Some of our dialysis clinics may be operating at or near capacity. We continuously monitor our dialysis clinics as they are nearing capacity. If a clinic is approaching full capacity, we may accommodate additional patient volume through increased hours or days of operation, or, if additional space is available within an existing clinic, by adding dialysis stations, or we may open an additional clinic in that local area. Substantially all of our clinics lease their space on terms that we believe are customary in the industry. See “Item 2. Properties.” Opening of de novo clinics or expansion of existing clinics may be subject to review for state regulatory compliance, as well as those conditions relating to participation in the Medicare ESRD program. In states that require a certificate of need or clinic license, additional approvals would generally be necessary for development or expansion.

Quality Care

Our corporate management team promotes a patient- and physician- focused corporate culture, among other founding philosophies. We believe our culture and founding principles improve the clinical outcomes and operating performance of our dialysis clinics. On a monthly basis, our clinic medical directors and our clinical staff review clinical outcomes on a clinic-by-clinic basis and plan for continuous improvement. Our clinical team works routinely with individual physicians, clinic managers, and dieticians in an effort to optimize clinical outcomes such as adequacy of the dialysis treatment, vascular access, anemia management, nutrition, hospitalizations, infection control and other important indicators. Based on the review of outcomes data, action plans, including clinical programs and educational offerings, are developed and implemented. We have created a clinical ladder system that is used to track key performance data and effect improvement. We believe this system encourages our staff to strive for excellence, thereby enhancing quality of care and improving patient outcomes. 
Erythropoietin‑stimulating agents (“ESAs”) and other pharmaceuticals

Patients receiving dialysis are also typically administered one or more pharmaceuticals and supplements. Patients are commonly treated with a genetically engineered form of erythropoietin, a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the 
14

production of red blood cells. ESAs are used in connection with all forms of dialysis to treat anemia, a medical complication most ESRD patients experience. Anemia involves a shortage of oxygen‑carrying red blood cells. Because red blood cells bring oxygen to all the cells in the body, untreated anemia can cause severe fatigue, heart disorders, difficulty concentrating, reduced immune function and other problems. Anemia is common among renal patients, caused by insufficient erythropoietin, iron deficiency, repeated blood losses and other factors. Patients are also commonly treated with vitamin D analogs and iron supplements. There are a limited number of manufacturers of ESAs, and any interruption of supply or product cost increases could adversely affect our operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in the availability and cost of ESAs and other pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as our ability to care for patients” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If our suppliers are unable to meet our needs, if there are material price increases or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.”

Our Corporate Structure

American Renal Associates Holdings, Inc. conducts its business exclusively through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, American Renal Holdings Inc., and its operating subsidiaries. ARH was originally incorporated in Delaware in July 1999.  In May 2010, we were acquired by certain affiliates of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. (together with such affiliates, “Centerbridge”) and certain members of management in a series of transactions (the “Acquisition”).  ARA and its wholly owned subsidiary, American Renal Holdings Intermediate Company, LLC, the direct parent of ARH, were incorporated and formed, respectively, in Delaware in March 2010 in anticipation of the Acquisition and to provide flexibility in structuring our debt financing in the future.

The primary asset of ARH is its ownership of 100% of the membership interests in American Renal Associates LLC (“ARA OpCo”).  ARA OpCo’s primary assets are its ownership interests in our operating clinic joint ventures.  ARA OpCo is also the direct parent of American Renal Management LLC (“ARM”), the subsidiary through which we conduct our management services for our joint ventures, including revenue cycle management, compliance and other back-office operations. 
Our Operating Structure

Substantially all of our clinics are maintained as separate joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest, and our nephrologist partners, who may be single practitioners, an affiliated group of nephrologists, hospitals or multi‑practice institutions, have the noncontrolling interest. As of December 31, 2018, on average we, through ARA OpCo or another subsidiary, held 55% of the interests in our clinics, and our nephrologist partners held 45% of the interests. Such noncontrolling interests may be held directly or indirectly through entities formed by affiliated groups of nephrologists. From time to time, we may purchase additional membership interests in our JVs. Some of our joint venture partners, in particular those partners consisting of affiliated groups of nephrologists, have interests in multiple clinics with us. 

Each of our JVs is organized as a limited liability company or limited partnership (other than one JV, which is a corporation), typically in either the State of Delaware or the state in which the clinic is located. Although the terms on which each JV is owned and operated vary to some extent, our JV arrangements have many common features. Agreements that we typically enter into in connection with our clinics include joint venture operating agreements, medical director agreements and management services agreements pursuant to which we provide various support services to our clinics. See “—JV Operating Agreements,” “—Medical Directors” and “—Management Services” below.

Our relationships with physicians and other sources of recommendations for our joint ventures are required to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute, among a variety of other state and federal laws and regulations. We believe our JV arrangements satisfy many but not all of the elements of the federal anti‑kickback statute safe harbors and may not meet all of the elements of analogous state safe harbors. Arrangements that do not meet all of the elements of a safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal anti‑kickback statute but are susceptible to government scrutiny. We have endeavored to structure our JVs to satisfy as many safe harbor elements as reasonably possible. Investments in our JVs are offered on a fair market value basis and provide returns to the physician investors only in proportion to their actual investment in the venture. We believe that our agreements do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute; however, since the arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements for safe harbor protection, these arrangements could be challenged. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our arrangements and relationships with our nephrologist partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute and certain state anti‑kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.” Additional risks relating to our JV operating model and the federal and state laws and regulations under which we operate are described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

We typically enter into a JV operating agreement for our clinics with our nephrologist partners and a management services agreement with the joint venture pursuant to which we provide various support services to our clinics. See “—Management Services” below. The JV operating agreements allocate ownership, rights and responsibilities in our clinics and provide, among other things, for:

• | allocation and distribution of profits and losses;


• | procedures and conditions for the sale of membership interests;


• | voting procedures; and


• | establishment of a managing committee, in order to control the business and affairs of the clinic.


Typically, we are entitled to appoint a majority of the members of such managing committee.

Our JV operating agreements generally provide for unanimous or supermajority consent relating to certain major actions affecting the respective joint venture. Such actions typically include:

• | a sale, transfer, liquidation or reorganization of all or substantially all of the clinic, or a merger or dissolution of the clinic;


• | a lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the clinic;


• | the admission of a new or substituted member;


• | an amendment or modification of the applicable operating agreement or the constituent documents for the clinic;


• | certain transactions with affiliates; and


• | any capital calls except to the extent specifically provided in the applicable operating agreement.


Some of our JV operating agreements provide for supermajority or unanimous consent for certain other significant actions. Additionally, some of our JV operating agreements provide that if we plan to establish a new dialysis clinic in a previously agreed to restricted area, the nephrologist partners have the right to participate in the ownership and operation of such new dialysis clinic.

A substantial number of our JV operating agreements grant our nephrologist partners rights to require us to purchase their ownership interests, at the estimated fair market value as defined within the applicable JV operating agreement, at certain set times (“time-based triggers”) or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events (“event-based triggers”). Except in connection with event-based triggers and a limited number of time-based triggers, our nephrologist partners in each JV are generally required to collectively maintain a minimum percentage, most commonly at least 20%, of the total outstanding membership interests in the clinic following the exercise of their put rights. Event‑based triggers of these rights in various JV operating agreements may include the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, closure of the clinic, change of control, departure of key executives, third-party members’ death, disability, bankruptcy, retirement, or the dissolution of certain third-party members and other events. Time‑based triggers give nephrologist partners at certain of our clinics the option to require us to purchase previously agreed upon percentages of their ownership interests at certain set dates. The time when some of the time‑based put rights may be exercised was accelerated upon our initial public offering (“IPO”) in 2016 and may be further accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events, such as those noted above.
In addition, if we sell all or a portion of our interest in certain of our JVs to a third party, in certain cases our nephrologist partners have the right to participate in the sale on the same terms and conditions applicable to us or may, in some instances, require us to first offer to sell our interest in the JV to the JV members before we may sell to a third party. Most of our JV operating agreements also grant the JV or its members a right of first refusal, such that the selling member must first offer its interest to the JV and then to the other members before it may sell its interest to a third party.

A limited number of our JV operating agreements give our nephrologist partners the right to purchase all of the membership interests held by us (a “call right”), at fair market value, within a specified period before a previously agreed to termination date, generally over 20 years. If such nephrologist partners do not exercise their call right, the JV will dissolve in accordance with the provisions in the JV operating agreement unless all partners agree to continue the JV. Also, some of our JV 
16

operating agreements grant our nephrologist partners the right to purchase a portion or all of our membership interests in the JV upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, which may include sale or transfer of all or substantially all assets to a third party, merger, other change of control transactions and departure of key executives, at a purchase price typically based, in whole or in part, on the clinic valuation or the transaction valuation.

Generally, the JV operating agreements also provide the JV with the option to redeem all of the membership interests of a member if such member, including our nephrologist partners and us, materially breaches the JV operating agreement, dissolves, files for bankruptcy or provides written notice of such member’s withdrawal from the JV or upon the occurrence of such other events as provided in the applicable operating agreement. If such redemption is pursuant to the member’s withdrawal or breach of the JV operating agreement, the purchase price of such member’s membership interest is calculated based on the book value; in all other cases, the purchase price is calculated based on the fair market value.

Under our JV operating agreements, the JV’s cash flow, if sufficient, subject to the limitations described below, is typically distributed no less often than quarterly in proportion to holdings of membership interests. These distributions are made out of the JV’s net cash flows as determined in accordance with the JV operating agreement, either by a majority in interest of the JV members or by the managing committee of the JV. As we hold the majority of membership interests in nearly all of our JV clinics, we generally have the right to determine distribution amounts and are not required to obtain the consent of our nephrologist partners prior to the making of distributions from our JVs so long as a pro rata distribution is made to our partners and such distributions are consistent with the terms of the operating agreement. However, we routinely consult and work closely with our nephrologist partners to determine the distribution amount. Because distributions are limited to net cash flow available, the JV clinics are generally unable to distribute amounts that would result in the JV having insufficient capital to pay debt, interest obligations or general operating expenses or have insufficient working capital reserves.

Our JV operating agreements typically require the members of a JV to make additional capital contributions when the managing committee determines that such financing is needed and the requisite member vote, which may be a majority, supermajority or unanimous vote depending on the agreement, is obtained. As we hold the majority of membership interests in nearly all of our JV clinics and are therefore entitled to appoint a majority of the managing committee in most cases, we generally have the power to initiate capital calls, and we exercise this power from time to time. Capital contributions are made in proportion to holdings of membership interests. If a member fails to timely make a capital contribution after a capital call, the majority in interest of the members generally has the power to dilute the membership interest of that member and increase the membership interests of the other members. Where the additional capital funding is required for short-term operational cash flow needs, we may, and frequently do, extend a working capital line of credit to the JV.

Medical Directors

In order for each of our clinics to be eligible to participate in the Medicare ESRD program, a qualified physician must act as medical director for such clinic. We generally engage practicing or board‑certified nephrologists to serve as medical directors. In locations where an appropriately certified physician is not available to serve as a medical director, we seek waivers from CMS for a physician who has other qualifications to serve as our medical director. As of December 31, 2018, three of our medical directors operated under such waivers. Medical directors also typically own a noncontrolling interest in the clinic as a result of the JV model. Medical directors are responsible for, among other things:
•supervising medical aspects of a clinic’s operations;
•administering and monitoring patient care policies;
•administration of dialysis treatments, including medically necessary items and services;
•administration of staff development and training programs; and
•assessment of all patients.

Our medical directors play an important role in quality assurance activities at our clinics and in coordinating the delivery of care. Our medical directors receive compensation for their services subject to independent third‑party fair market value determinations. Our medical director arrangements are typically for an initial term of five to ten years and in most cases provide for automatic renewals at the end of the term, for periods ranging from one to five years, unless specified events occur or either we or the respective medical director provides prior written notice of intent not to renew for another term. Our medical director arrangements also include geographic restrictions that restrict our medical directors from competing with that JV within a designated area. These non‑compete provisions restrict the physicians from competing with that JV by owning or providing medical director services to other dialysis clinics but do not prohibit our medical directors from providing direct 
17

patient care services at other locations. Such agreements do not require our medical directors to recommend our dialysis clinics to their patients or directly refer their patients to our dialysis clinics.

Management Services

Our executive and senior management team operates primarily out of our Beverly, Massachusetts headquarters. Executive management located at our corporate headquarters includes our chairman and chief executive officer, chief operating officer and interim chief financial officer. Other corporate staff includes personnel responsible for the management of operations, clinical and regulatory services, corporate compliance, technical services, project management and billing and collection specialists. Our chief medical officer, divisional vice presidents and regional vice presidents are dispersed geographically throughout the United States.

Our corporate management is focused on supporting the operation of our dialysis clinics and our nephrologist partners. We enter into agreements to provide management services to our clinics. For compensation for these services, we typically receive a percentage of the clinic’s revenues. Our management agreements are typically for an initial ten‑year term and provide for automatic renewals at the end of the term, typically for another one- to five‑year term, unless specified events occur or either we or the clinic provides prior written notice of intent not to renew for another term.

Pursuant to these agreements, we provide our JV clinics with all of the managerial, accounting, financial, technological and administrative support necessary to operate our clinics, which enables our nephrologist partners to focus on delivering high‑quality patient care. We strive to improve the clinical outcomes and operating and financial performance of our dialysis clinics, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and identify opportunities that are consistent with our growth strategy. The management services we provide to our clinics generally include:

•negotiating terms for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies;
•human resources functions;
•general accounting and financial reporting functions;
•clinical and technical services;
•payor contracting;
•supervising site searches and negotiating leases;
•obtaining and maintaining licenses, permits and certifications;
•providing manuals, policies and procedures;
•performing payroll processing, personnel and benefit administration;
•billing and collection and payment of accounts receivable;
•providing staff training programs;
•recommending and purchasing of equipment;
•preparing and filing cost reports;
•preparing annual operating budgets;
•administering financial and clinical information systems;
•procuring and maintaining insurance policies; and
•performing legal and compliance services.

Competition

The dialysis services industry is highly competitive. Because of the lack of barriers to entry into the dialysis services business and the ability of nephrologists to be medical directors for their own clinics, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. According to CMS data, there were more than 7,100 dialysis clinics in the United States as of November 1, 2018. We face competition from large and medium‑sized providers for patients and for the acquisition of existing dialysis clinics. We face particularly intense competition for the identification of nephrologists, whether as attending physicians, medical directors or nephrologist partners. In many instances, our competitors have taken steps to include comprehensive non‑competition provisions within various agreements, thereby limiting the ability of physicians to serve as medical directors or potential joint venture partners for competing dialysis clinics. These non‑competition provisions often contain both time and geographic limitations during the term of the agreement and for a period of years thereafter.
18


The dialysis services industry has undergone rapid consolidation. We estimate that, as of the end of 2018, the three largest for-profit dialysis providers, Fresenius Medical Care, DaVita and US Renal Care, together accounted for approximately 80% of the dialysis patients in the United States. We estimate that the largest not‑for‑profit provider of dialysis services, Dialysis Clinic, Inc., accounted for approximately 3% of dialysis patients in the United States and that hospital‑based providers accounted for approximately 4% of dialysis patients in the United States, while independent providers and small‑ and medium‑sized dialysis organizations, including our company, collectively accounted for the remainder. Consolidation continues to increase, intensifying competition in the dialysis services industry.

In addition, in the last decade, several dialysis companies, including some of our largest competitors, have adopted a JV model of dialysis clinic ownership, resulting in increased competition in the development, acquisition and operation of JV dialysis clinics. Competition to develop clinics using a JV model could materially adversely affect our growth as well as our operating results and financial condition. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, more dialysis clinics, a significantly larger patient base and are vertically integrated and, accordingly, may be able to achieve better economies of scale by asserting leverage against their suppliers, payors and other commercial parties.

Reimbursement

We derive our revenues from providing outpatient and inpatient dialysis treatments. The sources of these revenues are principally government‑based programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Veteran Affairs. Medicare and Medicaid may be provided through certified health maintenance organization plans and commercial insurance plans. Accordingly, changes to reimbursement under these programs, as well as federal budgetary constraints, may adversely affect our revenues. As a result of the automatic budget reductions resulting from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (i.e., sequestration), since April 1, 2013, Medicare reimbursement has been subject to a 2% reduction, and this reduction has been extended through 2027. In addition, we are subject to a variety of billing and coding requirements.
Medicare Reimbursement
ESRD Prospective Payment Rate System

Prior to January 1, 2011, Medicare reimbursed outpatient dialysis centers using a composite payment rate methodology. Under that methodology, dialysis centers received a fixed per treatment rate for providing general dialysis services to a Medicare beneficiary and additional payments for ancillary services such as physician‑ordered tests and certain pharmaceuticals, such as ESAs. In July 2008, Congress enacted the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (“MIPPA”). This legislation introduced a new payment system for dialysis services that began on January 1, 2011 whereby ESRD payments are made under the ESRD Prospective Payment Rate System (“PPS”), a bundled payment rate which provides a fixed rate for the dialysis treatment itself plus a majority of the renal‑related items and services provided to a patient during the dialysis treatment, including laboratory services, pharmaceuticals, such as ESAs, and medication administration, except for calcimimetic drugs, which are subject to a Transitional Drug Add-On Payment Adjustment (“TDAPA”) for the Medicare Part B ESRD payment. This bundled payment rate is set by CMS each calendar year by (i) updating that base rate from the prior year by a market basket percentage factor (accounting for changes over time in the prices of the mix of goods and services included in dialysis) minus a productivity adjustment; and (ii) multiplying the resulting rate by a wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor.

To determine the payment rate for an adult, the bundled base rate payable by Medicare is then subject to: (i) facility‑level adjustments; (ii) patient‑level adjustments; (iii) a training add‑on (if applicable); and (iv) an outlier adjustment. The facility level adjustments include modifications for geographic variations in wage rates using an area wage index (which applies to the labor‑related share of the base rate) and an upward adjustment for facilities that furnish a low volume of dialysis treatments (i.e., fewer than 4,000 treatments per year) and apply for the adjustment. The patient level adjustments are patient‑specific “case‑mix” adjustments that accommodate variations in resources required for treatment due to patient age, body surface area, body mass index, time since onset of renal dialysis and the presence of certain co‑morbidities. Facilities that are certified to furnish training services receive a training add‑on payment for peritoneal dialysis and home dialysis training treatments that are adjusted by a geographic area wage index. If a facility treats patients who have high resource requirements in the following categories, an additional upward outlier adjustment is made to the payment rate: (i) ESRD‑related drugs and biologicals that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; (ii) ESRD‑related laboratory tests that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; (iii) ESRD‑related medical/surgical supplies that were separately billable prior to January 1, 2011; and (iv) ESRD‑related drugs that were covered under Medicare Part D prior to January 1, 2011, excluding oral‑only drugs used in the treatment of ESRD. Finally, under MIPPA, CMS has the discretion to include such other payment adjustments to the 
19

applicable base rate as CMS deems appropriate. Since the introduction of the ESRD PPS, such adjustments have varied from year to year.

A majority of dialysis patients are covered under Medicare. Dialysis patients become eligible for primary Medicare coverage at various times, depending on their age or disability status, as well as whether they are covered by an employer group health plan. Generally, for a patient not covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare becomes the primary payor after a three‑month waiting period, but this three‑month waiting period may be partially or completely waived if the patient participates in a self‑dialysis training program or has a kidney transplant. For a patient covered by an employer group health plan, Medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three‑month waiting period and a 30‑month coordination of benefits period, or earlier if the patient’s employer group health plan coverage terminates or the employer group health plan took into account the patient’s age‑based Medicare entitlement when he or she retired and is paying benefits secondary to Medicare. When Medicare becomes a patient’s primary payor, the payment rate for that patient shifts from the employer group health plan rate to the Medicare payment rate.

For each covered treatment, Medicare pays 80% of the amount set by the Medicare program. The patient is responsible for the remaining 20%. In most cases, a secondary payor, such as Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, a state Medicaid program or a commercial health plan, covers all or part of these balances. Some patients who do not qualify for Medicaid but otherwise cannot afford insurance can apply for premium payment assistance from charitable organizations. If a patient does not have secondary insurance coverage, we endeavor to collect payment from the patient using reasonable collection efforts consistent with federal and state law. However, in these cases we are generally unsuccessful in collecting from the patient the 20% portion of the bundled rate that Medicare does not pay.

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Medicare ESRD PPS payment rates for our clinics were approximately $283 and $248, per treatment, respectively. The increased rate in 2018 was primarily due to reimbursement of calcimimetic pharmaceuticals under the Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment (“TDAPA program”), which became effective January 1, 2018.

CMS issues annual updates to the ESRD PPS, which may impact the base rate as well as the various adjusters. The ESRD PPS Final Rule for 2019 was issued on November 1, 2018 (the “2019 Final Rule”) and set the rates for calendar year 2019. According to CMS estimates, the 2019 Final Rule will result in an overall increase of payments to dialysis facilities of 1.6%. The finalized 2019 ESRD base rate of $235.27 is an increase of $2.90 from the prior calendar year base rate of $232.37. The 2019 Final Rule expands the TDAPA program to certain new renal dialysis drugs and biological products beyond the calcimimetic drug class beginning in 2020. The 2019 Final Rule also outlines the coverage and payment policies for dialysis services furnished to individuals with acute kidney injury, in accordance with sections 1861(s)(2)(F) and 1834(r) of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, which requires Medicare to reimburse ESRD facilities for such services. Certain adjustment factors, including facility level and patient level adjustments, the training add-on and the outlier adjustment, could have the effect of increasing or decreasing the actual payment rate for some of our clinics at levels that are different than the overall national average update listed in the 2019 Final Rule’s impact analysis tables. Future adjustments to the ESRD PPS implemented by CMS could have a negative impact upon our Medicare program revenues. The ESRD PPS proposed rule for 2020 was released on July 29, 2019 by CMS (the “2020 Proposed Rule”). The 2020 Proposed Rule includes a base rate of $240.27, representing a $5.00 increase from the 2019 base rate of $235.27, as well as certain proposed changes to the TDAPA program including a proposal to extend the TDAPA program for calcimimetics to a third year while also reducing the basis of payment for the TDAPA program for calcimimetics in 2020 from Average Selling Price (“ASP”) plus 6% to ASP plus 0%. CMS has estimated that the 2020 Proposed Rule, including the TDAPA program changes, would result in an overall increase of payments to ESRD facilities of 1.6%. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The bundled payment system under the Medicare ESRD program may not reimburse us for all of our operating cost.” 
ESRD PPS Quality Incentive Program
The ESRD QIP affects Medicare payments based on performance of each facility on a set of quality measures. Dialysis facilities that fail to achieve the established quality standards have payments for a particular year reduced by up to 2%, based on a previous year’s performance. CMS modifies the ESRD QIP each year, such that the quality measures selected, the performance scoring system and other factors that impact a dialysis facility’s ESRD QIP performance will likely differ from year to year. CMS has established the ESRD QIP performance measures for payment years through 2021, but these measures may be subject to further change by CMS. The payment year 2019 ESRD QIP measure set contains eight clinical measures and three reporting measures, encompassing anemia management, dialysis adequacy, vascular access type, patient experience of care, infections, hospital readmissions and mineral metabolism management, as well as a new Safety Measure Domain as a third category of measures. CMS finalized the inclusion of the National Healthcare Safety Network Dialysis Event reporting 
20

measure into the ESRD QIP measure set for payment year 2019, and then combined this measure with the existing NHSN Bloodstream Infection clinical measure in a new NHSN BSI Measure Topic. Additionally, CMS finalized two substantive changes to the hypercalcemia clinical measure for payment year 2019. For the payment year 2020 ESRD QIP, CMS will use eight clinical measures and seven reporting measures, encompassing anemia management, dialysis adequacy, vascular access type, patient experience of care, infections, mineral metabolism management, safety, pain management, depression management and hospital readmissions. Also for payment year 2020, CMS added a Standardized Hospitalization Ratio clinical measure and adopted a new Ultrafiltration Rate reporting measure. The payment year 2021 ESRD QIP measures replace the two existing vascular access type measures with new standard fistula rate and long-term catheter rate clinical measures, and revises the standardized transfusion ratio clinical measure. In the 2019 Final Rule, CMS removed four measures and added a new domain structure and weights beginning with payment year 2021. The four measures being removed are healthcare personnel influenza vaccination, pain assessment and follow-up, anemia management and serum phosphorous. CMS will also restructure the ESRD QIP’s domains and measure weights to align with the Meaningful Measures Initiative, a new CMS initiative aimed at identifying the highest priority areas for quality measurement and quality improvement. This will result in ESRD QIP scores for participating facilities based on four quality domains: patient and family engagement, care coordination, clinical care and safety. The 2019 Final Rule also finalized two new measures, the percentage of prevalent patients placed on a transplant waiting list and medication reconciliation for patients receiving care at dialysis facilities, beginning with payment year 2022. The 2020 Proposed Rule included certain updates to QIP, including a change that would convert the Standardized Transfusion Ratio clinical measure to a reporting measure for measurement year 2020. 
Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative
On July 10, 2019, the U.S. President signed an Executive Order entitled “Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative,” which aims to increase awareness and prevention of kidney disease, encourage alternative treatment options such as home dialysis and increase kidney transplantation. The Executive Order also establishes a regulatory pathway to introduce new value-based payment models for ESRD, including a new End-Stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices mandatory model as well as four optional models to be developed by CMS through its Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. We are evaluating the Executive Order and the value-based payment models with a view to participating in one or more of these new optional models in the future. The impact of the Executive Order and any related regulations associated with our participation in new value-based payment models could materially adversely affect our result of operations. 
Medicaid Reimbursement

Medicaid programs are state‑administered programs partially funded by the federal government. These programs are intended to provide health coverage for patients whose income and assets fall below state‑defined levels and may be uninsured. These programs also serve as supplemental reimbursement sources for the co‑insurance payments due from Medicaid‑eligible patients with primary coverage under Medicare. Some Medicaid programs also pay for additional services, including some oral medications that are not covered by Medicare. We are an authorized Medicaid provider in all of the states in which our clinics are located.
Commercial Insurance

Before Medicare becomes the primary payor, a patient’s employer group health plan or private insurance plan, if any, is generally responsible for payment for up to the first 33 months, as discussed above. Although commercial payment rates vary, average commercial payment rates are generally higher than Medicare reimbursement rates. Commercial payment rates are either rates negotiated between us and insurers or third‑party administrators or rates based on the usual and customary fee schedule, typically at a discount. We are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors and if our negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of our commercial rate increases, our revenues and operating results would be negatively impacted. In addition, as a result of the generally lower reimbursement rates from Medicare, the recent reduction in the number of patients insured through commercial insurance plans relative to the number of patients insured through government‑based programs has had, and a continuation of that reduction could have, a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If the rates paid by commercial payors continue to decline, our operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected.” Payment methods include a single lump‑sum per treatment amount, referred to as bundled rates, and separate payments for treatments and pharmaceuticals used as part of the treatment, referred to as fee for service rates. In certain circumstances, we may bill commercial payors as a non‑contracted or out-of-network provider.
21

Government Regulation

Our dialysis operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These regulations require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, government payment programs, operation of the clinics and equipment, management of clinics, personnel qualifications, maintenance of proper records, quality assurance programs and patient care. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly, and the failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, penalties, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
Licensure and Certification

Our clinics must obtain and maintain certification from CMS to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In some states, we are also required to secure additional state licenses and permits for our clinics. Governmental authorities inspect our clinics to determine if we satisfy applicable federal and state standards and requirements, including the conditions of participation for coverage in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, prior to initial operations and subsequently on a periodic basis. On occasion, these inspections result in deficiency findings, which we address on an expedited basis to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. We do not generally experience significant difficulty in obtaining certifications or licenses or in maintaining our certification or licenses. However, we have experienced some delays in obtaining Medicare certifications from CMS. If CMS delays were to become widespread, it could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Any adverse action relating to our certifications or licenses could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are subject to CMS certification, claims processing requirements and audits, and any adverse findings in a CMS review could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
Professional Licensing Requirements

Our clinical personnel must satisfy professional licensing requirements and maintain their professional licenses in the states where they practice their professions. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject them to sanctions, including the loss of their licenses and could subject us to sanctions as well. Some state professional boards impose reciprocal discipline for violations and sanctions arising out of conduct in other states. Healthcare professionals licensed in multiple states could lose all their licenses due to conduct or sanctions in one state. Professional licensing sanctions may also result in overpayments or exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third‑party programs. We cannot employ or contract with excluded parties, and we therefore monitor the Office of Inspector General’s list of excluded parties on a monthly basis.
Federal Anti‑Kickback Statute

The federal anti‑kickback statute imposes criminal and civil sanctions on persons who knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, pay or offer remuneration in return for any of the following with respect to items or services that are paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs:
•the referral of a patient to a person for an item or service or for arranging for an item or service;
•the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for any good, facility, service or item; or
•recommending the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for any good, facility, service or item.
Court decisions have held that the anti‑kickback statute is violated whenever one of the purposes of remuneration is to induce referrals. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, commonly and jointly referred to as the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), amended the federal anti‑kickback statute to clarify that, in order to violate the anti‑kickback statute, a defendant need not have known of the existence of the federal anti‑kickback statute or had the specific intent to violate it. The ACA also amended the federal anti‑kickback statute to provide that any claims submitted for items or services that result from an arrangement that violates the federal anti‑kickback statute are false claims under the False Claims Act.

22

Violations of the federal anti‑kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation, or both. Larger fines can be imposed upon corporations under the provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the Alternate Fines Statute. Individuals and entities convicted of violating the federal anti‑kickback statute are also subject to mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. Civil penalties for violations of these laws include up to $100,000 in monetary penalties per violation, repayments of up to three times the total payments between the parties and suspension from future participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Some state anti‑kickback statutes also include criminal penalties.

Regulations issued by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) create exceptions to the federal anti‑kickback statute, known as safe harbors, for certain business transactions and arrangements. Transactions and arrangements that satisfy every element of a safe harbor are deemed not to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute. Transactions and arrangements that do not satisfy all elements of a relevant safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal anti‑kickback statute but may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.

Our medical directors refer patients to our clinics. Accordingly, our agreements with our medical directors must be in compliance with the federal anti‑kickback statute. The personal services safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute, which permits personal services furnished for fair market value, is the safe harbor most applicable to our medical director agreements. Because of the nature of our medical directors’ duties, we believe it is impossible to satisfy the safe‑harbor requirement that if the services are provided on a part‑time basis, as they are with our medical directors, the agreement must specify the schedule of intervals of service, their precise length and the exact charge for these intervals. Although we endeavor to structure our medical director agreements to comply with the personal services safe harbor, our medical director arrangements do not fully qualify for personal services safe harbor protection and may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies.

We operate substantially all of our clinics in accordance with the JV model under which we generally have a controlling interest. Our relationships with our nephrologist partners and other referral sources relating to these JVs are required to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute. Although we endeavor to structure these relationships to comply with the applicable safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute, these relationships meet many, but not all, of the elements of the safe harbors. We believe that our JV investments are offered on a fair market value basis, and our JVs provide returns to our nephrologist partners only in proportion to their actual investment in the joint venture clinic. While we believe that our JVs do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, our JVs may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies.

In addition, a number of our nephrologist partners own shares of ARA as a result of common stock offerings that we made prior to our IPO. These investments were offered at a price equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of each such offering based on independent third‑party valuations, and our common stock provides returns to our nephrologist partners only in proportion to the number of shares they own. While we believe that these offerings do not violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, they may be subject to scrutiny by enforcement agencies.

For our de novo clinics, part of the capital required to construct and operate the clinics is achieved through third‑party loans and intercompany loans. In addition, once a clinic is operating, general working capital is provided to the clinic through a third‑party loan or intercompany loan. As intercompany loans do not fall squarely within the scope of a safe harbor to the federal anti‑kickback statute, they may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our arrangements and relationships with our nephrologist partners and medical directors do not satisfy all of the elements of safe harbors to the federal anti‑kickback statute and certain state anti‑kickback laws and, as a result, may subject us to government scrutiny or civil or criminal monetary penalties or require us to restructure such arrangements.”

For many of our clinics, we lease clinic space from entities in which physicians or other referral sources hold an ownership interest, and we sublease space to referring physicians. We set rent on a fair market value basis and believe that these arrangements satisfy the elements of the space rental safe harbor. See “Note 16 - Leases” and “Note 20 - Related Party Transactions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Because we purchase and sell items and services in the operation of our clinics that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by Medicare or other federal healthcare programs and because we acquire such items and services at a discount, we must structure our purchase arrangements to comply with the federal anti‑kickback statute. We believe that our vendor contracts that contain discount or rebate provisions substantially comply with the discount safe harbor, which permits rebates and reductions in the amount a buyer is charged for an item or service based on an arm’s‑length transaction if, among other requirements, the discount is fully and accurately reported on the invoice or applicable cost report and, if a rebate, the terms are fixed and disclosed in writing to the buyer at the time of the initial purchase.

If any of our relationships with physicians or other referral sources are alleged to violate or found to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute, we may be required to terminate or restructure some or all of our relationships with, purchase some or all of the ownership interests of, or refuse referrals from these referral sources and could be subject to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties, refund requirements and exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”
On August 27, 2018, the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a Request for Information seeking input from the public on how it should address any regulatory provisions that may act as barriers to coordinated care or value-based care. The OIG specifically requested information on ways it should modify or add new safe harbors to the anti-kickback statute. The OIG could modify or add new safe harbors in ways that could impact our business.
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee‑Splitting

The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state, and many states prohibit general business corporations, as we are, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. Neither we nor the JVs directly employ physicians to practice medicine but rather establish relationships on an independent contractor basis through our medical director agreements. We have endeavored to structure our activities and operations to avoid conflict with state law restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine, and we have endeavored to structure all of our corporate and operational agreements to conform to any licensure requirements, fee‑splitting and related corporate practice of medicine prohibitions. However, other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or unlawful fee‑splitting despite the way we are structured. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If our arrangements are found to violate state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine or fee‑splitting, we may not be able to operate in those states.”

Stark Law

The Stark Law is a federal civil statute which prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship (i.e., an ownership or compensation arrangement), or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities, including ESRD providers, from referring Medicare patients (and, as interpreted, Medicaid patients) to these entities for the furnishing of designated health services (“DHS”), subject to certain limited exceptions. DHS under the Stark Law include durable medical equipment and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and clinical laboratory services. Relationships that would otherwise implicate the Stark Law may be protected by complying with certain exceptions to the Stark Law, such as the personal services, space rental, equipment rental and fair market value compensation exceptions. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order for referrals for DHS to an entity by a physician with a financial relationship with the entity to be compliant with the law.

Dialysis services are not included within the definition of DHS because they are reimbursed under the ESRD PPS bundle (a composite rate payment) and are therefore excepted from the definition of DHS. Similarly, all other services that are covered under the ESRD PPS bundle are not DHS. However, clinical laboratory services, outpatient prescription drugs and inpatient hospital services sometimes are rendered in connection with dialysis and are not reimbursed under the ESRD PPS bundle. Accordingly, depending on the relationships between physicians and the providers of these designated health services associated with dialysis, the Stark Law could apply.

The Stark Law also prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from filing a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Unlike the federal anti‑kickback statute, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a violation does not require a particular mental state (e.g., knowledge of the prohibited nature of an arrangement or an intention to induce referrals). Accordingly, the prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Sanctions for violations of the Stark Law include denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the law, refunds of amounts collected in violation of the law, a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law. Violations of the Stark Law also can form the basis for False Claims Act liability if a person acts with the requisite intent under the False Claims Act. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity that trigger the self‑referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements.
24


Several of our JVs have agreements with acute care hospitals to provide dialysis services to the hospitals’ inpatients. The Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems rules and Stark Law regulations contain an exception which allows JVs to provide such services under an agreement with the hospitals. Specifically, dialysis services furnished by a hospital that is not certified to provide ESRD services under applicable law are not considered DHS. Accordingly, the Stark Law prohibitions do not apply to these services. However, because these agreements establish a financial relationship between our clinics and these hospitals (and indirectly between our nephrologist partners and these hospitals), any referrals from our nephrologist partners to these hospitals for DHS implicate the Stark Law. Accordingly, we endeavor to structure these agreements to comply with the rental of office space, rental of equipment, personal service arrangements and/or fair market value compensation exceptions to the Stark Law.

We believe that various exceptions under the Stark Law and the definition of DHS apply to our provision of dialysis services in our clinics and under our agreements with hospitals. However, CMS could determine that the Stark Law requires us to restructure existing compensation agreements with our medical directors and to repurchase or to request the sale of ownership interests in our JVs held by referring physicians or, alternatively, to refuse to accept referrals for DHS from these physicians. If CMS were to interpret the Stark Law to apply to aspects of our operations and we were not able to achieve compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

If any of our business transactions or arrangements including those described above were found to violate the federal anti‑kickback statute or the Stark Law, we could face criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other state and federal healthcare programs. Any findings that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse impact on our earnings. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”

Fraud and Abuse Under State Law

Many states in which we operate dialysis clinics have statutes prohibiting physicians from holding financial interests in various types of medical clinics to which they refer patients. Some states also have laws similar to the federal anti‑kickback statute that may affect our ability to receive referrals from physicians with whom we have financial relationships, such as our medical directors or nephrologist partners. Some of these statutes include exemptions applicable to our medical directors and other physician relationships. Some, however, include no explicit exemption for medical director services or other services for which we contract with and compensate referring physicians or for joint ownership interests of the type held by some of our referring physicians. If these laws change or are interpreted to apply to referring physicians with whom we contract or to our nephrologist partners, we may be required to terminate or restructure some or all of our relationships with, purchase some or all of the ownership interests of, or refuse referrals from these referring physicians and could be subject to civil and administrative sanctions, refund requirements and exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Federal Laws Related to Fraud and False Statements Relating to Healthcare

Federal laws, including HIPAA and the False Claims Act, make it unlawful to make false statements or commit fraud in connection with a health benefit program, including Medicare, Medicaid and private third‑party payors. These federal laws include prohibitions on (i) making false statements in connection with compliance with Medicare conditions for coverage, (ii) making false statements or submitting false documents or otherwise concealing or covering up a material fact in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, (iii) making or attempting to make a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, (iv) knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and (v) willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. Any violation of these laws may lead to significant penalties and may have a material adverse effect upon our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to adhere to all of the complex federal, state and local government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.”

The False Claims Act

The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits presenting false claims, false statements and false requests for payment to the federal government. In part, the FCA authorizes the imposition of treble damages and civil penalties on any person who:

• | knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;


• | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement that is material to getting a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the federal government;


• | has possession, custody or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the government and knowingly delivers, or causes to be delivered, less than all of that money or property;


• | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the Government, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government; or


• | conspires to do any of the foregoing.


Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. As a result of the ACA, any claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti‑kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. The ACA also created a new obligation for healthcare providers to repay to the federal government any overpayments that they receive from the federal government within 60 days of identification. A provider may incur substantial penalties for knowingly failing to repay an overpayment to the federal government, and, under the ACA, if such overpayments are not disclosed and returned to the federal government within 60 days of identification, the overpayment becomes an obligation under the FCA. The FCA requires that providers allocate resources to identify overpayments and to train employees on the potential repercussions of filing false claims with the federal government or government contractors and to monitor employee actions to detect potential false claims.

The penalties for a violation of the FCA range from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim plus three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, including coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. Such prosecutions have resulted in substantial (multi‑million and multi‑billion dollar) settlements in addition to criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition to the provisions of the FCA, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. When overpayments are identified, we endeavor to promptly return them to the applicable payor.

State False Claims Laws

Many states have adopted their own false claims laws, which generally mirror the federal False Claims Act and are designed to prevent false claims from being submitted to state healthcare programs and commercial insurers. Violations of these laws may result in monetary penalties or other sanctions for the violator. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. However, violation of these laws and the imposition of related consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our operations.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), and the privacy and security regulations implementing the statute (collectively referred to as “HIPAA”), requires us to provide certain protections to patients and their protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA requires us to afford patients certain rights regarding their PHI and to limit uses and disclosure of their PHI existing in any form of media (electronic and hardcopy). HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities like us must use when engaging in certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with billing and the collection of payment for healthcare services. HIPAA also requires that we enter into agreements with those entities that perform services on our behalf (“business associates”) and who 
26

may have access to PHI.  We have a well‑established HIPAA compliance program, including a privacy officer, a security officer, policies and procedures, HIPAA compliance Business Advocate Agreements with vendors and workforce training. In accordance with the requirements of HIPAA, we have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards, including safeguards applicable to electronic PHI. We perform periodic risk assessments with the assistance of a third party and in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA. We believe our HIPAA compliance program sufficiently addresses HIPAA requirements.
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach with respect to the security of PHI. Certain guidance provided by HHS sets forth elective standards that provide for a “safe harbor” for rendering PHI secure such that an inappropriate use or disclosure involving such PHI would not be subject to the breach notification requirements. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the HHS, which would post the violation on its website. If there was improper use or disclosure of PHI of more than 500 individuals in the same jurisdiction, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the media. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act, resulting in tiered penalties starting at $100 per violation and increasing to $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5 million per year for the same type of violation.

In addition, HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.

Although we conduct HIPAA training for our employees and contractors, the improper use or disclosure of PHI by any of our clinics, employees or contractors could result in significant fines and reputational damage to us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection, processing, storage, access, use, security and privacy of personally identifiable, protected health or other sensitive or confidential information, our business, reputation and profitability could suffer.”

State Privacy and Medical Record Retention Laws

Many states in which we operate have state laws that protect the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, including PHI. State patient privacy and confidentiality laws generally require providers to keep confidential certain patient information, including information contained in medical records. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the stricter provisions. Violations of these laws could lead to monetary penalties against providers and sanctions against licensed individuals. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California’s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clinics and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability.

Similarly, medical record retention laws place a duty on providers to retain medical records for certain periods of time and dispose of records in a certain manner. Violations of these duties may result in sanctions from state agencies or from the Medicare program. We believe that we are in material compliance with the above laws and regulations. However, violation of any such laws and the imposition of related consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our operations.

Other Regulations

Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non‑hazardous medical waste disposal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from dialysis services, although we can be subject to liability under both federal and state laws, as well as under contracts with those who haul our wastes, with respect to our waste disposal. Occupational Safety and Health Administration laws and regulations also apply to us, including, for example, those that require employers to provide workers who are occupationally exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These requirements apply to all healthcare clinics, including 
27

dialysis clinics, and also require employers to determine which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or employ hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post‑exposure evaluation and follow‑up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls, as well as comply with various record‑keeping requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

We lease many properties and own some properties in the United States. If contamination is discovered in our buildings or in the surface or subsurface or in the groundwater beneath any of our facilities, whether leased or owned, we may be liable for the investigation or cleanup of the contamination and for damages arising out it, pursuant to applicable state and/or federal law and/or under the terms of our leases. Such liability may arise even when we do not cause or contribute to the contamination (for example, where it is caused by a prior occupant or a neighbor). We take precautions to avoid contamination in or affecting our facilities. We cannot assure you, though, that such conditions will not affect us in the future.

Corporate Compliance Programs

We have adopted and maintain an active corporate compliance program, including a corporate compliance officer, compliance hotline, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and proper billing of claims and employee training regarding such policies and procedures.

In addition, we have adopted and maintain a HIPAA compliance program, including privacy and security officers, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with HIPAA and associated state laws relating to privacy and security and employee training regarding such policies and procedures.

Insurance

We maintain professional liability and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate, based on our actual claims experience and expectations for future claims. Future claims could, however, exceed our applicable insurance coverage. Physicians practicing at our dialysis centers are required to maintain their own malpractice insurance, and our medical directors are required to maintain coverage for their individual private medical practices. Our liability policies cover our medical directors for the performance of their duties as medical directors at our outpatient dialysis centers. Coverage under certain of these policies is contingent upon the policy being in effect when a claim is made regardless of when the events that caused the claim occurred. The cost and availability of such coverage may change in the future. We also currently maintain property damage insurance and other types of insurance coverage we believe to be consistent with industry practice. In most states, we maintain private market coverage for our workers’ compensation risk. The policy limits equal the minimum statutory requirements. In certain states, we procure comparable coverage through various state funds.
Information Systems

We have invested in areas such as information systems and data analytics in an effort to become more efficient and meet the demands for improved clinical outcomes. We have selected an electronic medical record system for implementation at an increasing number of our facilities in the future. We address our information and data security needs by relying on applicable members of our staff and third parties, including auditors and third‑party service providers. We have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the security of personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive or confidential information that we collect, process, store, access or use, and we take commercially reasonable actions to ensure that our third‑party service providers are taking appropriate security measures to protect the data and information they access, use or collect on our behalf. However, there is no guarantee that we can provide adequate security with respect to such data and information.
Trademarks

We own certain trademarks and logos, including AmericanRenal, AmericanRenal Associates, The Nephrologist is the Center of Our Universe and the American Renal Associates logo. Each one of these trademarks or logos is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We consider these trademarks and the associated name recognition to be important to our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 4,932 employees, consisting of 1,672 nurses, 2,077 patient care and equipment technicians and 1,183 other employees. Our medical directors are not our employees and are paid pursuant to their contractual arrangements. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Although we do not currently directly employ personnel that are members of a union, we lease employees in New York and the District of Columbia that are members of unions. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
