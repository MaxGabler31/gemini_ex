common stock of Kyndryl to holders of the Parent’s common stock as of the close of business on the record date of October 25, 2021. The Parent retained 19.9% of the shares of the Company’s common stock. The Parent’s stockholders of record received one share of the Company’s common stock for every five shares of the Parent’s common stock.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
We participate in an industry that provides services for customers’ technology environments that power their businesses. These services span areas such as management of mission-critical systems across dedicated data centers and multiple clouds. As customers advance their digital transformations, they are looking for partners that understand their business objectives and unique digital journeys and have the skills to instrument and engineer the IT environments to enable their transformations. Our long-standing position as an informed and trusted partner, with decades-long relationships and leading capabilities, provides us with the knowledge and expertise to help existing and new customers realize their future.
The market for these services is large and dynamic. We estimate that these markets, which are a subset of the total IT services market, collectively represent a $415 billion opportunity in 2021, which we expect will grow on average 7% annually to $510 billion in 2024. Growth in this market is driven by services that are aligned to customers’ transformations, including public cloud managed services (expected compound annual growth of 11% from 2021 to 2024), data services (expected compound annual growth of 18% from 2021 to 2024), security services (expected compound annual growth of 12% from 2021 to 2024) intelligent automation services (expected compound annual growth of 27% from 2021 to 2024) and managed services for edge environments representing a smaller portion of the market (expected compound annual growth above 100% from 2021 to 2024).
Several trends underpin the growth of our market, including:

● | Greater demand for digital transformation services. Companies continue to digitally transform to deliver better customer experiences and compete more effectively, which drives the need for services to support modernization of IT within the enterprise. The COVID-19 global pandemic has accelerated this already pervasive trend, as organizations look to further their digital capabilities. International Data Corporation (“IDC”) estimates that approximately 65% of GDP will be digitized by 2022. While customers seek to transform, skills availability often represents a challenge, with lack of skills ranked as one of the top three impediments to transformation of the IT environment according to Technology Business Research, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ongoing migration to the cloud. Companies continue to migrate workloads to the cloud, adopting new capabilities for flexibility, workload portability and management. Public cloud is an increasingly critical component of enterprise IT strategy. These transitions are often complex, with companies frequently seeking assistance from service providers. Gartner forecasts that by 2026, 90% of large organizations will have engaged external service providers to migrate applications to the cloud, an increase from 53% in 2020. The extension of public cloud services to multiple environments in different locations has given rise to distributed cloud and migration of workload to these infrastructures that have a greater fit for purpose.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapid data growth. As economies have evolved digitally, significantly increasing data volume, management of this data has become much more complex. IDC estimates that in 2021, enterprises created, captured and replicated 45.9 zettabytes of data. The challenge for many organizations is how to collect, harness and govern this data for insights that yield business results and realize data as a differentiator. In order to leverage advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable their business use cases, enterprises need to address data privacy, compliance, security, multicloud data management and data governance across physical and virtual layers of the IT estate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing need for secure systems. As technology environments become increasingly complex and online, remote and distributed work environments persist, cybersecurity will remain of paramount importance as threats proliferate. Breaches in security can have severe, lasting financial and reputational consequences on businesses. In response, businesses continue to build out their cybersecurity efforts, using service providers to augment their capabilities. According to PwC’s 2021 CEO Survey, one-third of U.S. CEOs plan to increase investments in cybersecurity by double digits, with 47% of CEOs citing cyber threats as sources of extreme
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

concern to growth prospects. Enterprises seek service providers that can deploy the expertise and resources needed to manage their growing cybersecurity needs with an efficient and comprehensive approach. Gartner estimates approximately 80% of organizations currently have 16 or more tools from different vendors in their cybersecurity portfolio, recognize vendor consolidation as an avenue for reduced costs and better security that addresses the complexity in their IT environments and are, therefore, interested in vendor consolidation strategies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerating pace of technological advancement. As companies adopt new technologies for improved business performance and innovation, they face a challenge in complexity to integrate these new technologies with their existing IT estates. As a result, the required skills, integration burden and cost in end-to-end operational management often increases. This drives adoption of new capabilities, such as automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure that the IT environment is well designed and orchestrated to effectively realize business objectives.

from selecting service providers that have greater insight into their environments and needs, which advantages partners with long-lasting customer relationships.
Through decades of collaboration with customers, we have developed deep relationships as we supported the technology environments that advanced their business agendas. Recent examples include:
Large-scale transformation to cloud: We partnered with a large, European financial institution to help it migrate from a predominantly on-premise, classic infrastructure environment to a cloud-based infrastructure, utilizing both private and public clouds. We provided the expertise and support to navigate this digital transformation while maintaining and improving quality of service as we moved over 1,000 applications. We also deployed a new Kubernetes container-based environment and management capabilities to increase workload portability and flexibility. This work enabled the customer’s platform to run with increased digital agility and efficiency, embedding strong data security within the new cloud-based infrastructure and providing alignment to the existing infrastructure environment. The customer’s transformation has brought business benefits, from new products and services that are brought to market faster, to an increase in sales through online channels.
Modernization of the technology environment: Based on a relationship spanning almost two decades, we partnered with a large European bank to help launch a 10-year transformational program to increase operational agility and efficiency by optimizing the customer’s critical infrastructure, reducing complexity, migrating to hybrid cloud and reducing operational costs. We reduced IT infrastructure complexity by redesigning critical infrastructure architecture, including networks, storage, virtualization and data backup for improved efficiency, enabled ‘scalable’ hybrid cloud by implementing and updating existing systems to a hybrid cloud solution supported by Red Hat and transformed legacy IT services by modernizing tools and the operating model for deployment of IT services. The customer will benefit from modern IT infrastructure including cloud and mainframes that supports their core banking services and treasury functions.
Digital transformation across the enterprise: We collaborated with a large material sciences company in North America to support their mission-critical IT infrastructure globally, providing integrated management for environments that include hybrid cloud infrastructure, network, security and end-user services. As the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the operations of many companies, we worked with our customer to help move more than 40,000 employees to a remote model while maintaining critical operations in production facilities without disruption. Building on our 16-year history of collaboration, we are working to accelerate their digital transformation. We are helping our customer build foundational capabilities for their digital journey, powered by data, analytics and artificial intelligence and machine learning integrated into core business processes and connected through a flexible and secure network. This will support our customer’s ability to fully exploit digital technologies and realize business benefit. 
Digitization for flexibility: Our customer, a large Japanese transportation company, was engaged in a technology-driven transformation to establish a flexible IT environment using hybrid cloud that evolves with changing business needs. We worked with the customer to build an integrated private and public cloud with the same virtualization architecture and a management capability that unifies operations and evolves with the business. Through our collaboration, we created an integrated infrastructure to meet our customer’s current and future needs by modernizing its on-premise, off-premise and network environments as well as its management platform. We deployed software-defined networks across the environment and automation to realize improved quality and business continuity. Our work helps support our customer’s efforts to become one of the most valued and preferred transportation companies in the world.
An important part of our services involve supporting our customers during times of crisis, including global disruptions. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our business continuity plans mitigated all COVID-driven outages in the height of the pandemic, providing peace-of-mind to our customers and giving them the confidence to focus on their core businesses. We ensured that our customers had the data and IT services needed to migrate operations to a work-from-home environment. Our response also demonstrated the resilience of our delivery model, as most of our professionals moved to work-from-home without impact to customer service.

We deliver unique value by providing intellectual property derived from insights at scale, deploying mission-critical expertise and leveraging a broad ecosystem – while building and strengthening partnerships to enhance the customer experience.
We position ourselves uniquely, leveraging a core strength in governance and management of complex IT infrastructure environments, delivered through a global footprint. Our services support customers’ digital transformations, as we help accelerate their journeys by providing instrumented and engineered technology environments. We offer choice with consistency through an operating paradigm and management model built from our experiences with complex technologies.

Intellectual Property
We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas and technologies and see innovation as a source of competitive advantage. We have approximately 3,000 patents that are related to our business model. A key pillar of our strategy is continuing to invest in knowledge and intellectual property to support extending our services to a broader ecosystem of technology providers and customer challenges and solutions. Our decades of experiences working with our customers has generated operational insights, creating intellectual property that we leverage for the benefit of our customers and deploy at scale. We rely on intellectual property protections in the countries in which we operate, along with contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our offerings and services and other applicable rights. In addition, we license third-party software along with other technologies that are used in the provision of or incorporated into some elements of our services. We possess a significant intellectual property portfolio, which we believe is important to our success. However, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular intellectual property right or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses.
Additionally, we own or have rights to various trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names that are used in the operation of our business. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products and other proprietary materials.Human Capital Resources
