BUSINESS
Overview
We are a provider of postsecondary education services through our regionally accredited academic institution, Ashford University®.
In March 2005, we acquired Ashford University, whose mission is to provide high-quality, accessible, affordable, and innovative educational programs that meet the diverse needs of individuals pursuing advancement in their lives, professions, and communities. We believe Ashford University is helping to define the modern college experience by providing the flexibility and effectiveness of online learning. The institution offers associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs primarily online. Ashford University is comprised of five colleges: the Forbes School of Business and Technology™, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science, the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Doctoral Studies. As of December 31, 2018, Ashford University had a total of 38,153 students enrolled.
Ashford University is committed to providing a high-quality educational experience to its students. Our institution's online delivery models, weekly start dates, commitment to affordability and transferability of credits make its programs highly attractive and accessible. Our institution's online platform has been designed to deliver a quality educational experience while offering the flexibility and convenience that many students require, particularly working adults. Ashford University has a comprehensive curriculum development process and employs qualified faculty members with significant academic and practitioner credentials. Ashford University conducts ongoing faculty and student assessment processes and provides a broad array of student services. We are also focused on providing innovative technologies to enhance the student experience and support faculty and student engagement.
Ashford University is accredited by WASC Senior College and University Commission (“WSCUC”). For additional information regarding accreditation, see “Regulation — Accreditation” below. Ashford University maintains a website at www.ashford.edu, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, or in any way a part of, this report.
Enrollment
The following table summarizes period-end enrollment as of each of the periods presented:

 | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016
Doctoral | 729 | | 1.9 | % | 841 | 2.1 | % | 836 | 1.9 | %
Master's | 5,804 | | 15.2 | % | 5,655 | 13.9 | % | 6,253 | 13.9 | %
Bachelor's | 29,604 | | 77.6 | % | 32,153 | 78.9 | % | 35,748 | 79.2 | %
Associate's | 1,323 | | 3.5 | % | 1,263 | 3.1 | % | 1,405 | 3.1 | %
Other* | 693 | | 1.8 | % | 818 | 2.0 | % | 845 | 1.9 | %
Total | 38,153 | | 100.0 | % | 40,730 | 100.0 | % | 45,087 | 100.0 | %

* Includes students who are taking one or more courses at our institution but have not declared that they are pursuing a specific degree.
We define period-end enrollment as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period. A student is considered active if the student has attended a class within the prior 15 days or is on an institutionally-approved break not to exceed 45 days, unless the student has graduated or provided notice of withdrawal, or for new students who have completed their third week of attendance, and posted attendance in the fourth week.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 71% of our institution's students were female, 55% identified themselves as minorities and the average age was 35. Ashford University has online students throughout the United States and students in 20 different countries.

Graduation
As of December 31, 2018, more than 120,000 students have graduated from our institution. The total number of credits required to obtain a degree for online programs varies based on the type of degree: an associate's degree requires a minimum of 64 credits; a bachelor's degree requires a minimum of 120 credits; a master's degree requires a minimum of 30 credits; and a doctoral degree requires a minimum of 59 credits.
Many students have previously completed some postsecondary education and have credits they would like to transfer to a new degree program. We believe students should receive credit for their prior work and Ashford University works closely with its accrediting agency to obtain the right to accept transfer credits.
Tuition and Fees
Ashford University generally structures the tuition and fees for programs to be below combined Title IV loan limits and average grant awards, affording students who do not otherwise have the financial means to pursue an education the opportunity to gain access to our institution's programs. We recognize that private loans are increasingly difficult to obtain, which can prevent academically qualified students from pursuing an education at institutions with higher tuition and fees. We believe that helping to remove the financial burden of obtaining incremental private loans while pursuing a postsecondary education not only permits more students to access our institution's programs, but also enables students to focus more on their coursework and program completion while in school.
The price of our institution's courses varies based upon the number of credits per course (with most courses representing three credits), the degree level of the program and the discipline. Refer to the academic catalog for the relative price per credit for undergraduate and graduate courses.
Revenue realized from tuition is reduced by the amount of scholarships awarded to students. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $118.4 million, $103.6 million and $99.9 million, respectively, for institutional scholarships awarded to students.
Student Financing
Students finance their education at our institution through a combination of the various financing options described below.
Title IV programs
If a student attends any institution certified as Title IV eligible by the U.S. Department of Education (“Department”) and meets applicable student eligibility standards, that student may receive grants, loans, or both grants and loans to help fund their education under programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (“Title IV”). An institution participating in federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV (“Title IV programs”) must ensure that all program funds are accounted for and disbursed properly. To continue receiving program funds, students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress toward the completion of their program of study.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Ashford University derived 78.6% of its cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Federal Direct Loans
The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the “Direct Loan Program”) consists of two types of loans: Stafford loans, which are either subsidized or unsubsidized, and PLUS loans, which are made available to graduate and professional students, as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students. For a Direct Subsidized Loan, the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during grace periods and any approved periods of deferment, until the student's obligation to repay the loan begins. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not based on financial need and are available to students who do not qualify for a Direct Subsidized Loan, or in some cases, in addition to a Direct Subsidized Loan. Loan funds are paid to our institution, which in turn credits the student's account for tuition and fees and disburse any requested amounts in excess of tuition and fees to the student.
Under the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, interest rates will be established each year for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and PLUS loans for which the first disbursement is on or after July 1 of that year through the following June 30. The interest rate, once established, will be fixed and apply for the life of the loan. With respect to loans for which the first disbursement was on or after July 1, 2018 but before July 1, 2019, the interest rates are (i) 
6

5.1% for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, (ii) 6.6% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate/professional students and (iii) 7.6% for Direct PLUS loans.
Federal Pell Grant Program
Under the Federal Pell Grant Program, the Department makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. Under the August 2008 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, students were able to receive Pell Grant funds for attendance on a year-round basis, and could potentially receive more in a given year than the traditionally defined maximum annual amount. However, the U.S. Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 permanently repealed the Pell Grant provision that provided an otherwise eligible student with more than one Pell Grant in an award year, effective with the 2011-2012 award year. Beginning with the 2012-2013 award year, a student's eligibility to receive a Pell Grant was reduced from 18 semesters (or its equivalent) to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). The funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which is subject to change annually. The maximum funding amount for Pell Grant award year 2018-2019 increased to $6,095.
Non-Title IV funding sources
Other funding sources consist primarily of payments made in cash by individuals, private loans from third parties, reimbursement from corporate affiliates and government tuition assistance programs for military personnel, including veterans. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Ashford University derived 21.4% of its cash revenues from these other funding sources.
Financial aid processing
Our institution has dedicated staff that provide call center and transactional processing services for the online financial aid student populations, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. We believe this improves student financing outcomes and enhances efforts to comply with Title IV rules and regulations.
Curricula and Scheduling
Ashford University is committed to providing their students with a rigorous and rewarding academic experience that gives them the knowledge and experience necessary to be contributors, educators and leaders in their chosen professions. Ashford University seeks to maintain a high level of quality in curriculum, faculty and student support services, all of which contribute to the overall student experience. The curricula are reviewed periodically to ensure that content is refined and updated as necessary. Ashford University provides extensive student support services, including academic, administrative and technology support, to help maximize the success of its students. Additionally, Ashford University monitors the success of the educational delivery processes through periodic faculty and student assessments. Ashford University believes their commitment to quality is evident in the satisfaction and demonstrated proficiency of their students, which is measured at the completion of every course.
As of December 31, 2018, Ashford University offered approximately 1,250 courses and approximately 80 degree programs. The degree programs are offered through Ashford University's five various colleges, the Forbes School of Business and Technology, the College of Education, the College of Health, Human Services and Science, the College of Liberal Arts, and the College of Doctoral Studies.
Ashford University's online courses are offered with weekly start dates throughout the year, except for two weeks total in late December and early January. Courses typically run five to six weeks and all courses are offered in an asynchronous format so students can complete their coursework as their schedule permits. Online students typically enroll in one course at a time. This focused approach to learning allows the student to engage fully in each course. Doctoral students are required to participate in periodic seminars and to compose and defend a dissertation on an approved topic.
Program Development
Ashford University designs its academic offerings to meet the needs of a broad cross-section of prospective students. In addition to adding programs in high-demand disciplines, Ashford University enhances its programs through the addition of specializations. Specialization areas are comprised of a select number of courses within an existing program that supplement that program's required courses. Specializations are used to create an offering that is tailored to the specific objectives of a student population and, therefore, is more attractive to potential students interested in a particular program. We believe the addition of specializations represents a cost-effective way to both expand our market and further enhance the differentiation of programs in that market. Ashford University is expanding its portfolio of master's and doctoral degree programs, consistent with our commitment to a quality academic offering, and to pursue increased graduate student enrollments because we believe graduate students represent an attractive segment of the market.
7

Ashford University seeks to offer programs in disciplines in which we believe there is strong demand for education and significant opportunity for employment. Ashford University's current program portfolio includes offerings at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in the disciplines of business, education, psychology, social sciences and health sciences. Ashford University follows a defined process for identifying new degree program opportunities that incorporates student, faculty and market feedback, as well as macro trends in the relevant disciplines, in order to evaluate the expected level of demand for a new program prior to developing the content and marketing it to potential students.
Potential new programs and specializations are determined based on proposals submitted by faculty and staff and an assessment of overall market demand. Ashford University's faculty and academic leadership work in collaboration with our marketing team to research and select new programs that are expected to have strong demand and that can be developed at a reasonable cost. Programs are reviewed by the respective institution and must also receive approval through the normal governance process at the relevant institution. Once a program is selected for development, one or more subject matter experts are assigned to work with curriculum development staff to define measurable program-level student learning objectives. Each course in a program is designed to include learning activities that address the program objectives, foster student engagement and assess learning outcomes. All courses undergo extensive internal and external third-party quality assurance reviews before they are offered to students, and the new program is reviewed for approval through the appropriate governance processes. Following approval, an online program is conformed to the standards of our online learning management system and our marketing department creates a marketing plan for the program. In most cases, the time frame to identify, develop and internally approve a new program is approximately six months, not including the external regulatory approvals required before a program can be offered to students.
Comprehensive Assessment
Ashford University has developed and implemented a comprehensive assessment plan focused on student learning and effective instruction. The plan stipulates assessment of learning outcomes at the course, program and institutional levels. Learning outcomes are unique to each institution and demonstrate the skills that graduates should be able to demonstrate upon completion of their respective programs. With the assistance of our dedicated assessment team, our institution's faculty routinely evaluates and revises courses and learning resources based upon outcomes and institutional research data. Using direct and indirect measurements, student performance is assessed on an ongoing basis to help ensure student success.
We utilize Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment platform, which is an innovative, web-based assessment system of interactive rubrics, to gather data from specific learning activities. Data results from Waypoint Outcomes are shared with the student and are also accessible by the faculty and program administrators.
In addition to course and program assessments, faculty instructional performance is continuously assessed by institutional deans and instructional specialists and through the results of student surveys at the completion of each course. The results of all our assessment practices are reviewed by an assessment team, including faculty, and based on their conclusions, recommendations may be made to add to or modify programs.
Branding and Marketing
We have invested significant resources in developing processes and implementing technologies that allow us to effectively identify, recruit and retain qualified students. We develop and participate in various marketing activities to generate leads for prospective students and to build the Bridgepoint Education and Ashford University brands.
For Ashford University's online student population, we align ourselves with working adults, many of whom have already completed some postsecondary courses and are seeking an accessible, affordable education from a quality institution. The admissions policies that require a minimum age for online students at Ashford University are focused on attracting students with a greater commitment to completing their degrees.
The Ashford University branding campaigns utilize digital channels to communicate their message, and leads are generated from online sources. We also purchase keywords from search providers to generate online leads directly, rather than acquiring them solely through aggregators. Additionally, we have a team internally who focuses on generating online leads through search engine optimization techniques.
Recruiting and Admissions
Our institution employs teams who facilitate all aspects of enrollment and integration of a prospective student into a program of study. These teams consist of enrollment service advisors, financial services advisors and academic advisors. This structure promotes internal accountability among employees involved in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining new students.
8

Prospective student leads are managed through a customer relations management (“CRM”) system, which directs a lead for a prospective student to a recruiting team and assigns an enrollment service advisor within that team to serve as the primary liaison for that prospective student. Once contact with a prospective student is established, the enrollment service advisor, along with the academic and financial services advisors, begins an assessment process to determine if our institution's program offerings match the student's needs and objectives. Additionally, enrollment service advisors communicate other criteria, including expected duration and cost of the program, to the prospective student.
The enrollment service advisors go through a comprehensive training program that addresses our institution's academic offerings, financial aid options and the regulatory environment in which we operate, including the restrictions imposed by regulations on the admissions process. We place significant emphasis on regulatory requirements and demand an environment of strict compliance.
Our institution has a presence in both military and corporate channels. Our military and academic outreach teams work with military education services officers, as well as with the military students we serve, to demonstrate the quality, impact and value that our institution's programs provide to individuals in the organizations. We believe our institution's educational offerings are attractive to potential students in the military. Military students may frequently change locations or seek to complete a program intermittently over the course of several years. In the corporate channel, we have the Education Partnerships program. These corporate partnership programs provide companies with the opportunity to allow their employees to pursue and complete a college degree without incurring any student debt. We believe employers value our institution's affordability, which allows employer tuition reimbursements to be used more efficiently.
The admissions process is designed to offer access to prospective students who seek the benefits of a postsecondary education. Ashford University undergraduate students may qualify in various ways, including by having a high school diploma or a General Educational Development equivalent. Graduate level students at Ashford University are required to have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college and may be required to have a minimum grade point average or meet other criteria to qualify for admission to certain programs. Doctoral students are required to have a Master’s degree from a regionally or approved nationally accredited institution with a graduate-level cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher, or an earned Doctoral degree from a regionally or approved nationally accredited institution.
Retention
Once a student enrolls in an online program, the institution provides consistent, ongoing support to assist the student in acclimating to the online environment and to address challenges that arise in order to increase the likelihood that the student will persist through graduation.
Providing a superior learning experience to every student is a key component in retaining students at our institution. We believe that our team-based approach to recruitment and the robust student services we provide enhance retention because of each student's interaction with his or her team and the accountability inherent in the team structure. We also incorporate a systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their experience at our institution, providing encouragement and highlighting their progress. There are frequent personal interactions between academic advisors and students, which we view as a key component to our retention strategy. Ashford University has a retention committee that monitors performance metrics and other key data to analyze student retention rates, as well as the causes of and potential risks for student drops. In addition, our dispute resolution department serves as a neutral third-party for students to raise any concerns or complaints. Such concerns and complaints are then elevated to the appropriate department.
Ashford University has various programs focused on academic quality and student success that we believe help students succeed in their courses, help retain higher quality students and ultimately increase student retention. Ashford University has a free two-week orientation course that is mandatory for all incoming students who have not earned any previous college credits. The orientation is designed to provide students with a complete overview of the online classroom experience, prepare them for success in their courses and help them self-evaluate their readiness to succeed in an online college setting. The experience provides a realistic, up-front overview of expectations so that students are aware of what is expected of them as they prepare for their studies. Students also gain an understanding of how to access and navigate within the online classroom, so they can feel confident when they move to their first course in their respective programs. For students taking the orientation course, successful completion of the orientation is required before they can begin their first class.
Ashford University also offers the “Ashford Promise,” which allows a student to experience the first three weeks of his or her first class before incurring any financial obligation. After the first three weeks, students who do not demonstrate satisfactory academic progress, or those who simply opt out, will not be admitted as students. These individuals will not be responsible for any tuition or fees, and therefore will not incur any debt. We believe the Ashford Promise initiative helps increase student retention while reducing the financial risk to the student.

Technology
We have created a scalable technology system that we believe is secure, reliable and redundant, and permits our institution's courses and support services to be offered online.
Online course delivery and management
Ashford University utilizes the Canvas learning management system provided by Instructure, Inc. (“Instructure”), a third-party software and services provider. Canvas is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform that enables us to develop and deliver the latest in engaging online learning experiences. As a native cloud platform, Canvas software and data are hosted by Amazon Web Services, providing for a fast, secure and readily scalable experience for our institution's students and faculty. Additionally, students and faculty will have greater flexibility to learn and teach from anywhere, anytime and on any iOS or Android device.
Internal administration
Ashford University utilizes a CRM application from Campus Management Corp. for lead management, workflow, analytics, reporting and a complete view of our students. This tool enables Ashford University to view the entire student history from the lead to graduation, individually or in cohorts, and to respond appropriately. Additionally, Ashford University utilizes online application portals to accept, integrate and process student applications.
Ashford University utilizes CampusVue, a student information system provided by Campus Management Corp., to manage student data (including grades, attendance, status and financial aid) and to generate periodic management reports. This system interfaces with our online learning management system.
Innovation and new technologies
Central to our ideal of enabling learning anytime, anywhere, is the commitment to providing learning platforms and resources that make accessible learning a reality. These innovations include Constellation, our proprietary learning platform, Waypoint Outcomes, our proprietary assessment software, and our mobile application technology.
Constellation
Constellation is an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that increases the educational quality for online students at Ashford University. Constellation is our proprietary learning platform that takes the best features of traditional textbooks and combines them with the best features of the Internet to create a premium student experience. We developed Constellation as an alternative to third-party textbooks with digital course materials. Constellation gives students access to their digital course materials across platforms without sacrificing time-tested studying tools like highlighting and note taking. Constellation includes customized content geared to our institution's courses and students, combined with a robust set of features that make course materials engaging and accessible to students of various learning styles and abilities. Constellation is cloud-based and is compatible across operating systems, browsers and mobile technologies, including web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices. We have developed Constellation-enabled courses primarily in core classes to attempt to reach as many students as possible.
The Constellation team includes editors with extensive experience at leading textbook publishing firms. Highly qualified subject matter experts are recruited to author content that addresses course and institutional outcomes. Constellation digital texts are organized around our institution's accelerated courses.
Waypoint Outcomes
Waypoint Outcomes provides learning and assessment software to our institution. The software combines classic rubric grading scales with easy, efficient technology to help educators teach writing, critical thinking and cognitive skills. Its sophisticated grading palette frees teachers to focus on meaningful, personalized feedback for students by automating repetitive tasks.
Mobile application technology
Our institution offers mobile applications compatible with most web-enabled smartphones and tablet devices in order to increase the accessibility of the student learning experience. The applications enable students to use their mobile device to contact support staff, complete discussion posts and review important information regarding their academic status. We have received positive feedback from students indicating that these mobile applications further their learning experience, and we have incorporated feedback received into the periodic updates to these mobile applications.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Ashford University had approximately 200 full-time faculty roles, including programs chairs, as well as approximately 2,620 active adjunct faculty. Adjunct faculty members are part-time employees engaged on a course-by-course basis and are compensated based upon a fixed amount per course, which varies among faculty members based on each individual's experience and background. In addition to teaching assignments, adjunct faculty members may also be asked to serve on student committees, such as comprehensive examination and dissertation committees, or assist with course development.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its institution also employed approximately 1,970 combined non-faculty staff in the areas of university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance and other administrative functions. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us.
Competition
The postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive, with no private or public institution representing a significant market share. Our institution competes primarily with public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities. Many colleges and universities enroll working adults, in addition to traditional 18 to 24-year-old students. Many of those colleges and universities offer a variety of distance education and online initiatives.
We believe that competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include the reputation of the college or university among students and employers, the number of qualified and experienced faculty, the program costs, the relevant and accredited program offerings, the regulatory approvals, the convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes, the relative marketing and selling effectiveness, the time necessary to earn a degree and the level of student support services. We expect to encounter increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institution, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. In many instances, our institution's course content is produced by faculty and other content experts under work-for-hire agreements pursuant to which we own the course content in return for a fixed development fee. In certain limited cases, course content is licensed from third parties on a royalty fee basis.
Environmental Matters
We believe our facilities are in material compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in one reportable segment and we have no foreign operations or assets located outside of the United States. For information about our revenues from external customers, measures of profits and losses, and total assets, see our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Proposed Changes in the Structure of our Operations
We plan to undertake a conversion transaction pursuant to which Ashford University will separate from the Company through a series of conversion and merger transactions ultimately resulting in Ashford University being owned and operated by AU NFP, a California nonprofit public benefit corporation that was formed for the purpose of the conversion transaction and is independent of the Company. Following the proposed conversion and separation of Ashford University, we plan to operate as an education technology services provider that would provide certain services to AU NFP, and potentially, in the future, to other customers. The services to AU NFP would be provided pursuant to services agreements with the Company. The transactions described above are collectively hereinafter referred to as the “Proposed Transaction.”
11

We are continuing to finalize the terms of the Proposed Transaction with Ashford University and review various federal, state and other regulatory requirements and approvals that could impact the viability and timing of the Proposed Transaction. The Company and the boards of trustees of Ashford University and AU NFP are taking steps to protect Ashford University's and AU NFP’s independence in considering the conversion transaction in order to enable Ashford University and AU NFP to act in the best interests of Ashford University and its students. Neither the Company nor Ashford University are bound to move forward with the Proposed Transaction at this time.

REGULATION
Ashford University is an accredited institution of higher education that is subject to extensive regulation by a variety of agencies, including WSCUC, the agency that accredits Ashford University. Accrediting agencies provide an independent assessment of educational quality. Our institution is also subject to regulation by educational licensing authorities in states where our institution is physically located or conducts certain operations. We are also subject to regulation by the Department due to our participation in Title IV programs. To participate in Title IV programs, a school must maintain authorization by the state education agency or agencies where it is physically located, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department and be certified by the Department as an eligible institution. Institutions that participate in Title IV programs are subject to an extensive set of laws and regulations. The laws, regulations and standards of WSCUC, the Department and state agencies affect the vast majority of our institution's operations.
Accreditation
Prior to being institutionally accredited by WSCUC in July 2013, Ashford University had been accredited by HLC since 1950. WSCUC is one of seven regional accrediting agencies that accredits colleges and universities in the United States. Most traditional, public and private non-profit, degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these seven agencies.
Accreditation by WSCUC is recognized by the Department and by prospective students as a reliable indicator of educational quality. Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of an educational institution and its programs and an institution's effectiveness in carrying out its mission in areas including integrity, student performance, curriculum, educational effectiveness, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, financial stability and governance. To be recognized by the Department, an accrediting agency, among other things, must adopt specific standards to be maintained by educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institution's compliance with those standards, monitor compliance through periodic institutional reporting and the periodic renewal process and publicly designate those institutions that meet the agency's criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review by its accrediting agency to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity, quality and other standards required for accreditation. An institution that is determined not to meet the standards of accreditation may have its accreditation revoked or not renewed.
Accreditation is important to our institution as it establishes comprehensive criteria designed to promote educational quality and effectiveness. Accreditation also represents a public acknowledgment by a recognized independent agency of the quality and effectiveness of our institution and its programs. It also facilitates the transferability of educational credits when students transfer to or apply for graduate school at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. The Department relies on accreditation as an indicator of educational quality and effectiveness in determining an institution's eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, as do certain corporate and government sponsors in connection with tuition reimbursement and other student aid programs.
We believe that regional accreditation is viewed favorably by certain students when choosing a school, by other schools when evaluating transfer and graduate school applications, and by certain employers when evaluating the credentials of candidates for employment.
WSCUC Accreditation of Ashford University
In July 2013, WSCUC granted Initial Accreditation to Ashford University for five years, until July 15, 2018. In December 2013, Ashford University effected its transition to WSCUC accreditation and designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus and its Clinton, Iowa campus as an additional location. As part of a continuing monitoring process, Ashford University hosted a visiting team from WSCUC on a special visit in April 2015. In July 2015, Ashford University received an Action Letter from WSCUC outlining the findings arising out of its visiting team's special visit. The Action Letter stated that the WSCUC visiting team found evidence that Ashford University continues to make progress in all six areas recommended by WSCUC in 2013. As part of its institutional review process, WSCUC commenced its comprehensive review of Ashford University with an off-site review in March 2018. Ashford University was notified on June 8, 2018 that the Ashford University Accreditation Visit originally scheduled for fall 2018 had been rescheduled to April 3-5, 2019.
Licensure by California BPPE
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. Ashford University is approved by the California BPPE to operate as an accredited institution. As a result, the university is subject to laws and regulations applicable to private, postsecondary educational institutions located in California, including reporting requirements related to graduation, employment and licensing 
13

data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies. Ashford University also remains subject to other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements.
Negotiated Rulemaking and Other Executive Action
On July 31, 2018, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register announcing their intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. In September 2018, interested parties commented at three public hearings on the topics suggested by the Department in the notice, and suggested additional topics for consideration for action by the negotiated rulemaking committee. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee and Subcommittees will meet January through March of 2019 in an attempt to reach consensus on these topics.
The proposed topics for negotiation include those regarding accreditation agencies, such as requirements for accrediting agencies in their oversight of member institutions; requirements for accrediting agencies to honor institutional mission; criteria used by the Secretary to recognize accrediting agencies, emphasizing criteria that focus on educational quality; developing a single definition for purposes of measuring and reporting job placement rates; and simplifying the Department's process for recognition and review of accrediting agencies.
Additional proposed topics outside of those regarding accreditation agencies include: state authorization, to address the requirements related to programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses, including disclosures about such programs to enrolled and prospective students, and other state authorization issues; the definition of “regular and substantive interaction,” as that term is used in the definitions of “correspondence course” and “distance education”; the definition of the term “credit hour”; the requirement that an institution demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of a program and entry-level requirements for the recognized occupation for which the program prepares the student; the arrangements between an institution and another institution or organization to provide a portion of an educational program; the roles and responsibilities of institutions and accrediting agencies in the teach-out process; the barriers to innovation and competition in postsecondary education or to student completion, graduation, or employment, including, but not limited to, those contained in the Department's institutional eligibility regulations and student assistance general provisions; and direct assessment programs and competency-based education, including consideration of regulations that are barriers to the implementation of such programs, such as certain requirements for term-based academic calendars and satisfactory academic progress.
For additional information regarding negotiated rulemaking, see also “Gainful employment” and “Defense to Repayment” sections below.
Authorization by Congress of Title IV Programs
Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014 and on December 13, 2017, the House of Representatives’ Committee on Education and the Workforce passed H.R. 4508, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (“PROSPER Act”). No date has been set for consideration by the full House on the legislation, nor has a companion Higher Education Act reauthorization bill been introduced in the U.S. Senate. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.
Department Regulation of Title IV Programs
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with the Higher Education Act and the regulations thereunder that are administered by the Department. Among other things, the law and regulations require that an institution (i) be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located, (ii) maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized for such purposes by the Department and (iii) be certified to participate in Title IV programs by the Department. Our institution's participation in Title IV programs allows for extensive oversight and review pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Department. Those regulations are subject to revision and amendment from time to time by the Department. The Department's interpretation of its regulations likewise is subject to change. As a result, it is difficult to predict how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances.
An institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification.

On April 23, 2018, Ashford University received an updated Program Participation Agreement from the Department. Based on the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until March 31, 2021. Ashford University is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2020.
During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs.
The 90/10 rule
Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. This rule is commonly referred to as the “90/10 rule.” Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year is placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In September 2016, the Department issued new audit standards, for financial statement audits of proprietary institutions for fiscal years ending June 30, 2017 or later, which include a requirement that institutions must determine Title IV and non-Title IV revenue on a student by student basis. Based on this calculation, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Ashford University derived 78.6% and 80.8%, respectively, of its respective cash revenues from Title IV program funds.
Revenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule, and accordingly helps our institution satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 26.7% of our institution's students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees.
Cohort default rate
For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a “cohort default rate.” An institution may lose eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year.
The most recent official three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 federal fiscal years were 13.5%, 14.9% and 14.5%, respectively. The draft three-year cohort default rate for Ashford University for the 2016 federal fiscal year was 13.7%.
Financial responsibility
The Higher Education Act and Department regulations establish standards of financial responsibility that an institution must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. The Department evaluates compliance with these standards annually upon receipt of an institution's annual audited financial statements and when an institution applies to the Department to reestablish its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs following a change in ownership. One financial responsibility standard is based on the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department. The composite score is a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. It must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department financial oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, meet all its financial obligations (including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts), be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements.
For the prior fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the consolidated composite score calculated was 2.3, satisfying the composite score requirement of the Department's financial responsibility test. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we expect the consolidated composite score to be 2.2. However, the consolidated calculation is subject to determination by the Department once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the composite score at our institution is higher than the consolidated score.
15

Substantial misrepresentation
The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Under the Department's rules, a “misrepresentation” is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives or any ineligible institution, organization or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs or marketing, advertising, recruiting or admissions services makes directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency or the Department. The Department's rules define a “substantial misrepresentation” as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
On December 10, 2015, Ashford University received a request for information from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (“FSA”) for (i) advertising and marketing materials provided to prospective students regarding the transferability of certain credit, (ii) documents produced in response to the CFPB's August 10, 2015 Civil Investigative Demand related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit postsecondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans, (iii) certain documents produced in response to subpoenas and interrogatories issued by the Attorney General of the State of California and (iv) records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. The FSA is reviewing representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford to assist in its assessment of Ashford's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford, intend to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices.
The Department is currently conducting a program review to assess Ashford University's administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. For additional information regarding the program review, see “Compliance reviews, audits and reports — Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford University” below. For additional information regarding substantial misrepresentation, see “Defense to Repayment” below.
Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw
If a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has earned pursuant to applicable regulations. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any payment period (which, for our undergraduate online students, is typically a 20-week term consisting of four five-week courses), the amount of Title IV funds that the student has earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds the student received or for which the student would otherwise be eligible for the payment period. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student is deemed to have earned 100% of the Title IV funds received. If the student has not earned all the Title IV funds disbursed, the institution must return the unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the Department in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If an institution's annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years determines that 5% or more of such returns were not timely made, the institution may be required to submit a letter of credit in favor of the Department equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our institution did not exceed the 5% threshold for late refunds sampled.
Gainful employment
In October 2014, the Department published gainful employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The gainful employment regulations became effective July 1, 2015, with certain institutional disclosure requirements effective early 2017. The gainful employment regulations have a framework with three components:

• | Certification: Institutions must certify that each of their gainful employment programs meet state and federal licensure, certification and accreditation requirements.


• | Accountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, gainful employment programs will be required to meet minimum standards for the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates.


◦ | Pass: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments less than 8% of total earnings or less than 20% of discretionary earnings.

16


◦ | Zone: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments between 8% and 12% of total earnings or between 20% and 30% of discretionary earnings.


◦ | Fail: Programs whose graduates have annual loan payments greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary earnings.

Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or are in the Zone for four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs.

• | Transparency: Institutions will be required to make public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs. The disclosures will include information such as costs, earnings, debt and completion rates.

The accountability measures will typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year and earnings from the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus, for the 2014-2015 academic year, the two-year cohort will include graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for those graduates from calendar year 2014.
In October 2016, Ashford received draft debt-to-earnings rates and certain underlying data from the Department for the first gainful employment measurement year. In January 2017, we received our institution's final debt-to-earnings rates for the first gainful employment measurement year. Based on the final rates, none of our programs were determined to fail. Two of our current programs, including the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration, were determined to be in the zone. At December 31, 2018, approximately 3.3% of our institution's students were enrolled in the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and approximately 8.9% of our institution's students were enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived revenue of approximately $14.3 million from the Associate of Arts in Early Childhood Education and approximately $39.7 million from the Bachelor of Arts in Early Childhood Education/Administration.
The fact that none of our programs were determined to fail and only two of our current programs were determined to be in the zone is significant given the framework discussed above, as a program would be disqualified from participation in Title IV programs only if it were to fail for two out of three consecutive years, or either fail or be in the zone for three out of four consecutive years. The gainful employment regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility.
On June 15, 2017, the Department announced its intention to conduct additional negotiated rulemaking on certain issues related to gainful employment. Because the negotiated rulemaking committee did not reach consensus, the Department planned to publish a proposed regulation through a NPRM, take public comment, and issue final regulations by November 1, 2018, with the final regulations effective July 1, 2019. This did not occur.
On June 30, 2017, the Department granted institutions until July 1, 2018 to comply with disclosure provisions related to promotional materials and prospective students, and extended the deadline for all programs to file alternate earnings appeals. The Department did not change a July 1, 2017 deadline requiring institutions to provide a completed disclosure template, or a link thereto, on gainful employment program web pages and our schools have complied with this requirement. In January 2018, the Department announced the release of the 2018 gainful employment template. While the aesthetic of the template remained the same, the Department removed certain data points. This included the amount for off-campus room and board, the percentage of students who borrow money to pay for the degree program, and the typical annual earnings after leaving the program.
On March 16, 2018, the Department announced it would release a new draft gainful employment completers list in late spring. On April 27, 2018, the Department announced that it would send institutions their completers list on April 30, 2018. Schools had until June 13, 2018 to review, correct, and submit the lists back to the Department and our institution timely submitted. The Department has not announced when schools can expect the next round of draft debt-to-earnings rates.
On June 18, 2018, the Department announced it will allow additional time, until July 1, 2019, for institutions to comply with the requirements of the gainful employment regulations in 34 CFR 668.412 (d) and (e) that include the disclosure template, or a link thereto, in their gainful employment program promotional materials; and directly distribute the disclosure template to prospective students. Because the Department intends to develop proposed regulations that would replace the gainful employment regulations, and as part of that rulemaking process, the Department continues to evaluate the efficacy of these disclosures to students and the implementation of these requirements. Institutions must continue to comply with the requirements in 34 CFR 668.412(a), (b), and (c) to post disclosures on their gainful employment program web pages using the 
17

approved disclosure template provided by the Department. The deadline for these actions was April 6, 2018 and, as discussed above, our institution complied with this requirement.
On August 14, 2018, the Department proposed to rescind the gainful employment regulations and update the College Scorecard, a web-based tool, to provide program-level outcomes for all higher education programs at all institutions that participate in Title IV. On August 24, 2018, the Department announced that it would still require institutions to comply with the October 1, 2018 reporting requirement. Schools were to submit gainful employment program data for the 2017-18 Award Year to the National Student Loan Data System by October 1, 2018. Our institution submitted this reporting timely.
We continue to review the information provided by the Department to understand the potential impact of the gainful employment regulations on our programs. We also continue to evaluate options related to new programs or adjustments to current programs that could help mitigate the potential adverse consequences of the regulations. We will also continue to monitor changes to the existing regulations.
Defense to repayment
On June 18, 2015, the Department announced processes that would be established to assist students in gaining relief under the “defense to repayment” provisions of the Direct Loan Program regulations. The defense to repayment provisions then in effect allowed a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal direct loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services for which the loans were provided.
On June 16, 2016, the Department published proposed regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment and related matters, and on October 28, 2016, the Department published its final regulations with an effective date of July 1, 2017.
On June 14, 2017, the Department announced a postponement of the 2016 defense to repayment regulations and its intention to resubmit the regulations through the negotiated rulemaking process. The Department announced an additional postponement on October 24, 2017. On February 14, 2018, the Department announced that it was postponing the effective date of this rule until July 1, 2019 so that it could complete the negotiated rulemaking process and develop the new regulations. Because the negotiated rulemaking committee did not reach consensus, the Department published a proposed regulation through an NPRM, took public comment, and planned to issue final regulations by November 1, 2018, effective July 1, 2019. This did not occur.
In September and October of 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a series of orders and opinions holding these procedural delays by the Department to be improper. The Court reinstated the 2016 repayment regulations as of October 16, 2018.
The 2016 regulations allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable nondefault contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower’s loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the new regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The new regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.
We will continue to monitor guidance on or changes to the existing regulations.
Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations
The Department can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including:

• | transferring an institution from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permit the institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the Department;

18


• | imposing a monetary liability against an institution in an amount equal to any funds determined to have been improperly disbursed or not to have been properly returned upon student withdrawal;


• | requiring an institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department as a condition for continued Title IV eligibility;


• | initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs;


• | referring a matter for possible civil or criminal investigation;


• | failing to grant an institution's application for renewal of its certification, or revocation of an institution's provisional certification, to participate in Title IV programs, or imposing conditions on its participation in Title IV programs; or


• | taking emergency action to suspend an institution's participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or a prior opportunity for a hearing.

Compliance reviews, audits and reports
Our institution is subject to reviews in connection with periodic renewals of certification to participate in Title IV programs, as well as announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department and the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”). The Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OIG is responsible for promoting the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of the Department's programs and operations, including through the performance of general audits of institutions' administration of federal funds and investigations of fraud, abuse or other wrongdoing by institutions.
State licensing agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and accrediting bodies may also conduct audits and reviews of a similar fashion. In addition, as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the Higher Education Act requires institutions to submit to the Department an annual Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accounting firm. Each institution must also annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and Department regulations to enable the Department to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility.
Department of Education Open Program Review of Ashford University
On July 7, 2016, Ashford University was notified by the Department that an off-site program review had been scheduled to assess Ashford University’s administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates. The off-site program review commenced on July 25, 2016 and covered students identified in the 2009-2012 calendar year data previously provided by Ashford University to the Department in response to a request for information received from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the Department’s Office of Federal Student Aid (the “FSA”) on December 10, 2015, but may be expanded if the Department deems such expansion appropriate.
On December 9, 2016, the Department informed Ashford University that it intended to continue the program review on-site at Ashford. The on-site program review commenced on January 23, 2017 and initially covered the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 award years, but may be expanded if the Department deems such an expansion appropriate. To date, we have not received a draft report from the Department.
GI Bill Benefits
On May 20, 2016, the Company received a letter from the Iowa Department of Education (“Iowa DOE”) indicating that, as a result of the planned closure of the Clinton Campus, the Iowa State Approving Agency (“ISAA”) would no longer continue to approve Ashford University’s programs for GI Bill benefits after June 30, 2016, and recommending Ashford University seek approval through the State Approving Agency of jurisdiction for any location that meets the definition of a “main campus” or “branch campus.” Ashford University began the process of applying for approval through the State Approving Agency in California (“CSAAVE”), and the Company subsequently disclosed that on June 20, 2016 it received a second letter from the Iowa DOE indicating that the Iowa DOE had issued a stay of the ISAA’s withdrawal of approval of Ashford University’s programs for GI Bill benefits effective immediately until the earlier of (i) 90 days from June 20, 2016 or (ii) the date on which CSAAVE completed its review and issued a decision regarding the approval of Ashford University in California. Ashford University received communication from CSAAVE indicating that additional information and documentation would be required before Ashford University’s application could be considered for CSAAVE approval. Ashford University subsequently withdrew the CSAAVE application and continued working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), the Iowa DOE and the ISAA to obtain continued approval of Ashford University’s programs for GI Bill benefits and to prevent any disruption of educational benefits to Ashford University's veteran students.
19

On September 15, 2016, in response to a Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Petition”) filed by Ashford University, the Iowa District Court for Polk County entered a written order (“Order”) staying the Iowa DOE’s announced intention to withdraw the approval of Ashford University as a GI Bill eligible institution until the entry of a final and appealable order and judgment in the action. On June 23, 2017, the Iowa District Court held a hearing on Ashford University’s Petition and on July 17, 2017, the Court ruled in favor of the Iowa DOE and denied the petition. Ashford University filed a motion for reconsideration of this ruling, which was denied on August 17, 2017. On August 23, 2017, Ashford University filed a Petition to Vacate or Modify the Iowa District Court’s July 17, 2017 ruling, based on material evidence, newly discovered, which could not with reasonable diligence have been previously discovered by Ashford University (“First Petition to Vacate”). On September 18, 2017, Ashford University appealed, inter alia, the July 17, 2017 ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court and posted an appeal bond, which stayed this matter pending resolution of Ashford University’s appeal. As a result, Ashford University’s approval was not withdrawn, and Ashford University’s programs remain approved for GI Bill purposes. The Assistant Attorney General handling this matter on behalf of the Iowa DOE also advised Ashford University that the Iowa DOE would take no action pending the post-ruling motions and appeal. On October 12, 2017, Judge Eliza Ovrom, the Iowa District Court Judge who issued the July 17, 2017 ruling, filed a Disclosure Statement revealing family ties to the Iowa Attorney General’s Office. Following motions by Ashford University for her recusal, Judge Ovrom recused herself from all further proceedings. On October 24, 2017, Ashford University filed with the Iowa Supreme Court a Petition to Vacate or, in the Alternative, for Limited Remand (“Second Petition to Vacate”), in which Ashford University argued that the July 17, 2017 ruling and all other material orders entered by Judge Ovrom should be vacated due to her previously undisclosed conflict of interest. On January 8, 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court remanded the Second Petition to Vacate to the District Court, where all proceedings in this matter were consolidated before Judge Michael Huppert. On April 26, 2018, Judge Huppert granted the Second Petition to Vacate and vacated all material rulings by Judge Ovrom, including the July 17, 2017 ruling, thus on June 21, 2018, the Iowa Supreme Court issued a Procedendo stating that the appeal was concluded. Judge Huppert’s decision mooted the First Petition to Vacate and Ashford University’s appeal of, inter alia, the July 17, 2017 ruling. The case is now proceeding on the merits de novo before a new judge.
On July 6, 2017, Ashford University received approval from the Arizona State Approving Agency (“ASAA”) to provide GI Bill benefits to its students. On September 13, 2017, the VA accepted the ASAA’s approval, subject to Ashford University's compliance with the approval requirements, and the University subsequently received a facility code from the VA. On November 9, 2017, the VA informed Ashford University that the ASAA had not provided sufficient evidence to establish that it has jurisdictional authority over Ashford University’s online programs. The VA stated that they intend to suspend payment of educational assistance and approval of new student enrollments and student re-enrollments for Ashford University’s online programs in 60 days unless corrective action was taken.
On November 17, 2017, Ashford University filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the VA’s actions. In response to that petition, the VA agreed to stay the actions with respect to the suspension and reenrollment it had announced on November 9, 2017 through the entry of judgment in the Federal Circuit case, on the condition that Ashford University request and submit an application for approval to CSAAVE on or before January 8, 2018. Ashford University submitted an application to CSAAVE for approval on January 5, 2018. On February 21, 2018, CSAAVE provided notice of its intention not to act on Ashford University’s initial application for approval for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. The notice directed Ashford University to request approval of its application by the VA. Ashford University continues to work in good faith with the VA while its petition for review remains pending with the Federal Circuit. In keeping with this commitment, Ashford University agreed, at the VA’s request, to submit another application to CSAAVE. Ashford University filed that additional application on November 19, 2018. On December 14, 2018, however, CSAAVE again informed Ashford University that it did not intend to act on Ashford University’s application, and again indicated that Ashford University could request approval of its application directly from the VA.
On January 29, 2019, Ashford University filed its opening brief with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Under the briefing schedule established by the Court, VA’s opposition brief is currently due on April 1, 2019, and Ashford University’s reply is currently due on April 22, 2019.
Adding teaching locations and implementing new educational programs
The requirements and standards of accrediting agencies, state education agencies and the Department limit our institution's ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations or implement new educational programs. WSCUC and state education agencies that may authorize or accredit our institution or its programs, generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding certain new locations or implementing certain new programs, and may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. In addition, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must apply under certain circumstances to the Department to have the new location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility.
20

On April 23, 2018, Ashford University received an updated Program Participation Agreement from the Department. Based on the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University is provisionally certified to participate in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs until March 31, 2021. Ashford University was previously eligible to participate on a month-to-month basis while its reapplication for certification was pending with the Department. As a result of the updated Program Participation Agreement, Ashford University’s previously pending educational programs have been approved and Ashford University is required to submit its reapplication for continued certification by December 31, 2020. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs.
Change in ownership resulting in a change of control
The Department and most state and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes of control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or operations. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control may include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution's common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution's governing board. The types of thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and among accrediting agencies. The Department regulations provide that a change of control occurs for a publicly traded corporation if either (i) a person acquires such ownership and control of the corporation so that the corporation is required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control or (ii) the corporation's largest stockholder who owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation, ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder owning at least 25% of the total stock. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the Department to be a change of control under this standard. In such event, the regulatory procedures applicable to a change in ownership and control would have to be followed in connection with the transaction. Similarly, if such a disposition were deemed a change of control by the applicable accreditor or state educational licensing agency, any required regulatory notifications and approvals would have to be made or obtained.
Privacy of student records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (“FERPA”) and the Department's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to, among other things, protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department may require the institution to take corrective action or may terminate the institution's receipt of federal funds. Educational institutions are also obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which requires an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective action, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC.
State authorization
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. An institution is legally authorized by a state if, among other things, it meets one of the following sets of requirements:

• | the state establishes the institution by name as an educational institution through a charter, statute, constitutional provision or other action issued by an appropriate state agency or state entity and is authorized to operate educational programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements, except that the state may exempt the institution from any state approval or licensure requirement based on the institution's accreditation by one or more accrediting agencies recognized by the Department or based upon the institution being in operation for at least 20 years; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws;


• | the institution is established by the state on the basis of an authorization to conduct business in the state or to operate as a nonprofit charitable organization; the institution, by name, is approved or licensed by the state to offer programs beyond secondary education, including programs leading to a degree or certificate; and the institution is not exempt from the state's approval or licensure requirements based on accreditation, years in operation, or other comparable exemption; and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution including the enforcement of state laws; or

21


• | the institution is exempt from state authorization as a religious institution under the state constitution or by state law, and the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution and to enforce applicable state laws.

The Department has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, the above requirements, and it is unclear how the Department will interpret these requirements in each state.
The regulations also provide that if an institution is offering postsecondary education through distance or correspondence education to students in a state in which it is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state, the institution must meet any state requirements to legally offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education to students in that state. Additionally, upon request by the Department, an institution must be able to document that it has the applicable state approval. For additional information, see “— State Education Licensure and Regulation” below.
State Education Licensure and Regulation
California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado
The Higher Education Act requires Ashford University to be legally authorized in the states in which it is physically located to participate in Title IV programs, and Department regulations impose Title IV program requirements for an institution to be considered legally authorized by a state.
Ashford University has designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes. Ashford University timely submitted to California BPPE an application to renew its approval to operate as an accredited institution on May 7, 2018. Ashford University remains authorized in the state of California by California BPPE while the renewal application is pending review and approval. For additional information, see “Regulation - Licensure by California BPPE” above. Ashford University also has physical locations in Arizona, Colorado and Iowa. Ashford University is authorized to operate an administrative center in Arizona by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (“State Board”) until June 30, 2019. To maintain its Arizona authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Arizona statutes and rules. Ashford University is authorized to operate as a place of business in Colorado by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. To maintain its Colorado authorization, the university must comply with applicable requirements under Colorado statutes and rules. Ashford is registered as a postsecondary school in Iowa by the Iowa College Student Aid Commission (“ICSAC”) until November 20, 2019. To maintain its Iowa registration, Ashford must comply with applicable requirements under Iowa statutes and rules.
Additional state regulation
Most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over out-of-state educational institutions offering online programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. In addition to California, Arizona, Iowa and Colorado, we have determined that our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the applicable state education agency, and we have obtained state education agency approvals in certain states as determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. We review state licensure requirements on a regular basis to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization. Because we enroll students throughout the United States, we may have to seek licensure or authorization in additional states in the future.
