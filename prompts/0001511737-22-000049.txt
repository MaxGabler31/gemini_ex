Item 1. Business
Business Overview 
The Company was founded by Robert Pera in 2005. We sell equipment, and provide the related software platforms, worldwide through a network of over 100 distributors, on-line retailers and direct to customers through our webstores. Ubiquiti Inc. is focused on democratizing network technology on a global scale. Our devices play a role in creating networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories around the world. Our professional networking products are powered by our UISP and UniFi OS software platforms to provide high-capacity distributed Internet access and unified information technology management, respectively.
We develop technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and consumer electronics for professional, home and personal use. We categorize our solutions into three main categories: high performance networking technology for enterprises, service providers and consumers. We target the enterprise and service provider markets through our highly engaged community of service providers, distributors, value added resellers, webstores, systems integrators and corporate IT professionals, which we refer to as the Ubiquiti Community. We target consumers through digital marketing, including 
through our webstores, retail chains and, to a lesser extent, the Ubiquiti Community.
In addition to Mr. Pera, our founder, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, who is central to our business, the majority of our human capital resources consist of entrepreneurial and de-centralized research and development (“R&D”) personnel. We do not employ a traditional direct sales force, but instead drive brand awareness through online reviews and publications, our website, our distributors and the Company’s user community where customers can interface directly with our R&D, marketing, and support teams. Our technology platforms were designed from the ground up with a focus on delivering highly-advanced and easily-deployable solutions that appeal to a global customer base.
We offer a broad and expanding portfolio of networking products and solutions for operator-owners of wireless internet services (“WISP’s”), enterprises and smart homes. Our operator-owner service-provider-product platforms provide carrier-class network infrastructure for fixed wireless broadband, wireless backhaul systems and routing and the related software for WISP’s to easily control, track and bill their customers. Our enterprise product platforms provide wireless LAN (“WLAN”) infrastructure, video surveillance products, switching and routing solutions, security gateways, door access systems, and other complimentary WLAN products along with a unique software platform, which enables users to control their network from one simple, easy to use software interface. Our consumer products are targeted to the smart home and highly connected consumers. We believe that our products are differentiated due to our proprietary software, firmware expertise, and hardware design capabilities.
We operate our business as one reportable and operating segment. Further information regarding Segments can be found in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revenues were $1.7 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We reported net income of $378.7 million, $616.6 million and $380.3 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more financial information.
Industry Overview 
Internet traffic worldwide has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by an increase in the number of users, increasing mobility of those users and high bandwidth applications, such as video, audio, cloud-based applications, online gaming and social networking. According to Cisco Annual Internet Report, internet users as a percentage of global population will be 66% in 2023, an increase from 51% in 2018. Additionally, it is estimated that there will be 3.6 networked devices per capita connected to IP networks in 2023, up from 2.4 networked devices per capita in 2018. Wired networking solutions have traditionally been used to address increasing consumer and enterprise bandwidth needs. However, the high initial capital requirements and ongoing operating costs and long market lead times associated with building and installing infrastructure for wired networks has severely limited the widespread deployment of these networks in underserved and underpenetrated markets. Wireless networks have emerged as an attractive alternative for addressing the broadband access needs of underserved and underpenetrated markets in both emerging and developed countries.
Our Technology and Products
We offer products and solutions based on our proprietary technology across multiple markets. Utilizing low-cost hardware and innovative software and firmware, we seek to build price- performance solutions to address both enterprises and service providers.

We offer consumer products, called AmpliFi and Alien, which are Wi-Fi system solutions designed to serve the demands of the modern connected home. We continue to explore consumer related market opportunities and have research and development teams focused on consumer related solutions.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development and testing of our products. Our geographically-distributed engineering team has deep expertise and experience in networking and antenna design, and we have a number of personnel with longstanding experience with network architecture and operation. We have developed and intend to continue to develop our technology in part by operating with a relatively flat reporting structure that relies on individual contributors or small development teams to develop, test and obtain feedback for our products.
As of June 30, 2022, our research and development team consisted of 978 full time equivalent employees, including contractors, located in the United States, Taiwan, China, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Ukraine, Poland, and elsewhere. Our research and development operations work on product development of new products and new versions of existing products. Our research and development expenses were $137.7 million, $116.2 million and $89.4 million for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. We expect that the number of our research and development personnel will increase over time and that our research and development expenses will also increase. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with our international workforce and operations, refer to risk factors under “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our International Operations.”
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We use contract manufacturers, primarily located in China and Vietnam, to manufacture our products. Over the long term, our contract manufacturers are not required to manufacture our products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. If necessary, we expect that it would take approximately three to six months to transition manufacturing, quality assurance and shipping services to new providers. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with our contract manufacturers, see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - We rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to produce our products. Shortages of components or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or delay our ability to fulfill future orders and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.”
We rely on third party components and technology to build and operate our products, and we rely on our contract manufacturers to obtain the components, subassemblies and products necessary for the manufacture of our products. While components and supplies in the past have been generally available from a variety of sources, we and our contract manufacturers currently depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for several components for our products and the impact of COVID-19 and the current shortage of chips has limited out ability to meet demand. We and our contract manufacturers rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers. The majority of our product revenues are dependent upon the sale of products that incorporate components from a small number of suppliers. We are party to non-exclusive license agreements with some of these suppliers whereby we license certain technology that we incorporate into our products. These agreements generally automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless the agreements are terminated by written notice of nonrenewal with advance notice prior to the end of their then-current term. The Company has not received any termination notice as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We depend on these license agreements to modify and replace firmware on certain chipsets with our proprietary firmware. While our agreements with suppliers remains effective, the terms of these agreements, allow either party to terminate the agreements without cause at the end of the annual contract term.
Our inability to procure sufficient quantities of certain components during fiscal 2022, including chipsets, has had a negative impact 
on our ability to manufacture our products and increased the costs associated therewith, and we expect these supply constraints, and their negative impact on our manufacturing output and associated costs, to continue. We do not stockpile sufficient components, particularly the chipsets, to cover the time it would take to re-engineer our products to replace the components which comprise the raw materials for our product offerings and we generally do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers for these components (including the chipsets). While we have attempted to mitigate supply shortages through our contract manufacturers and exploring open-market avenues to procure the necessary components, but we expect to experience continuing challenges in terms of securing our supply of such components and pricing inflation for the components to manufacture our products. If we need to seek a suitable second source for these components for our products, there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully source our chipsets on suitable terms, if at all. In any event, our use of chipsets from multiple sources may require us to significantly modify our designs and manufacturing processes to accommodate these different chipsets. We believe any shortage or delay in the supply of these components would harm our ability to continue to manufacture and supply our products, which would adversely affect our product offerings and revenues. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the shortages of components, see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - We rely upon a limited number of suppliers. If these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or we are unable to manage our supply requirements through other sources, could disrupt our business or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.”
We have experienced a major disruption in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic due to COVID-19 related restrictions that have significantly impacted our suppliers’ ability to manufacture or provide key components or services, as well as shipping and logistics delays. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Our contract manufacturers, logistics centers and certain administrative and research and development operations, as well as our customers and suppliers, are located in areas likely to be subject to natural disasters, public health problems, military conflicts and geopolitical tensions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Tariffs
In June 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced new proposed tariffs for certain products imported into the U.S. from China. The vast majority of our products that are imported into the U.S. from China are currently subject to tariffs that range between 7.5% and 25%. On January 22, 2020, the United States of Trade Representative announced it will reduce Section 301 List 4A additional tariffs from 15% to 7.5% and the List 4B tariffs would not go into effect. These tariffs have already affected our operating results and margins. For so long as such tariffs are in effect, we expect it will continue to affect our operating results and margins. As a result, our historical and current gross profit margins may not be indicative of our gross profit margins for future periods. Refer to “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our International Operations”. Our business may be negatively affected by political events and foreign policy responses” for additional information.
Sales and Distribution
We sell our products and solutions globally to enterprises and service providers primarily through our extensive network of distributors, and, to a lesser extent, direct customers. During fiscal 2022, we sold our products to over 100 distributors and direct to customers through our webstores (collectively, “customers”) in over 75 countries. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, there were no customers that represented 10% or more of our revenue, while in in fiscal 2020, only one customer represented 10% or more of our revenue. Refer to Note 15 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding financial data by geographic areas.
A majority of our sales are made outside the United States and we anticipate that non-U.S. sales will continue to be a significant portion of our revenues. We do not have any visibility on the location or extent of purchases of our products by individual network operators and service providers from our distributors. For further discussion of the risks associated with foreign operations, see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our International Operations”.
Backlog
Our sales are primarily made through standard sale orders for delivery of products. Our inability to procure sufficient product due to COVID-19 and the worldwide chip shortage has led to a significant increase in our backlog of unfulfilled orders. However, we do not believe our backlog information is a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Competition
The markets for networking solutions for service providers, enterprise WLAN, video surveillance, microwave backhaul and 
machine-to-machine communications technology are highly competitive and are influenced by the following competitive factors, among others:

•total cost of ownership and return on investment associated with the solutions;
•simplicity of deployment and use of the solutions;
•ability to rapidly develop high performance integrated solutions;
•reliability and scalability of the solutions;
•market awareness of a particular brand;
•ability to provide secure access to wireless networks;
•ability to offer a suite of products and solutions;
•ability to allow centralized management of the solutions; and
•ability to provide quality product support.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We have been successful in rapidly developing high performance integrated solutions because we use individual contributors and small, experienced development teams that focus on the key needs of the markets. Our products and solutions are designed to meet the price- performance characteristics demanded by our customers to achieve a strong overall return on their investment. Our products are designed to operate in growing networks without degradation in performance or operational complexity.
In the backhaul market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, Ceragon Networks, MikroTîkls, Airspan, SAF Tehnika and Trango. In the CPE market, our competitors include Cambium Networks, MikroTîkls, Ruckus Wireless (CommScope)and TP-LINK Technologies. In the antenna market, we primarily compete with PCTEL, ARC, ITELITE and Radio Waves. In the enterprise WLAN market, we primarily compete with Huawei, Aerohive Networks, Aruba Networks (HPE), Ruckus Wireless (CommScope), Cisco Meraki and Cisco. In the video surveillance market, we primarily compete with Axis Communications, HIKVISION, Mobotix and Vivotek. We expect increased competition from other established and emerging companies if our market continues to develop and expand. As we enter new markets, we expect to face competition from incumbent and new market participants.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection and the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services and products are available. We seek patent protection for certain of our key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions.
We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other countries. We have also filed, and will continue to file, patent applications and trademark applications in the United States and other countries where we believe there to be a strategic technological or business reason to do so. Any patents or trademarks issued to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. There can be no assurance that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our intellectual property rights will give us competitive advantage.
We endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on the success of our legal actions against infringers and counterfeiters, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. For further discussion of the risks associated with intellectual property, see “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property”.
Human Capital
As of June 30, 2022, we employed and or contracted with 1,377 full time equivalent employees, of which 978 were in research and development, 317 in operations, and 82 in sales, general and administrative. Our workforce is diversified across multiple locations with 65%, 23% and 12% located in (i) Asia Pacific, (ii) Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) the Americas, respectively. The Company believes that its entrepreneurial, decentralized, and diversified work environment has contributed to its success. We seek to maintain a culture of accountability and performance that enables us to deliver highly-advanced and easily deployable solutions that appeal to a global market.
