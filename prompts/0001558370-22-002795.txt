TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage strategically come together under our unified offering, Humanify® CXaaS, which drives measurable customer results for clients through the delivery of personalized, omnichannel experiences. Our Humanify® cloud platform provides a fully integrated ecosystem of CX offerings, including messaging, AI, machine learning (“ML”), robotic process automation (“RPA”), analytics, cybersecurity, CRM, knowledge management, journey orchestration, and traditional voice solutions. Our end-to-end CXaaS platform differentiates us from competitors by combining design, strategic consulting, technology, data analytics, process optimization, system integration, and operational excellence along with our decades of industry know-how. This unified offering is value-oriented, outcome-based and delivered to large enterprises, governments, and hypergrowth companies on a global scale.
During 2021, the TTEC global operating platform delivered onshore, nearshore and offshore services in 20 countries on six continents -- the United States, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom – with the help of 65,000 consultants, technologists, and CX professionals.
Our revenue for fiscal 2021 was $2.273 billion, approximately $414 million, or 18% which came from our TTEC Digital segment and $1.859 billion, or 82%, which came from our TTEC Engage segment. 
To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and to lead our clients with emerging CX methodologies, we continue to invest in innovation and service offerings for both mainstream and high-growth disruptive businesses, diversifying and strengthening our core customer care services with technology-enabled, outcomes-focused services, data analytics, insights, and consulting.

We also invest to broaden our product and service capabilities, increase our global client base and industry expertise, tailor our geographic footprint to the needs of our clients, and further scale our end-to-end integrated solutions platform. To this end we have been highly acquisitive in the last several years, including recently agreeing to acquire certain citizen experience assets of Faneuil, Inc. that include healthcare exchange and transportation services contracts, expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. This acquisition, once closed, will expand our capabilities in the growing public sector market deploying investments to achieve technology-enabled citizen engagement solutions. We also completed an acquisition early in the second quarter of 2021 of a provider of Genesys and Microsoft cloud contact center services, which followed an acquisition in the second half of 2020 of a preferred Amazon Connect cloud contact center service provider and an acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 of an autonomous customer experience and intelligent automation solutions provider. In the previous year, we completed an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019 of a provider of customer care, social media community management, content moderation, technical support, and business process solutions for rapidly growing businesses in early stages of their lifecycle.
We have extensive expertise in the automotive, communications, financial services, national/federal and state and local government, healthcare, logistics, media and entertainment, e-tail/retail, technology, travel and transportation industries. We serve more than 750 diverse clients globally, including many of the world’s iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and disruptive hypergrowth companies.
Cybersecurity Incident
In September 2021, TTEC experienced a ransomware incident that temporarily disrupted the Engage business segment’s client support environment. Certain TTEC systems and data became encrypted and certain TTEC data was exfiltrated or destroyed. TTEC Digital business segment’s information systems and client environment were not involved in the attack. TTEC activated its incident response and business continuity protocols, notified law enforcement, took appropriate measures to restore its systems and was able to restore operations for many impacted clients within hours of the start of the incident, with all client-facing systems returning to operations within five days of the incident.
We exercised reasonable efforts to identify data that may have been exfiltrated. We continue to monitor the situation, and we are not currently aware of evidence that exfiltrated data was publicly released. As of the date of this report, data involved in the incident has been analyzed for impact and notice obligations, and we provided appropriate regulatory and individual notices about the incident and its potential impacts.
With support from outside forensic experts, TTEC completed its investigation of root causes and impacts of the cybersecurity incident and is working to harden the security of its information technology environment and is taking measures to move to a ‘zero trust’ environment to protect its systems and its data. 
The Company performed appropriate procedures to validate the accuracy and completeness of information involved in its financial reporting, and we have no indication that the accuracy and completeness of any financial information was impacted as a result of the incident.
The temporary operational disruptions that occurred due to this incident did not have a long-term impact on our results of operations. We made additional investments in the hardening of our cybersecurity environment and the operational governance of our information technology systems during the fourth quarter of 2021 and expect to make further investments in 2022. While the total amount of likely investment has not yet been determined, we anticipate that it will be at least $6 million in 2022 and beyond. The incident and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy laws in connection with this incident could result in government enforcement actions, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties, and private legal actions, which could impact our results of operations and expenses associated with the incident. In the first quarter of 2022, we have been served with certain lawsuits alleging data privacy failures, which are typical when cybersecurity incidents result in data exfiltration. Other actual and potential consequences of the incident may include negative publicity, loss of client trust, reputational damage, litigation, contractual claims, financial judgement or settlements in excess of insurance, and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage. See, Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.

COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Early in second quarter of 2020, we transitioned approximately 80% of our employee population to a work from home environment. Those employees who were considered essential and could not operate effectively while working remotely, continued to work in our brick-and-mortar sites consistent with the recommendations on health and safety from the World Health Organization, the U.S. and European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local government regulations in jurisdictions where our customer experience centers are located. As of the time of this disclosure, most TTEC employees continue to work from home, and we continue to evaluate when and to what extent they will return to our offices and customer experience centers. During 2021, we also took pro-active steps to ensure that TTEC was prepared to comply with relevant vaccination mandates and other safety measures in jurisdictions where we do business.
Our implementation of business continuity plans, rapid transition of employees to a work from home environment, and the geographic diversification of our customer experience delivery centers allowed us to mitigate potentially more severe impacts of COVID-19, positioned us to continue supporting our commercial and public sector clients without interruptions and provide them with additional support as they experienced surge volumes of customer, patient, and citizen COVID-19 related engagement. 
Through the period ended December 31, 2021 the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operational or financial results. While we expect this positive trend to continue and some of our COVID-19 specific work has transitioned to more traditional business activities for the same clients, there continues to be uncertainty about our business as the pandemic continues around the globe, including the emergence of certain variant strains of the virus, and related business interruption; and as our clients plan for post-pandemic business realities including new ways of working, evolving use of technology, and inflationary pressures. We cannot accurately predict the severity of the economic and operational challenges of an on-going COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic changes on our clients’ businesses and their effect on the magnitude and timing of our clients’ buying decisions. Further, while to date we have been successful in managing service delivery from a highly disbursed employee population working remotely and our delivery sites that could not be replaced with work from home delivery, unpredictable business interruption decisions from government authorities in some jurisdictions where we do business, certain seasonal weather cycles and their potential impacts on power grid, and internet availability for our employees working from home may impact our delivery capability with little notice, thus potentially impacting our results of operations in the future.
Capital and Financing Availability
Our strong balance sheet, cash flow from operations and access to debt and capital markets have historically provided us the financial flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, incremental investments, and capital distributions. 
We return capital to our shareholders through our dividend program. Given our cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we believe cash dividends, in balance with our investments in product and service innovations, organic growth, and strategic acquisitions, align shareholder interests with the needs of the Company. After consideration of TTEC’s performance, cash flow from operations, capital needs and the overall liquidity of the Company, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy in 2015, with the intent to distribute a periodic cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock. Since inception in 2015, the Company has continued to pay a semi-annual dividend in October and April of each year in gradually increasing amounts from $0.18 per common share in 2015 to $0.47 per common share in October 2021. In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a special one-time dividend of $2.14 per common share. On February 24, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a semi-annual dividend of $0.50 per common share, payable on April 20, 2022 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2022.

Our Industry – Key Emerging Themes

● | Accelerated Digital and Virtual Transformation – Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading organizations were already transforming to a more digitized, virtualized future. The pandemic and related impacts on access to products and services and how organizations manage their customer interactions, exposed significant customer interaction technology and delivery deficiencies for many organizations across the world that were not digitized or agile enough to adequately support their customers. Organizations’ front-line operations and customer support infrastructure were too brick-and-mortar focused with limited non-voice digital customer interaction alternatives. Organizations are recognizing the growing importance of increased virtual delivery solutions and expanded and enhanced digital omnichannel capabilities. This development is expected to create accelerated demand for our demonstrated suite of CX product and service offerings to enable and support this transformation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) Revolution - The DTC revolution has created a new generation of disruptive brands with few barriers to entry. These emerging brands thrive on emotional connection and authentic customer relationships relying on trusted influencers and personalized service to win the hearts and minds of a growing customer base, one that requires an on-demand, curated buying experience. We believe DTC can enhance the value we provide to our clients as we design, build and operate our clients’ digital customer experience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evolution of Customer Behavior and CX Imperative - Yesterday's customer service experience is being replaced by today's direct experience, where brands deliver a personalized end-to-end journey. As customers become more connected and share their experiences across a variety of social channels, the quality of the experience has a greater impact on brand loyalty and business performance. Customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes, behaviors, and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand based on the totality of their experience, including not only the superiority of the product or service, but also the quality of their ongoing service and support interactions. Given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability, companies are increasingly focused on selecting partners who can deliver an integrated, insights-driven strategy, service, and technology solution that increases the lifetime value of a customer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CX Technology is Migrating to the Cloud - Cloud investment is expected to continue to grow significantly. The adoption of cloud technology to deliver omnichannel and other customer experience technology is still in its infancy. Our clients are embracing cloud-based CX technology solutions in a manner similar to how they seek cost-effective architecture and rapid deployment across other parts of their operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprises are Consolidating Partners - An increasing percentage of companies are consolidating their customer engagement wallet with a few select partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering an integrated, technology-enabled solution. Companies will continue to consolidate their business partner relationships, favoring companies like TTEC, that have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering holistic, integrated customer-centric solutions spanning the entire customer experience journey, instead of inefficiently linking together a series of multiple point solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Delivery Shifting from Brick-and-Mortar to Work From Home – COVID-19 accelerated the shift of customer experience delivery from brick-and-mortar to work from home. While we expect a portion of work from home delivery to shift back to brick-and-mortar post-pandemic, a higher portion of delivery will remain in work from home locations than pre-pandemic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
TTEC is an industry leader in CX by leveraging the following competitive strengths:

● | Humanify® Technology Platform and Insights-Driven Technology Solutions - Innovation has been a priority since our inception 40 years ago. Our dedication and investment in transforming our business has differentiated our solutions portfolio and increased the value we deliver to our clients across the CX continuum. Our Humanify® Technology Platform delivers an ecosystem of integrated CX applications, including omnichannel contact center platforms, the largest CRMs and ERPs, as well as innovative technology solutions that we fully integrate into our clients' broader technology systems. The platform is based on secure, scalable public and private data centers, in both pure cloud, on premise, and hybrid environments. This architecture enables us to centralize and standardize our global delivery capabilities, resulting in scalability and improved quality of delivery for our clients, as well as lowering capital and information technology operating costs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamental to our platforms is our network of global data centers, which provide an integrated suite of voice and data routing, workforce management, quality monitoring, business analytics, storage, and infrastructure security and fault-tolerance capabilities, enabling seamless operations from locations around the globe. This ‘hub and spoke model’ enables us to provide services at a competitive cost while delivering scalability, reliability, regulatory compliance, and asset utilization across the full suite of our service offerings. It also provides effective redundancy for a timely response to system interruptions and outages due to natural disasters, grid downtime, and other conditions outside of our control. Importantly, this broad-based platform has accelerated our time to market foundation for new, innovative offerings such as TTEC's cloud based Humanify® Operations/Insights Platform, Humanify® @Home for remote omnichannel agents, and our suite of human capital solutions.
Further, our Humanify® Technology Platforms leverage reference architectures for multiple solutions whether we are operating the platforms and the services, implementing customized platforms for clients, or providing advanced managed services and continuous and automated development environments. They also provide clients with compliant solutions for regional (e.g., the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) or the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”)), industry (e.g., the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI”), or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HITRUST”)), or client specific standards (e.g., FedRamp or FISMA).

● | Innovative Human Capital Strategies – Our global, highly trained employee base is crucial to the success of our business. We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies and management tools, methodologies, and training processes in the areas of virtual and non-virtual talent acquisition, learning services, knowledge management, workforce engagement and collaboration and performance optimization. These capabilities are the culmination of four decades of experience in managing a large, global workforce combined with the latest technology, innovation and strategies in the field of human capital management. This capability has enabled us to deliver a scalable and flexible workforce that is highly engaged in achieving and exceeding our clients' expectations.

Clients
We develop long-term relationships with clients globally, including many of the worlds’ iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and hypergrowth companies. These organizations are in customer intensive industries or sectors, whose complexities and customer focus require a partner that can quickly design and build integrated technology and data-enabled services, often on a global scale. In 2021, our top five and 10 clients represented 38% and 49% of total revenue, respectively. 
In several of our offerings across TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage, we enter into long-term relationships that provide us with a more predictable recurring revenue stream. In our TTEC Digital segment, our CX cloud and managed services technology solution contracts have an average three-year term with penalties in the case a client terminates for convenience. In our TTEC Engage segment, most of our contracts can be terminated for convenience by either party, but our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from 15 to 22 years including multiple programs and contract renewals for several of these clients. In 2021, we had a 109% revenue retention rate for the TTEC Engage segment, versus 111% in 2020.
Certain of our communications clients provide us with telecommunication services through arm’s length negotiated transactions. These clients currently represent approximately 6% of our total annual revenue. Expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than 1% of our total operating costs.
Competition
We are a leading global customer experience technology and services partner for many of the world’s most iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and hypergrowth companies. Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, digital and virtual delivery capabilities, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand recognition, and financial strength.
Our strategy in maintaining market leadership is to invest, innovate, and provide integrated value-driven services, all centered around customer engagement management. Today, we are executing on a more expansive, holistic strategy by transforming our business into higher-value offerings through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As we execute, we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and entering new markets that introduce us to an expanded competitive landscape.
In our TTEC Digital segment, we primarily compete with smaller pure-play technology and service providers and divisions of multinational companies, including Five9, LivePerson, InContact, Twilio, EPAM, Endava, Globant, GlobalLogic, Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, among others.
In our TTEC Engage segment, we primarily compete with in-house customer management operations as well as other companies that provide customer care services including: Teleperformance, Telus International, Concentrix, TaskUs, 24-7 Intouch, Webhelp, Accenture, Genpact, Exl, among others.
Regulations Relevant to Our Business
TTEC is subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations and permitting and licensing regimes (“Regulations”). These Regulations often change and require TTEC to devote resources and make investments to stay in consistent compliance. The narrative that follows summarizes some of the more important Regulations that impact our business; it is not intended as an all-inclusive list. In every jurisdiction where we do business, TTEC has processes in place to monitor regulatory requirements and take reasonable steps to assure compliance. 
Data Privacy. We are subject to data protection and privacy regulations in many of the countries where we operate, including the European General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA") and other similar U.S. state-level data protection legislation, the Philippine Data Privacy Act (“Republic Act No. 10173”). Certain of our customer experience centers and remote locations also require compliance with Health Information Trust Alliance (“HITRUST”) requirements, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”,) and with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), and other similar requirements. 

7



TTEC maintains a cyber security and data privacy program designed to protect our clients’, their customers’, and our employees’ confidential personal and sensitive information. We have invested in our cyber security capabilities to identify, detect, respond to and recover from cyber threats and attacks. These investments help us reduce our vulnerabilities to cyber incidents and minimize their impacts on our operations. They also support compliance with our contractual obligations and the laws and regulations governing our activities. We engage independent auditors to conduct general controls and business process (SOC1 and SOC2) assessments for technology solutions we use in our banking, financial services, and insurance (“BFSI”) and healthcare verticals. We also engage third parties to conduct vulnerability assessment and penetration testing of our technology environments. See "Risk Factors — Uncertainty and inconsistency in privacy and data protection laws that impact our business, failure to comply with contractual obligations related to privacy, and high cost of compliance may impact our ability to deliver services and our results of operations.”
Work From Home Regulations. The transition to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to new Regulations specific to work from home, which vary among jurisdictions and range from requirements to reimburse costs associated with remote work, to special health and safety mandates, and special government reporting requirements. To comply with these Regulations, TTEC updated its payroll practices and adopted new ways of working, including the use of secure virtual private networks to access service delivery applications, and remote monitoring and coaching of employees. As we were not always able to replicate in the work from home environment the physical controls we have in place at our customer experience centers, we agreed with our clients to implement certain additional controls. Employees that work from home are required to attest to their understanding and compliance with these controls and with TTEC’s enhanced telecommuter policy that is designed to address new Regulations and the modified contractual requirements. TTEC works diligently with specialists to stay current on the rapidly changing regulatory environment, but the distributed nature of remote service delivery continues to represent heightened risks of security threats and compliance challenges and there can be no assurance that these risks can be fully contained. See "Risk Factors — As our work from home delivery grows, our operations are subject to new untested risks.”
Other Regulations. TTEC is a labor-intensive business that is subject to complex labor and employment laws established by the U.S. Department of Labor, state and local regulatory bodies, and similar regulators in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. These Regulations govern working conditions, paid time off, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices. 
Our global operations are subject to various domestic and foreign anti-corruption mandates, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions where we do business. As a U.S. company operating through non-U.S. subsidiaries, TTEC is subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing, cross-border tax Regulations, immigration and customs Regulations that prescribe how funds, goods, and people traverse between TTEC and our foreign subsidiaries. See "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our International Operations.”
We believe that our operations are in compliance with relevant Regulations; but our compliance with Regulations may cause us to make additional capital and operational expenditures, the cost of which we may not always be able to pass to our clients through our pricing structures, and such additional investments could be material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See "Risk Factors — Our results of operations may be impacted by changes in laws, our failure to comply with laws and regulations relevant to our business.”
Research, Innovation, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
We recognize the value of innovation in our business and are committed to developing leading-edge technologies and proprietary solutions. Research and innovation have been a major factor in our success and we believe that they will continue to contribute to our growth in the future. We use our investment in research and development to create, commercialize, and deploy innovative business strategies and high-value technology solutions.
We deliver value to our clients through, and our success in part depends on, certain proprietary technologies and methodologies. We leverage U.S. and foreign patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws as well as confidentiality, proprietary information, non-disclosure agreements, and key staff non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary technology.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 13 patent applications pending; and also hold 99 U.S. and non-U.S. patents in 11 jurisdictions that we leverage in our operations and as marketplace differentiation for our service offerings. Our trade name, logos, and names of our proprietary solution offerings are protected by their historic use and, in addition, by trademarks and service marks registered in 21 jurisdictions.
Human Capital Resources
Headcount Information: As of December 31, 2021, TTEC had 65,000 employees, approximately 2,600 of whom are CX professionals serving TTEC Digital clients and approximately 62,400 of whom serve TTEC Engage clients. Approximately 44% of our employees are based in the Asia-Pacific region, 45% in North America (with 43% in the United States), 8% in Central and South America, and 3% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.
Development and Training:  Our 2021 Human Experience (HX) people strategy is focused on the attraction, development and retention of our employees through meaningful engagement and purposeful development. To support advancement of our employees and prepare them for demands of rapidly changing workplace and client requirements we offer career development focused programs, technologies, and resources. In 2021 we made significant investments in learning technologies and courseware, including a new talent management platform, TTEC Talenttm, that provides a streamlined and enhanced career management experience by combining learning, performance management and talent development into one platform. TTEC Talenttm houses a library of more than 10,000 courses that cover topics on general business acumen ranging from business operations, professionalism, leadership, ethics, finance, negotiations, and project management to subject-matter specific professional and technical curriculum. TTEC development programs help identify top performers, improve employee performance, engagement, and retention, and create promotion-from-within opportunities in the Company with 70% of our open positions filled by internal candidates in 2021.
Our Pay-for-Performance philosophy is fueled by ensuring employees receive ongoing regular coaching and development, and through TTEC Talenttm 95% of eligible employees completed check-ins with their manager focused on goals, priorities, and personal development on a quarterly basis.
Talent planning for executive roles is accomplished through a talent review and succession planning process. We evaluate all mid-level managers and above roles, determine top talent and successors and invest in their development to meet our growth goals. 
In 2021, TTEC launched the second cohort of employees as part of our Talent Accelerator Program (“TAP”) and Leadership Development Internship program. The TAP program, originally launched in 2020, is designed to identify and attract new talent and prepare them for success within our organization. Each year the program recruits recently graduated candidates with diverse backgrounds in various fields relevant to TTEC ranging from technology to humanities who undergo a two-year rotational training through business functions and business segments. Our TAP program participants gain experience in finance, risk, human capital, IT, communications, marketing, sales, and operations, becoming fully immersed in the day-to-day operations of the Company. Once the program is completed, the TAP participants will be equipped with knowledge and experience necessary to progress as a manager in the Company.

Diversity & Inclusion: TTEC believes that our culture of diversity and inclusion enables us to create, develop and leverage the strengths of our employee population to align with our client expectations and enable the Company’s growth objectives. To advance our diversity and inclusion objectives, TTEC formed the Diversity Council that combines representatives from different business segments and geographies who bring a diverse mix of backgrounds and perspectives. The Diversity Council includes special affinity groups such as Women in Leadership and Black Leadership Council to help unify us and make us stronger as one team. Our Diversity Council is a critical driver in fostering organizational change, establishing a dedicated focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion priorities identifying best practices and new opportunities, increasing awareness and education, providing leadership opportunities within TTEC to traditionally underrepresented employees, as well as holding the organization accountable in driving a culture that realizes TTEC’s vision of ‘bringing humanity to business’. The Company has adopted several metrics that focus on ensuring accountability for progress in diversity. The CEO, members of TTEC executive leadership team and other senior leaders have diversity and inclusion objectives embedded in their annual performance goals. As of December 31, 2021, 59% of the Company’s global workforce was female and 52% of employees in supervisory roles were female; 54% of the U.S. workforce were people of color and 37% of employees in supervisory roles were people of color.
Competitive Pay/Benefits and Pay-for-Performance Philosophy:  Our pay-for-performance philosophy aligns our compensation with TTEC’s performance and with the returns that our stockholders receive from their investment in the Company. TTEC compensation programs are designed to provide appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve desired outcomes for our clients and our shareholders. Further, TTEC provides employees with a comprehensive benefits program that includes health insurance and important wellness programs, including nicotine abatement and mental health initiatives, as well as other programs that support employees’ physical, emotional, and financial health.
Workplace Safety:  The health and safety of our employees is one of our top priorities. TTEC’s success depends on protecting our employees, visitors, clients and facilities, and our goal is to provide everyone that works for us and with us, a safe and healthy work environment. TTEC employees are required to complete health and safety training when they join the Company and are encouraged to report any concerns they have about health and safety in their work environment. 
In 2020 we had to change how we work to address the COVID-19 pandemic and we took measures to transition most of our employees to a work from home environment. This arrangement continued through 2021. For sites that provided essential services and had to remain operational during the pandemic, we enhanced sanitation and safety protocols including increased cleaning frequency, additional signage, workstation reconfiguration for social distancing, personal protective equipment, contact tracing, shuttle services, and automated health attestations. During 2021 we also took pro-active steps to ensure that TTEC was prepared to comply with relevant vaccination mandates in jurisdictions where we do business. 
Retention and Turnover: Since TTEC business is people intensive, retention and reduction in turnover is a priority important to the financial results of our operations. Our turnover reduction efforts focus on market pay, trained management teams, development programs, career mobility, communication and the work environment and company culture that make an employee feel engaged, rewarded, appreciated, informed, and fulfilled in the organization.
Employee Engagement: We continuously assess employee engagement by gathering employees’ sentiment (from frequent pulse surveys to annual engagement and eNPS surveys) that allow us to measure employee satisfaction, loyalty and measure our employees rational and emotional engagement with the organization. In 2021, about 35,000 of our employees responded to our annual engagement surveys. Based on these surveys our employee engagement ratings exceed Gallup's best-in-class engagement scores.
