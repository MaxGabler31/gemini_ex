ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 OVERVIEW
  
 Exeo Entertainment, Inc. (the “Company” “we” or “us”) designs, develops, licenses, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics in the video gaming, music and smart TV sector. Our current business objectives are:

· | Complete product development and establish channels of distribution, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Expand SKUs within the headphone market for both music and gaming 


 
  Activities to date
  
 We incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 12, 2011. We are a development stage company. From our inception to date we have generated minimal revenues and continue to operate at a loss. Our activities have centered on the design and engineering of peripherals in the video gaming, music, and smart TV sector.
  
 We accomplished the following:
  
 
1) | We completed the molds for the Psyko™ PC model and are working on the molds for the Psyko™ console unit. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | During the six months ending May 31, 2015, we received inventory of the Krankz™ Bluetooth Wireless Headsets, and the Psyko®5.1 Surround Sound Gaming Headsets (with built-in microphone) with external amplifier for Personal Computers. We also approved the working prototypes of the similar type of Psyko® Krypton headphones for use with gaming consoles (such as Xbox®), and the Company is ready to go forward with the manufacturing.

 Products and Services
  
 Products under development include the Psyko™ 5.1 surround sound gaming headphones for consoles, Krankz™ MAXX Bluetooth™ wireless headphones

  Psyko® Krypton™ Surround Sound Headphones
  
 
 While our Psyko® headphone offering differs from the competition in the method of 5.1-surround sound delivery, we will face competition from manufacturers with established channels of distribution, mature capital structures, and significantly larger marketing budgets. Well established gaming headphone manufacturers include Turtle Beach; a private company, Tritton – a subsidiary of Mad Catz Interactive (MCZ), and Astro Gaming which is a subsidiary of Skullcandy (SKUL).
  
 While other headphone manufacturers replicate 5.1 surround sound through Digital Signal Processing (DSP), the Psyko® headphones use a patented method of sound delivery that does not require the use of DSP. Management believes that the difference in audio quality is a major differentiating factor between our product offering and what is currently available on the market.
  
 
  Krankz™ Headphones
  
 The driver design provides a deep bass sound with clear midrange audio for a full-range for use up to 30’ distance.  These headsets work with most mobile devices and have a retractable, foldable design with built-in microphone and noise cancelling feature. We expect to face competition from lifestyle headphone companies such as Beats by Dr. Dre and Skull candy. These entities are well established and have a loyal customer following. We expect to carve out a niche within the market by initially marketing to the X games demographic through endorsements and sponsorships in Extreme sports such as motocross, supercross, snowboarding, surfing, skating, and similar such sports.

 Currently, we are working on slight changes in the design of the Krankz Headphones. We are also, working with Vegas Golden Knights NHL team and have designed a custom Krankz Headphone for them. This is part of the sponsorship agreement we entered into during 2018.
  
  Strategy and Marketing Plan
  
  Manufacturing is established, so we intend on utilizing existing consumer electronics distributers, such as Synnex Corp. (SNX) and Ingram Micro to distribute our products to big box retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop, and Fry’s Electronics. We do not have distribution agreements with these companies at this time.
 Distributor Agreement
  
 We have an “Exclusive Distributor” Agreement with Axcel Electronics Thailand Company Limited (Cableicons, Inc.) which covers the USA and Canada to Distribute and sell the “Ford Officially Licensed Cell Phone Accessories” in all wholesale and retail channels. Here is the link for the online Ford Officially Licensed Cell Phone Accessories Catalog. https://bit.ly/2Qo1eom
  
  Sources and Availability of Suppliers and Supplies
  
 Currently we have access to an adequate supply of products, from various manufacturers.  These companies and their products are new, not well established, and are a subject to significant risk and uncertainty.

  Dependence on One or a few Major Customers
  
 We do not anticipate dependence on one or a few major customers into the foreseeable future.
  
  Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations and Concessions
  
 We executed a license agreement with Psyko Audio Labs Canada to manufacture and distribute the Carbon and Krypton line of patented headphones. US Patent # 8,000,486 (for the Psyko Krypton™ surround sound gaming headphones.)  With regard to intellectual property rights associated with Psyko® Headphones, we have a license to use this mark as well as the patented technology.
  
 We entered into a license agreement with Digital Extreme Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (also referred to as DXT) for use of certain intellectual property associated with the products being designed and developed by us. The Black Widow keyboard is now known as the Zaaz keyboard. DXT worked to design and develop the Extreme Gamer as well as the Black Widow keyboard. We continue to work under a license agreement with DXT to advance the use of technologies designed by DXT. There is no licensing fee paid to DXT during the years ended November 30, 2014 and 2015
  
 DXT applied to the U.S. PTO for a patent of its Multi Video Game Changer. The agency assigned an application number of 12/543,296 to its application, which was published on February 25, 2010. The proposed 10 disk Video Game Changer is designed to interface directly with Sony PS3®, Nintendo Wii®, and Microsoft Xbox 360®. The Company anticipates incorporating Blu-Ray® compatible optics technology under a license agreement. This would allow users to insert Blu-Ray® discs into the Video Game Changer, and once connected to the video game console, to play movies on television. Sony PS3® is now capable of playing Blu-Ray® discs, but only with a capacity for a single disk. This technology would provide for the loading of up to 10 DVD’s, CD’s or Blu-Ray® discs into a single console that communicates with a video game console via USB. Furthermore, users would be able to plug in any external hard disc drive (“HDD”) directly into the console via an internal ATPI port, allowing movies, music and pictures to be played directly from the HDD.
  
 In regard to intellectual property rights associated with Krankz™ Bluetooth® wireless headphones, we do not have a federally registered trademark as to the word marks Krankz or Krankz Maxx. Therefore, we do not have the same presumptive rights which might otherwise apply had we obtained a federally registered trademark.  We believe we have intellectual property rights to this mark under common law.  If we are unable to register this mark, we may use an alternative name for these headphones.
  
  Sponsorship Agreement
  
 On July 13, 2018, the Company entered into a sponsorship agreement for headphones with Black Knight Sports and Entertainment, LLC (dba Vegas Golden Knights)(“BKSE”) for a period through June 2021. During the first NHL season, the Company was obligated to pay $230,000. For the second NHL season, the Company is obligated to pay $239,200 and for the third NHL season, the Company is obligated to pay $248,768. If the team does into playoffs there could be additional fees due.
 Subsidiaries
  
 We do not have any subsidiaries.
