Item 1. Business
Company Background
 
Primo Water Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Primo,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”) is North America’s leading single source provider of multi-gallon purified bottled water, self-service refill drinking water and water dispensers sold through major retailers in the United States and Canada. We are a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2017 in connection with the creation of a holding company structure. Our predecessor was founded in Delaware in 2004.
 
On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition by merger (the “Acquisition”) of Glacier Water Services, Inc. (“Glacier”), the leading provider of high-quality drinking water dispensed to consumers through self-service water machines located at over 20,000 locations, including supermarkets and other retail locations. The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated October 9, 2016.
 
Our business is designed to generate recurring demand for our purified bottled water or self-service refill drinking water through the sale of innovative water dispensers (“Dispensers”). This business strategy is commonly referred to as “razor-razorblade” because the initial sale of a product creates a base of users who frequently purchase complementary consumable products. Once our bottled water is consumed using a water dispenser, empty bottles are exchanged at our recycling center displays, which provide a recycling ticket that offers a discount toward the purchase of a new bottle of Primo purified water (“Exchange”) or they are refilled at a self-service refill drinking water location (“Refill”). Each of our multi-gallon Exchange water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to 40 times before being taken out of use, crushed and recycled, substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of equivalent volumes of single-serve bottled water. As of December 31, 2018, our products were offered in the United States and in Canada at over 45,000 combined retail locations, including Walmart, Lowe’s Home Improvement, Sam’s Club, The Home Depot, Meijer, Kroger, Food Lion, H-E-B Grocery, Circle K, Family Dollar, Walgreens, Albertsons, Publix, and CVS. We believe the market for purified and refill drinking water continues to grow due to evolving taste preferences, perceived health benefits and concerns regarding the quality of municipal tap water. Our products provide an environmentally friendly, economical, convenient and healthy solution for consuming purified and filtered water.

We provide major retailers throughout the United States and Canada with a single-vendor solution for our three reporting segments (Refill, Exchange, and Dispensers) addressing a market demand that we believe was previously unmet. Our solutions are easy for retailers to implement, require minimal management supervision and store-based labor, and provide centralized billing and detailed performance reports. Exchange offers retailers attractive financial margins and the ability to optimize typically unused retail space with our displays.  Refill provides drinking water for consumer purchase through the installation of self-service vending displays at retail locations. The Refill business model eliminates the bottling and distribution infrastructure required to deliver traditional bottled water, thereby allowing us to provide refill drinking water at a valuable price as compared to alternatives in the marketplace. Additionally, due to the recurring nature of water consumption, retailers benefit from year-round customer traffic, highly predictable revenue and health and wellness focused consumers.
 
Business Segments

We have three operating segments and three reportable segments: Refill, Exchange, and Dispensers. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 15 – Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein.
Industry Overview
 
We believe there are several trends that support consumer demand for Refill, Exchange and Dispensers including the following:
 
Emphasis on Health and Wellness. As part of a desire to live a healthier lifestyle, we believe consumers are increasingly focused on drinking greater quantities of water compared to carbonated beverages and other high calorie drinks.
Concerns Regarding Quality of Municipal Tap Water. Many consumers purchase bottled water because of concerns regarding municipal tap water quality. Municipal water is typically surface water that is treated centrally and pumped to homes, which can allow chemical and microbiological contaminants to dissolve into the water through municipal or household pipes, impacting taste and quality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that local U.S. governments will be required to spend over $300 billion to repair water and sewer pipes over the next decade.
Growing Preference for Purified Water. We believe consumer preference toward purified water relative to tap water continues to grow as purified water has become accepted on a mainstream basis. While it is difficult to quantify purified water consumption in all of its forms, according to a 2017 report by industry consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corp. (“BMC”), wholesale spending on bottled water was almost $16.2 billion in 2016, up from $14.7 billion and $13.4 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The BMC also reported that global bottled water consumption has grown to 92.1 billion gallons in 2016 from 19.2 billion in 1996. Additionally, growth in spending on bottled water between 2012 and 2017 significantly exceeded spending growth in other beverage categories in the same period.
Increasing Demand for Products with Lower Environmental Impact. We believe that consumers are increasingly favoring products with a lower environmental impact with a “reuse, recycle, reduce” mindset becoming a common driver of consumer behavior. Most single-serve water bottles are produced using fossil fuels and contribute to landfill waste given that only 29.3% of single-serve bottles are recycled according to a December 2018 report issued for 2017 by The Association of Plastic Recyclers. Legislation also reflects these concerns with the passage of “bottle bills” in many jurisdictions that tax the purchase of plastic water bottles, require deposits with the purchase of certain plastic bottles, prohibit the use of government funds to purchase plastic water bottles and ban certain plastic bottles from landfills.
Availability of an Economical Exchange Solution, Refill Solution and Innovative Water Dispensers. We believe the vast majority of U.S. households utilize traditional home delivery services for water dispensers, which generally lack innovation, design enhancement, and functionality. These factors, combined with the retail pricing structure of our competitors’ dispenser models, have prevented greater household adoption of these dispensers. Compounding these issues, we believe there previously was no economical water bottle exchange and refill solution with major retailers throughout the United States and Canada to promote dispenser usage beyond the traditional home delivery model. We believe our Exchange and Refill solutions provide this alternative and we believe we are currently the only provider delivering a single-vendor solution to retailers throughout the United States and Canada. We believe there are over 50,000 additional major retail locations throughout the United States and Canada that we can target to sell our Refill, Exchange and Dispensers products.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that Primo’s competitive strengths include the following:
 
Appeal to Consumer Preferences


● | Health and Wellness. As part of a desire to live a healthier lifestyle, we believe that consumers are increasingly focused on drinking more water relative to other beverages and a recent study has shown that bulk water purchasers drink more water. As we raise our brand awareness, we believe consumers will recognize that our Water products are a convenient option for their water consumption needs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Value. We provide consumers the opportunity for cost savings when consuming our bottled water compared to other forms of pre-filled one-gallon bottles, single-serve bottled water and typical home and office delivery services. Additionally, our water dispensers are sold at attractive retail prices in order to enhance consumer awareness and adoption of our Refill and Exchange (“Water”) products, increase household penetration and drive sales of our purified and refill drinking water.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Taste. We have dedicated significant time and effort to develop our water purification process and formulate the proprietary blend of mineral ingredients included in our Primo purified water offered through Exchange. We believe that Primo purified water has a silky smooth taste profile.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Convenience. Both our Water and Dispensers products are available at major retail locations in the United States and Canada that are part of everyday shopping trips. In addition, our Water products and services provide consumers the convenience of either exchanging empty bottles and purchasing full bottles or refilling the empty bottles at any participating retailer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dispenser Innovation and Design. We strive to develop dispensers that fit our customers’ lifestyles and décor. For example, Primo’s hTRIO Water Dispenser brews K-cup® beverages and delivers cold and hot water on demand – integrating multiple kitchen appliances into one space-saving design. With our Water Dispenser with Pet Station, the entire family including pets can enjoy the delicious taste of Primo®.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Environmental Awareness. Our Refill and Exchange segments promote the reuse of existing bottles, recycling of water bottles when their lifecycle is complete and reduction of landfill waste and fossil fuel usage compared to alternative methods of bottled water consumption.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Retail Relationships Served by a Single-Vendor Solution. We are the only single-vendor solution of Water products for retailers in the United States and Canada. Our direct sales force actively pursues headquarters-based retail relationships to minimize layers of approval and decision-making with regard to the addition of new retail locations. We believe the combination of our major retail relationships, regional territory coverage, unique single-vendor solution for retail customers and our bottling and distribution network is difficult to replicate. We anticipate these factors will facilitate our ability to introduce new purified water-related products in the future.
 
Ability to Attract and Retain Consumers. We offer “razor-razorblade” products designed to generate recurring demand for our Water products (the razorblade) through the initial sale of our innovative Dispensers (the razor), which often include a coupon for a free multi-gallon bottle of our Exchange or Refill water. We acquire new consumers and enhance recycling efforts by accepting most dispenser-compatible empty water bottles in exchange for a recycle ticket discount toward the purchase of a full bottle of Primo purified water. In addition, we believe our offering of high-quality water dispensers enhances consumer awareness and adoption of our Water products, increases household penetration and drives sales of our Water products.

Efficient Business Model. Our business model allows us to efficiently offer our solutions to our retail partners and centrally manage our bottling, distribution and field service networks. We believe our business processes enable us to manage (i) the bottling and distribution of our Exchange products, (ii) our product quality, (iii) retailer inventory levels and (iv) company field service network in Refill on a centralized basis, leveraging our invested capital and personnel.

Successful Acquisition Integration and Leading Platform of Scale. In December 2016, we completed the acquisition of Glacier Water Services, Inc., a leading provider of high-quality refill drinking water dispensed to consumers through self-service water machines located at over 20,000 locations, including supermarkets and other retail locations. The Glacier acquisition has created a platform of scale for our Refill business, enabling additional direct interaction with consumers, adding and strengthening our relationships with key retailers and diversifying our sales across customers and channels. Our successful integration of the Glacier business has delivered cost savings and synergies that have exceeded initial targets, and we continue to optimize the combined business for additional benefits.
Benefit from Management’s and Board’s Proven Track Record. We benefit greatly from management experience gained over the last 23 years at Primo and in other exchange businesses to implement and refine best practices and develop and maintain key business relationships. Billy D. Prim, our former Chief Executive Officer and current Executive Chairman, served as Chief Executive Officer of Blue Rhino Corporation, another company with a “razor/razorblade” business model that provided propane cylinder exchange and complementary propane and non-propane products, from March 1994 until its acquisition in 2004. In addition to our Executive Chairman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew T. Sheehan, who joined Primo in December 2012, was previously employed by Coinstar, Inc. where he was instrumental in building the Redbox DVD exchange business.
Growth Strategy

We seek to increase our market share and drive further growth in our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 
Drive Consumer Adoption Through Innovative Water Dispenser Models. We intend to continue to develop and sell innovative Dispenser products at attractive retail prices, which we believe is critical to increasing consumer awareness and driving consumer adoption of our Water products. At December 31, 2018, we offered our water dispensers at approximately 7,300 locations in the United States and Canada, including Walmart, Lowes Home Improvement, Sam’s Club, Home Depot and Kroger. We also have distribution through leading online retailers including Amazon.com, Wayfair.com and our own Primowater.com site, as well as the websites of major retailers in the United States.
Increase Same Store Sales. We sell our Dispenser products at a low margin and often provide a coupon for a free multi-gallon bottle of our water at certain retailers to drive consumer demand for our Water products. We believe increasing unit sales of our Water products is dependent on generating greater consumer awareness of challenges with today’s tap water quality and the environmentally friendly and economical aspects of as well as the convenience associated with our Water products. We expect that our branding, cross-promotion marketing and sales efforts, enhanced by recently commenced strategic marketing and brand activation initiatives, including deployment at better points of purchase signage, increasing our paid media, social and digital presence, and piloting instantly redeemable coupons, will result in greater usage of our Water products.
Increase Penetration with Existing Retail Relationships and Develop New Retail Relationships. We believe we have significant opportunities to increase store penetration with our existing retail relationships. As of December 31, 2018, our Exchange Water was offered at approximately 13,200 combined retail locations, and our Refill products were offered in approximately 24,600 locations, including over 20,000 locations added in connection with the Glacier acquisition. There is virtually no overlap of historical Primo and historical Glacier refill locations, diversifying our retailer base and thereby reducing our concentration with our largest retailers. In addition, we believe that the Acquisition continues to provide the opportunity to place our Exchange and Dispensers products within new retailers.
 
We expect to continue to increase our retail store locations (which includes new locations with our existing retail customers) within our primary retail categories of home centers, convenience stores, hardware stores, mass merchants, membership warehouses, grocery stores, office supply stores, drug stores and discount general merchandise stores.
 
 7


Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and other Partnerships to Augment Geographic and Retail Relationships. Assuming we have available adequate capital resources, we believe opportunities exist to expand through selective strategic acquisitions, including (i) other on-premises self-service water refill machine networks and retail accounts, (ii) water bottle exchange businesses with established retail accounts and (iii) water dispenser or other beverage-related appliance companies. We also intend to explore strategic partnerships with established distributed, operators and other partners, particularly in international markets, to expand our operations. In January 2019, we entered into an agreement with a Mexico partner creating the framework for establishing a business in Mexico to sell reverse-osmosis water through indoor and outdoor self-service refill drinking water machines. We will provide the Mexico partner our expertise in refill through the license of certain of our intellectual property and know-how and the supply of self-service refill drinking water machines.
Product Overview

Refill. Our Refill solution consists of a carbon filtration and a reverse osmosis water filtration system that provides refill drinking water, which is routinely tested for quality. All federal, state and industry standards related to our refill drinking water are met or exceeded. At a portion of our Refill locations, we offer empty reusable one-, two-, three- and five-gallon bottles that typically accompany our self-service refill drinking water display, which are sourced from several manufacturers.
Exchange. We have dedicated significant time and effort in developing our water purification process and formulating the proprietary blend of mineral ingredients included in the purified bottled water offered through Exchange. Our proprietary blend of mineral ingredients was developed with the assistance of consultants and several months of lab work and taste tests. To ensure that our safety standards are met and United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and industry standards are met or exceeded, each production lot of our purified water undergoes chemical and microbiological testing by the bottler and all facilities bottling Primo purified water undergo regular hygiene audits. We currently source three- and five-gallon water bottles from several manufacturers for use in Exchange. Each of our Primo water bottles includes a handle designed for easy transportation and lifting when installing the bottle onto or into one of our water dispensers.
 
Dispensers. We currently source and market water dispensers comprised of 50 models and 7 accessory items. Our dispensers are designed to dispense Primo and other dispenser-compatible bottled water. Our dispensers have manufacturer suggested retail prices that range from $299.99 for our top-of-the-line bottom-loading model with a coffee maker to $9.99 for a simple, manually operated pump that can be installed on a bottle and operated without electricity. Currently, the majority of our Dispensers sales are attributable to our bottom- and top-loading products. Consistent with our environmental focus, our electric dispensers are Energy Star® rated, and, we believe, utilize less energy than competing water dispensers without this industry rating. Currently, we contract with independent suppliers for the design and manufacture of our water dispensers and are closely involved in the design and innovation process.
 
Primo Water Marketing

Our marketing efforts focus on developing a unified brand identity synonymous with a healthy, economical, convenient and environmentally friendly solution for purified and refill water consumption. In furtherance of this goal, in the third quarter of 2018, we announced our plan to move forward with a unified Primo brand in Refill and discontinue the Glacier brand (the “Brand Unification”), which we currently expect to complete by the end of 2020. We expect the Brand Unification to streamline our marketing and brand activation efforts while focusing our resources and management’s attention on a single brand.
 
Focusing on development and implementation of advanced marketing and brand activation strategies through new display advertising, television, print and radio marketing, social media and email communications, among others, is one of our key strategic initiatives in the near- and long-term future. We direct our marketing efforts as close as possible to the point of purchase including in-store, online and word-of-mouth to strengthen our brand and promote consumer awareness of our products. We believe our innovative dispensers combined with Exchange develops consumer loyalty through the use of our recycling tickets, while Refill develops consumer loyalty through value-oriented pricing. Our marketing efforts include the following initiatives: (i) driving awareness activities online through social media conversations and posts; (ii) prominent display of our various brand logos and designs on water bottles, sales and recycling displays and water dispensers; (iii) highly visible sales and recycling center displays; and (iv) regular cross-marketing promotions between our dispensers and our water including instant redeemable coupon which is a coupon on the outside of all of our dispenser packages that allows consumers to receive a free Exchange bottle of water when purchased with a Primo dispenser.

The Primo Supply Chain

Refill
 
In Refill, water is provided for consumer purchase through the installation of self-service coin-operated and non-coin-operated vending displays. Coin-operated vending displays are generally placed outside retail locations, and the retailer is paid a percentage of sales as a commission.
 
Non-coin-operated vending displays are placed inside retail locations, typically in the water aisle or on an outer wall of the store, and the consumer pays for the vended water at check-out directly to the retailer. Under certain arrangements, the retailer then keeps a percentage of sales generated as a commission and remits the remainder to us, while under other arrangements, the retailer pays us a fee based on the number of gallons of water purchased by the end consumers. Meter read data necessary for billing the retailer is transmitted to us electronically or obtained by the company service technicians.
 
In some arrangements, the reverse osmosis water filtration equipment necessary to filter water is installed in the back room of a retail location. A water line is installed from the water filtration equipment to the self-service refill drinking water display. In other arrangements, the reverse osmosis water filtration equipment and the water vending display are together as one unit. We own the water filtration and vending displays and the required service and maintenance on the systems is performed by our company service technicians. We work with the retailer to determine the location of the self-service refill drinking water display and the retailer is typically responsible for the required municipally supplied water and for the electricity to operate the displays. Installation costs, including plumbing, electrical and drainage requirements, may be the responsibility of the retailer or Primo, depending on the arrangement.
 
We utilize our manufacturing facilities to assemble, refurbish and repair our refill machines. We routinely refurbish equipment that has been in service for several years or when a customer requests refreshed equipment.
 
The regular service and maintenance of our reverse osmosis water filtration equipment generally includes a sanitization of the self-service refill water display, a system component check and any necessary preventative maintenance resulting from such component check and may include a water test for regulatory purposes. The various jurisdictions in which we operate have specific weekly, bimonthly, monthly, quarterly or annual water testing reporting requirements with which we comply, but we generally perform water tests semi-annually. As part of the routine visits to the vending displays, technicians will collect cash from the coin-operated machines. Depending upon the arrangement, the technician may obtain a meter reading to determine retail customer water usage. For certain locations, meter readings and other data are transmitted to us electronically, allowing for proactive, remote monitoring and reducing unnecessary visits to customer locations.
 
Our quality control team ensures that operation and sanitation standards with respect to our Refill business meet or exceed the requirements of federal and state regulations, requirements, National Automatic Merchandising Association (“NAMA”) standards, and other industry standards. As we seek to promote our brand, we believe it is critical to provide refill drinking water that is produced in a manner that exceeds current industry requirements. We regularly monitor, test and arrange for third-party quality testing of our self-service refill water displays and reverse osmosis water filtration systems.

Exchange

In Exchange, our independent bottlers and distributors, including DS Services, a subsidiary of Cott Corporation, on whom we rely to perform the majority of the bottling and distribution responsibilities in our Exchange business, are responsible for the water purification, bottling and distribution processes and use their own equipment to complete these responsibilities. Our bottling process begins with either spring water or water from a public source that is processed through a pre-filtration stage to remove large particles. The water is then passed through polishing filters to catch smaller particles followed by a carbon filtration process that removes odors, tastes, sanitization by-products and pharmaceutical chemicals. A microfiltration process then removes microbes before the water is passed through a softener to increase the purification efficiency. The water next passes through the last phase of reverse osmosis or distillation, completing the purification process. After the purification process is complete, our proprietary blend of mineral ingredients is injected into the water followed by the final ozonation process to sanitize the water. Each of our production lots is placed on a 48-hour hold to allow for testing by the bottler and to ensure successful compliance with chemical and microbiological standards. We have the ability to trace each bottle of Primo water to its bottling and distributor sources, and we regularly perform recall tests to ensure our ability to react to a contamination event should it occur.
 
Utilizing either our systems or their own systems, we can anticipate demand and scheduling requirements in a distributor’s territory. The distributor uses this information to load a truck with the appropriate inventory to stock or restock the Exchange sales displays on its route. Upon arrival at each retail location, the driver first visits the recycling center display to collect empty Primo and other dispenser-compatible bottles. The driver collects the data related to empty bottles and then loads the empty bottles onto the truck. The driver next checks the in-store sales display to compare the number of remaining bottles of water with the anticipated demand. After capturing data related to current stock levels, the driver replenishes the sales display. Critical data collected by distributors is transmitted to Primo and used to analyze and validate activity. Our distributors also capture electronic signatures, significantly reducing paper exchange.
 
At the completion of the delivery cycle, a distributor inspects the exchanged bottles for reusability. Our Exchange water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to 40 times before being taken out of use, crushed and recycled, substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of similar amounts of single-serve bottled water. Bottles that pass a distributor’s initial inspection are subject to three washing cycles to wash and disinfect. Bottles are then passed through two sanitization stages before a final rinse with hyper-ozonated water to kill or inactivate any microbes that remain at that point in the sanitization process. The water bottles are then ready to be filled with our purified water, as described above.
 
We work very closely with our bottling and distribution network to ensure their production and storage standards meet or exceed the requirements of the FDA and other industry regulations. As we seek to promote our brand, we believe it is critical to provide bottled water that has consistent taste and is produced in a manner that exceeds current industry requirements. In addition, we regularly monitor our distributors’ performance to ensure a high level of account service.
 
Flow of Payments and Capital Requirements

We control the flow of payments between our retail customers and our distributors and service providers through electronic data interchange. Our retail customers are billed for outstanding amounts owed in three different methods, depending on the retail customer: (i) distributors present the store manager with an invoice for the bottles delivered for Exchange; (ii) our company service technician presents a meter reading or (iii) our systems electronically bill the retailer. In our coin-based refill business, we collect cash directly from the consumer and pay the retailer a commission based upon the sales generally within 30 days. Exchange provides five-gallon bottles of purified water that typically cost a consumer approximately $6.99, after giving effect to the discount provided by our recycling ticket, while Refill typically costs a consumer between $0.25 and $0.50 per gallon, depending upon the geographic location, the retailer, the machine type (indoor or outdoor) and overall pricing strategy.
 
We generally compensate our Exchange distributors with a fixed payment per delivered Exchange water bottle. Due to the high degree of automation during our billing and inventory management procedures, we are able to leverage our centralized personnel and believe we will be able to significantly expand our business with minimal increases in variable costs.
 
 10


We focus our capital investments on raising brand awareness, growth marketing initiatives, developing new retail relationships, installing new store locations and research and development for new products. We are also responsible for the centralized operations and personnel, sales and recycling displays, bottles, reverse osmosis equipment and parts, displays and handheld devices. Our Exchange bottling and distribution network typically has made the capital investment required to operate our businesses, including a majority of the capital expenditures related to the bottling, sanitization and refill process and the distribution assets such as delivery trucks and warehouse storage. Participation in Exchange does not typically require the independent bottlers, distributors or service providers to make substantial new investments because they often are able to augment their current production capacity and leverage their existing bottling and distribution assets as well as personnel. In addition, many of our major retail customers have invested their capital to expand store locations and generate customer traffic.
 
Retailer Relationships

We target major retailers with either a national footprint or a significant regional concentration. Our relationships are diversified among the following retail categories and major accounts:

Retail Category | Major Accounts 
Home Centers / Hardware Stores | Lowe’s Home Improvement, The Home Depot, Ace Hardware 
Mass Merchants | Walmart, Meijer 
Grocery Stores | Kroger, Food Lion, Safeway, H-E-B, Hy-Vee, Albertsons, Publix
Membership Warehouses | Sam’s Club, Costco 
Drug Stores | Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid 
Convenience Stores | Circle K 
Office Retail Dollar | Office Depot Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar General 

Retailer Opportunity. We provide major retailers throughout the United States and Canada with a single-vendor solution for Dispensers, Exchange and Refill. We provide retailers with a year-round consumer product and an opportunity to increase sales and profits with minimal labor and financial investment. Through our Exchange bottling and distribution network and our Refill employee service network, we are able to service major retailers throughout the United States and Canada. Retailers benefit from Exchange and Refill which offer high margins and generate productivity from often underutilized interior and exterior retail space. In addition, these offerings have the potential to increase retailers’ sales of ancillary products through increased traffic from repeat water consumers, who we believe exchange or refill an average of 35 five-gallon water bottles annually.
 
Account Set-Up. We actively pursue headquarters-based retail relationships to better serve our retail partners and minimize layers of approval and decision-making with regard to the roll-out of Exchange or Refill to multiple locations. Our sales team also pursues regional and local retailers, which greatly expands the opportunity for our retail reach. Upon confirmation of new retail locations, we coordinate with the retailer to schedule openings in a timely manner. We actively assist retailers in developing site plans for the setup of our sales and recycling center displays and reverse osmosis water filtration systems. While retailer setup preferences may vary, retailers often like to locate the recycling center display prominently on the exterior of their store to ease the transaction process, showcase their recycling and environmental efforts and conserve inside floor space while at the same time promoting the Primo brand. A majority of our refill locations are located on the exterior of the store.
 
Same Store Sales. We drive same store sales across brick and mortar and online retailers. Our marketing and shopper marketing teams leverage marketing research and market tests to determine the most cost effective and impactful methods to grow our retail partners’ businesses. These techniques include improved communications, new merchandising and packaging, advertising and social media marketing. Additionally, we have implemented an instant redeemable coupon program that introduces new Primo dispenser owners to our water products with a free water offer upon purchase of a dispenser.
Account Service. Exchange and Refill are turn-key programs for retailers in which we and our distributors and company field service organization actively service each retail account. After the retail location is established, our distributors and service providers complete on-site training and have an economic interest in supporting and growing the business relationship to increase product throughput.
 
 11


Sales Support. While distributors service our Exchange retail accounts, the customer relationship is “owned” and maintained by our experienced retail sales organization, which allows us to develop strong brand affinity and maintain key headquarters-based relationships to secure and maintain our retail network. Our retail sales organization is responsible for selling and supporting Refill, Exchange and Dispensers to targeted retailers.
Significant Customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Walmart, Lowe’s Home Improvement and Home Depot represented approximately 33%, 9% and 8% of our consolidated net sales; 25%, 0%, and 0% of our Refill net sales; 29%, 20%, and 29% of our Exchange net sales and 66%, 20%, and 2% of our Dispenser net sales, respectively.
Information Technology Systems
 
We have made a substantial investment in information technology (“IT”) systems which enhance our ability to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable, maintain distributor and customer information, manage our company field service organization, maintain cost-efficient operations and assist in delivering products on a timely basis. Our technology utilizes highly integrated, scalable software applications that cost-effectively support our network of retail partners. Our IT systems also allow us to analyze historical trends and data to further enhance the execution, service and identification of new markets and marketing opportunities. The primary components of our systems include the following:
Sales and Marketing Support Systems. We operate a customer relationship management database that integrates all financial and transaction-based data with respect to each retail account. Our IT systems provide our account managers and customer service specialists’ access to crucial data to effectively manage each bottler, distributor and retail relationship.
Bottler and Distributor Level Technology. Our distribution process is highly automated and scalable. Our technology allows bottlers and distributors timely access to information for customer support needs and provides access to real-time data to enhance decisions. All delivery transactional information is uploaded from our distributors electronically creating a paperless environment.
Refill Service Technician Technology. Our Refill service technicians utilize smartphones to identify our assets via bar code scan. For our coin operated vending units, the technicians will download sales data from our vending equipment, which is used to reconcile the cash collected from the machine as well as serve as a basis for paying commissions to retailers. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we began to install credit card payment processing technology on our outdoor Refill machines. We believe that this credit card payment processing technology, in addition to providing our customers with increased payment options, will provide us the ability to remotely monitor our outdoor Refill machines in real time and ensure they are in continuous operation. For our non-coin operated units, the technicians gather water usage meter reads on their smartphones, which in turn creates an invoice for the amount of water that will be billed to our retailers. For a significant amount of our Refill customers, meter readings and other data are transmitted to us electronically, allowing for proactive, remote monitoring and reducing unnecessary visits to customer locations.
Financial Integration. We utilize Microsoft’s Dynamics GP software as our core platform which interfaces with all of our systems. All transactions are validated and data is imported into our database tables and mapped to corresponding accounting ledgers.
Manufacturing and Sourcing

Our manufacturing strategy for our Exchange and Dispenser businesses is to utilize independent manufacturers to produce empty water bottles, sales displays and recycle centers, and water dispensers at a reasonable cost. We believe that using independent manufacturers has several advantages over our manufacturing these items directly, including (i) decreased capital investment in manufacturing plants and equipment and working capital, (ii) the ability to leverage independent manufacturers’ purchasing relationships for lower materials costs, (iii) minimal fixed costs of maintaining unused manufacturing capacity and (iv) the ability to utilize our suppliers’ broad technical and process expertise.
 
For our reverse osmosis water filtration systems and self-service filtered water displays, we source parts from independent manufacturers and perform final assembly at our Vista, California facility. The assembly process involves installing replaceable panels and component parts on frames built to last for many years. Individual filters and other processing components are generally sourced by us from multiple suppliers.
 
 12


Currently, all of our Dispensers are assembled by independent manufacturers in China, which utilize several sub-suppliers to provide components and subassemblies. We have the sole North American rights to develop products with certain manufacturers and each dispenser unit is produced to our design specifications. Each unit is inspected and tested for quality by the manufacturer’s personnel prior to shipment.
 
Our water bottles are produced by multiple independent vendors throughout North America. We select suppliers based on price, quality and geographic proximity to our bottlers and retail customers. We purchase only water bottles with handles for Exchange as a convenience feature for consumers.
 
Our sales displays and recycle centers are made to our design. We frequently request bids from multiple independent manufacturers to achieve optimal pricing.
 
Product Design and Development

A primary focus of our product research and development efforts is developing innovative water dispensers as part of our strategy to enhance consumer awareness and adoption of our Water products, increase household penetration and drive sales of our water. We continually work to improve water dispenser features, seek to lower manufacturing costs so that our innovative products are more affordable and introduce new models. Innovative improvements developed in cooperation with our manufacturing partners include bottom-loading dispensers, integrated K-cup® technology, a pet water dispenser, self-sanitizing units as well as faster water dispensing capabilities. Our water dispenser models are designed to appeal to consumers of diverse demographic audiences.
Competition

We participate in the highly competitive bottled water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry. While the industry is dominated by large and well-known international companies, numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches. We believe we have a unique business model in the bottled water market in the United States and Canada in that we not only offer three- and five-gallon bottled water on a nationwide basis but also provide consumers the ability to exchange their used containers as part of our Exchange business. We believe that we are one of the first companies to provide a national exchange solution at retail. While we are aware of a few direct competitors that operate similar networks, we believe they operate on a much smaller scale than we do and do not have equivalent systems or bottler and distributor capabilities to effectively support major retailers nationwide. Competitive factors with respect to our business include convenience, pricing, taste, advertising, sales promotion programs, product innovation, efficient production and distribution techniques, introduction of new packaging, and brand and trademark development and protection.
 
Our primary competitor in our Exchange business is Nestlé. Nestlé offers bottled water exchange to regional, but not national retailers. However, Nestlé is a leading consumer products company, has substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, has established a strong brand presence with consumers and has established relationships with retailers, manufacturers, bottlers and distributors necessary to start an exchange business at retail locations nationwide should they decide to do so. In addition to competition between firms within the bottled water industry, the industry itself faces significant competition from other non-alcoholic beverages, including carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks and waters, juices, sport and energy drinks, coffees, teas and spring and tap water.
 
We also compete directly and indirectly in the water dispenser marketplace. This marketplace is diverse and faces competition from other methods of purified water consumption such as countertop filtration systems, faucet mounted filtration systems, in-line whole-house filtration systems, water filtration dispensing products such as pitchers and jugs, standard and advanced feature water coolers and refrigerator-dispensed filtered and unfiltered water.

Refill also participates in the highly competitive purified water segment of the non-alcoholic beverage industry. Our Refill business model is differentiated from most of the participants in the North American nonalcoholic beverage industry in that it offers self-service refill of drinking water. There are few direct competitors that offer similar refill products, and we believe these direct competitors generally operate on a smaller geographical and operational scale than our Refill business. Refill faces two levels of competition: (i) competition at the retail customer level to secure placement of its reverse osmosis water filtration systems in the store; and (ii) competition at an end-user level to convince consumers to purchase its water versus other options. Competitive factors with respect to our Refill business include pricing, taste, advertising, sales promotion programs, retail placement, introduction of new packaging and branding.
 
Many of the indirect competitors in the bottled water segment of the nonalcoholic beverage industry are leading consumer products companies, have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers, manufacturers, bottlers and distributors necessary to start a self-service drinking water refill business at North American retail locations should they decide to do so.
 
Intellectual Property and Trademarks

We believe that our intellectual property provides a competitive advantage and we have invested substantial time, effort and capital in establishing and protecting our intellectual property rights. We have filed certain patent applications and trademark registration applications and intend to seek additional patents, to develop additional trademarks and seek federal registrations for such trademarks and to develop other intellectual property. We consider our Primo tradenames, our related trademarks, and our other intellectual property to be valuable to our business.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other arrangements to protect our proprietary rights. We own United States federal trademark registrations for our Primo® and Taste Perfection® trademarks, our Primo® logo and our distinctive four bubble design.  U.S. federal trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed. In addition, our recycling center is protected by a United States utility patent and four United States design patents. The United States design patents expire between May 2021 and April 2022.  We also have patents to our unique ice machine that produce bagged ice on-site at a retailer.
 
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and other non-patented proprietary information relating to our product development, business processes and operating activities. We regard the composition of our mineral formula to be valuable trade secrets of Primo. We seek to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy, including confidentiality agreements.

Governmental Regulation

The conduct of our businesses and the production, distribution, advertising, promotion, labeling, safety, transportation, sale and use of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, provincial and local governmental agencies in the United States and Canada. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations that apply to us, and we require our bottling, manufacturing, and distributing partners to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them.
 
We are required to comply with:
 

● | federal laws, such as the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Canadian Food and Drug Act, the US Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customs and foreign trade laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | state and provincial consumer protection laws;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | laws governing equal employment opportunity and workplace activities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | various other federal, state, provincial and local statutes and regulations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We maintain environmental, health and safety policies and a quality, environmental, health and safety program designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
The FDA regulates bottled water as a food under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Health Canada (“HC”) (Division 12) regulates bottled water in Canada. Our bottled water must meet FDA and HC requirements of safety for human consumption, identity, quality and labeling. Further, the sale and marketing of our products is subject to FDA’s and HC’s and the US FTC and Canadian Competition Bureau advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions. In addition, FDA and HC has established current “good manufacturing practice” regulations, which govern the facilities, methods, practices and controls used for the processing, bottling and distribution of bottled drinking water. We and our third-party supply, bottling and distribution partners are subject to these requirements. We also must comply with overlapping and sometimes inconsistent state and provincial regulations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we must expend resources to continuously monitor state and provincial legislative and regulatory activities for purposes of identifying and ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to our bottled water business in each state in which we operate. While we must meet the government-mandated standards, we believe that our self-imposed standards meet or exceed those set by federal, state, provincial and local regulations.
 
Additionally, the manufacture, sale and use of resins used to make water bottles are subject to regulation by the FDA and HC. Those regulations are concerned with substances used in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. We believe our beverage containers are in compliance with FDA and HC regulations. Additionally, the use of polycarbonates in food containers used by children under three years of age is subject to certain state and local restrictions.
 
Measures have been enacted in various localities, provinces and states that require a deposit or tax to be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state, provincial and federal levels.
 
The refill machines used with the reverse osmosis water filtration systems are certified by NAMA. NAMA maintains a certification program which evaluates food and beverage machines against current requirements of the U.S. Public Health Service Ordinance and Code. Currently, there are no U.S. or Canadian regulations that cover our refill machines. However, certain states, provinces and other regional localities have permit and testing requirements for the operation of the refill machines. All water testing is performed by independent nationally accredited labs.

The cost of compliance with federal, state and local environmental provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the year ended December 31, 2018, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
Environmental, Social and Corporate Responsibility
 
We believe that integrating and promoting best practices in the areas of environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance into our day-to-day operations underscores the importance of conducting business ethically and responsibly by delivering value to our customers, building strong communities, leveraging innovation and supporting the expertise, dedication and commitment of our employees and the communities in which they work. 
Environmental Stewardship
 
Traditional water consumption, particularly via single-serve plastic water bottles, is environmentally unsustainable.  2017 data shows that, globally, approximately 1 million plastic bottles are purchased each minute, and that approximately 70% of plastic bottles once consumed are not recycled.  Given that a single plastic bottle can take over 1,000 years to completely biodegrade, the current bottled and purified water consumption business model requires fundamental changes to meet consumer preferences for environmentally-friendly products.  Recently proposed legislation reflects these concerns with the passage of “bottle bills” in many jurisdictions that tax the purchase of plastic water bottles, require deposits with the purchase of certain plastic bottles, prohibit the use of government funds to purchase plastic water bottles and ban certain plastic bottles from landfills.
 
As a purpose-driven company aiming to inspire healthier lives through better water, we are building our Refill, Exchange and Dispenser businesses in a manner that seeks to achieve a sustainable solution to the world’s problem of excessive plastic consumption and disposal.   We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally conscious and effective. We estimate that approximately 1,100 single-serve plastic bottles are saved by a single five-gallon bottle used in our Refill or Exchange water.  Further, each of our multi-gallon Exchange water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to 40 times before being taken out of use, crushed and recycled, substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of equivalent volumes of single-serve bottled water.  We estimate that, since 2004, approximately 14.5 billion single-serve plastic bottles have been saved by consumer adoption of our Refill, Exchange and Dispenser products and offerings.  We believe our focus on achieving an environmentally sustainable solution to the delivery and consumption of purified and filtered water provides a competitive advantage as we aim to meet the demands of consumers increasingly favoring products with a lower environmental impact with a “reuse, recycle, reduce” mindset becoming a common driver of their behavior.
 
Our Refill systems provide safe and economical drinking water to consumers by means of our environmentally friendly business model. Consumers reuse their water bottles by refilling them with sterilized high purity reverse osmosis water from our dispensers. This eliminates the need to purchase expensive, resource-consuming single-serve bottled water, which, when finished, are often disposed in landfill sites, oceans and other receiving streams.
 
Further, we have strategically placed over 24,000 Refill systems at grocery/retail locations across the United States and Canada. This ensures that refill water purchases are made efficiently during regular shopping trips, reducing the transportation time and related carbon emissions. There are no isolated, stand-alone Primo refill systems or systems located in water treatment specialty shops.
 
Recent improvements and investments in systems technology may substantially reduce our carbon footprint by cutting down on the number of driving hours by our service technicians. Our Refill service routes and dispatches are now managed by means of sophisticated routing and equipment maintenance software. This software monitors and directs our field service technicians via cellular and GPS technology to perform scheduled or emergency service. The system knows the location, schedule, traffic conditions and associated tasks for our technicians and will assign service calls in the most efficient manner.
 
 16


Our Exchange business model is also environmentally friendly. Consumers return their empty 5 or 3 gallon bulk water bottles to grocery/retail locations throughout the United States and Canada, and exchange it for a full prefilled bottle of Primo water. The empty bottle returns to the bottling plant and is cleaned, sanitized and refilled.
 
The water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States and Canada was given a D- grade by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017. Trillions of dollars will be required to bring water treatment and drinking water distribution into compliance with applicable laws and standards over the next twenty years. In addition, many sources of drinking water are now contaminated with known and emerging contaminants which will likely require sophisticated water treatment technologies to render tap water safe. Providing safe drinking water now will fall to forward thinking companies such as Primo who not only provide water that consumers trust but also provide products that align with a sustainable, environmentally friendly business model. While many water filtration manufacturers promote their faucet filters and other products to remove heavy metals from tap water, the onus is on the user to dispose of them responsibly. A used faucet filter cartridge loaded with lead and or arsenic that is tossed into the residential garbage collection will likely end up in a landfill site, which may contribute to contamination of the groundwater there in years to come. We believe The Primo Way is a better way.
 
Corporate Social Responsibility
 
We have built our corporate vision on these and other principles established in our vision statement, The Primo Way, and work daily to maintain an environment which is open, diverse and inclusive, and where our team members feel valued and included in our broader mission. Examples of our active and engaged commitment to our communities and social responsibility more broadly can be seen in, among other matters:

● | Active responses to communities affected by hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, including assistance with disaster relief efforts and the donation of Primo bottles and dispensers to affected communities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Donation of bottles and dispensers to several charitable and community service initiatives including the Pan-Mass challenge, the Los Angeles Chinatown Firecracker Run and the National MS Tour to Tanglewood;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nationwide support of local non-profit organizations by providing water, dispensers and volunteer support to offset related costs and volunteer needs, including for the benefit of the American Diabetes Association and the Specially Fit Foundation, a non-profit organization encouraging active participation in exercise activities by those in underserved communities, including individuals with special needs and children living in foster care; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support for a variety of animal welfare organizations, including chapters of the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) throughout the country through donations of water and dispensers at SPCA animal shelters, pet food banks, pet training facilities, public veterinary centers, vaccination clinics and adoption drives.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corporate Governance
 
In addition to our promotion of environmental and social responsibility best practices, we have a long-standing commitment to upholding a high level of ethical and corporate governance practices and standards, and we emphasize the importance of professional business conduct and ethics through our corporate governance initiatives. The Board of Directors has adopted a robust set of corporate governance practices to help it fulfill its responsibilities to stockholders in providing direction and oversight of management.
 
Earlier this year, the Board of Directors approved a series of corporate governance-related enhancements to strengthen and improve our commitment to adopting and enforcing strong corporate governance practices. Among others, the Board of Directors adopted a new set of Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board and its committees in the exercise of its responsibilities and to establish a common set of expectations and guidelines to provide a strong and robust governance framework for the Company. 
 
In January 2019, the Board of Directors appointed Susan Cates to serve as Lead Independent Director.  In her new role as Lead Independent Director, Ms. Cates will be responsible for helping to set agendas for meetings of the Board of Directors, leading the Board’s review of management performance and the succession planning process currently underway.  Ms. Cates will also lead executive sessions of the independent members of the Board and, if requested by major stockholders, ensure her availability for consultation and direct communication as part of a Primo-wide initiative to enhance stockholder outreach and communication.

In addition, the Board adopted a Board Diversity Policy that reinforces and reflects the Board’s belief that diversity is a core value of Primo, a strategic driver of its success, and that diverse membership of the Board with varying perspectives and breadth of experience promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas and results in both better corporate governance and improved corporate performance. In addition, the Board and each of its committees approved amended and restated committee charters requiring and promoting certain best practices in the operation of each committee.
 
Further, the Board has enhanced its commitment to solicit ongoing feedback from major shareholders and to provide for continued and robust shareholder engagement throughout the year.  The Board welcomes feedback on its corporate governance and executive compensation practices and policies and believes that this continued engagement with shareholders will further align the long-term interests of the Board, the Company, its management and its shareholders.
 
Our corporate governance policies and practices are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Board Diversity Policy. We also have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) applicable to all employees, officers and directors of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. The Board has adopted charters for each of its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee. You may review the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Conduct and our Committee charters under the “Investor Relations” section of our website, under the subheading “Corporate Governance,” on our website at: http://www.primowater.com. You may also obtain a copy of these documents by mailing a request to: Primo Water Corporation, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 101 North Cherry Street, Suite 501, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101.
 
Seasonality

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating income. Our sales and operating income have been highest in the spring and summer, and lowest in the fall and winter. Our Refill and Exchange segments, which generally enjoy higher margins than our Dispensers segment, experience higher sales and operating income in the spring and summer. We have historically experienced higher sales and operating income from Dispensers in spring and summer; however, we believe the seasonality of dispenser sales are more dependent on retailer inventory management and purchasing cycles and not correlated to weather. Sustained periods of poor weather, particularly in the spring and summer, can negatively impact our sales in our higher margin Refill and Exchange segments. Accordingly, our results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a fiscal year or any future quarter.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 602 employees. We believe that our continued success will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
