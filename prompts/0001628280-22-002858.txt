ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
FARO was founded in 1982 and re-incorporated in Florida in 1992. Our worldwide headquarters are located at 250 Technology Park, Lake Mary, Florida 32746 and our telephone number is (407) 333-9911.
We are a global technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports software driven, three-dimensional (“3D”) measurement, imaging, and realization solutions for the 3D metrology, architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”), Operations and Maintenance (“O&M”) and public safety analytics markets. We enable our customers to capture, measure, manipulate, interact with and share 3D and 2D data from the physical world in a virtual environment and then translate this information back into the physical domain. Our broad technology set equips our customers with a wide range of 3D capture technologies that range from ultra-high accuracy laser scanner based technology to lower accuracy, photogrammetry based technology. Our FARO suite of 3D products and software solutions are used for inspection of components and assemblies, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering, documenting large volume or structures in 3D, surveying and construction, construction management, assembly layout, machine guidance as well as in investigation and reconstructions of crash and crime scenes. We sell the majority of our solutions through a direct sales force, with an increasing volume being sold through an indirect channel across a range of industries including automotive, aerospace, metal and machine fabrication, surveying, architecture, engineering and construction, public safety forensics and other industries.
COVID-19
Our business is significantly vulnerable to the economic effects of pandemics and other public health crises, including the ongoing novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic that has surfaced in virtually every country of our global operating footprint. During 2020, we experienced a significant decline in the demand for our products and services across all of our served markets as a result of the impact of the spread of COVID-19. While COVID-19 has negatively impacted demand for our products and services overall, it has provided us with the opportunity to adapt to operating in a virtual environment. We significantly increased the utilization of our existing virtual sales demonstration infrastructure which has enabled ongoing customer product education. We launched an updated web-based learning system with FARO Academy that has resulted in an increase in the attendance of our virtual training and product information seminars as our customers take advantage of the opportunity to remotely participate and to better understand the capabilities of our products and software offerings.
During 2021, while we saw a recovery in our revenue across our served industries, we continued to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business results and we remained committed to taking actions to mitigate both the impact on the health and safety of our employees, as well as negative business effects resulting from demand disruption, material availability and potential production challenges, including, but not limited to, the following:
•Operating our business with a focus on our employee health and safety, which includes minimizing travel, implementing remote work policies, maintaining employee distancing and enhancing the sanitation of all of our facilities;
•Isolating our production environment from non-essential personnel, to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposures;
•Recommending that our employees receive vaccinations to help protect our colleagues, families, and communities;
•Confidentially collecting proof of vaccination from our employees or requiring weekly COVID-19 testing to use certain facilities;
•Aggressively pursuing required raw materials to ensure continuity of supply and minimize material cost increases;
•Monitoring our liquidity, disciplined inventory management, and limiting capital expenditures; and
•Continuously reviewing our financial strategy to enhance financial flexibility in these volatile financial markets.
We continue to maintain a strong capital structure with a cash balance of $122.0 million and no debt as of December 31, 2021. We believe that our liquidity position is adequate to meet our projected needs in the reasonably foreseeable future.
Future developments, such as the potential resurgence of COVID-19 and actions taken by governments in response to current and future resurgence, are highly uncertain. Therefore, the Company is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact the Company’s results of operations and financial conditions.

Strategy
As part of our new strategic plan, and based on the recommendation of our CEO, who is also our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), in the fourth quarter of 2019, we eliminated our vertical structure in favor of a functional structure. Our new executive leadership team is comprised of functional leaders in areas such as sales, marketing, operations, research and development and general and administrative, and resources are allocated to each function at a consolidated unit level. We no longer have separate business units, segment managers or vertical leaders who report to the CODM with respect to operations, operating results or planning for levels or components below the total Company level. Instead, our CODM now allocates resources and evaluates performance on a company-wide basis. Based on these changes, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2019, we report as one reporting segment that develops, manufactures, markets, supports and sells a suite of 3D imaging and software solutions. 
In addition to the reorganization of the Company’s structure, we evaluated our hardware and software product portfolio and the operations of certain of our recent acquisitions. As a result of this evaluation, we simplified our hardware and software product portfolio and divested our Photonics business and 3D Design related assets obtained from our acquisition of Opto-Tech SRL and its subsidiary Open Technologies SRL (collectively, “Open Technologies”) in the second quarter of 2020.
On February 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a global restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”), which supports our strategic plan in an effort to improve operating performance and ensure that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to our shareholders and customers. Key activities under the Restructuring Plan have achieved $39.6 million in annualized Non-GAAP savings that were realized by the end of fiscal year 2021 and included decreasing total headcount by approximately 500 employees upon the completion of the Restructuring Plan. The elimination of our vertical structure allowed us to successfully complete our redefined go-to-market strategy which placed increased focus on our customers and enabled our sales employees, supported by our talented pool of field application engineers, to sell all product lines globally. 
Our new marketing leadership team has focused its efforts on gaining an increased understanding of customer applications and workflows which enables value-based product positioning while optimizing our customer's total cost of ownership. By strengthening our understanding of customer applications and workflows, we will continue to develop high-value solutions across our product and software platforms. Also, our marketing leadership team has transformed our lead generation process and implemented technology to provide our sales organization with higher quality leads which optimizes the time and effort spent by our newly organized sales team. 
We continue to focus on organizational optimization and improved decision making throughout the Company. Prior to the execution of the Restructuring Plan, the Company had strong geographic organizations with decentralized decision making. Additionally, the previous vertical structure layered on top of the geographic organization led to an overly complex and costly management structure. The newly formed global functional organization has enabled centralized management and clear process ownership, eliminating redundant resources and increasing the Company's agility and ability to execute the new strategic plan during the COVID-19 global pandemic.
We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $15.8 million and paid $13.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisting of severance and related benefits, professional fees and other related charges. We have continued to make significant progress in executing the Restructuring Plan during 2021. We recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $7.4 million and paid $5.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisting of severance and related benefits, professional fees and other related charges and costs.
On July 15, 2021, we entered into a manufacturing services agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sanmina Corporation (“Sanmina”), in connection with the Restructuring Plan. Under the Agreement, Sanmina will provide manufacturing services for the Company’s measurement device products currently manufactured by the Company at the Company’s Lake Mary, Florida, Exton, Pennsylvania, and Stuttgart, Germany manufacturing sites. A phased transition to a Sanmina production facility is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2022 as part of our cost reduction initiative. The Company expects to pay approximately $4 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily consisting of severance and related benefits.
We continue to evaluate our key initiatives and execution of the Restructuring Plan, and expect to incur additional pre-tax charges in the range of $6 million to $10 million through the end of fiscal year 2022.
Acquisition
On June 4, 2021, FARO Technologies, Inc. acquired Holobuilder, Inc. ("Holobuilder"), an American company focused on a photogrammetry-based 3D platform which delivers hardware agnostic image capture, registration and viewing to the Digital Twin market. With an initial focus on Construction Management, Holobuilder’s technology platform provides general contractors a solution to efficiently capture and virtually manage construction progress using off-the-shelf 360° cameras.

Industry Background
We have a wide variety of customers that support a large number of industries, including automotive, aerospace, metal and machine fabrication, surveying, architecture, engineering and construction, as well as, public safety forensics. The pressures in reducing overall manufacturing costs, improving profitability in architecture, engineering and construction (“AEC”) and the need for complete information in public safety are all driving the need for automated solutions to quickly capture accurate 3D data to be made accessible remotely. In each of the industries we serve, there is a growing need for accurate 3D information for high accuracy inspection, machine alignment and calibration, as-built modeling and design, quality control, digital twin and crash and crime scene investigations as well as pre-incident planning. Each of these industries are undergoing a form of transformation where the use of FARO’s digital technology would help improve customers’ yields, reduce costs and drive additional profitability.
In the manufacturing industry, the continued focus on higher yields, cost reductions and decreased time to market all drive the need for accurate information to support overall manufacturing processes which include part quality, machine down time and overall manufacturing yield. The dimensional metrology market will be challenged to continue to provide higher accuracy results and meet the continuing demand of tightening tolerances in both the automotive and aerospace industries. The higher accuracy requirements will also result in trends away from traditional hand measurement tools towards automated and integrated equipment. With increasing pressure on costs, the need for tighter quality control and increased automation will drive the adoption of applications and processes that support real-time 3D information to make quick, accurate decisions resulting in optimized manufacturing processes. Industry 4.0 will also continue to drive the need to have 3D information available on-demand across the entire manufacturing ecosystem.
The emergence of building information modeling (“BIM”) in the AEC market has required improvements in 3D documentation, coordination and simulation across the entire building lifecycle. BIM, in part, is the compilation of a 3D model representation of a project that can be updated real time and compare actual to design. BIM is believed to become more prevalent as it aides in reducing cost associated with scrap and overruns. The ability to obtain accurate, real-time 3D measurements and information will help to replace existing methodologies such as tape measures and chalk lines. In addition, an increase in modular and pre-fab construction is being driven by growing urbanization, government initiatives and a need for affordable housing. Modular and pre-fab construction allow for building all, or large portions of a building and then assembling them on-site. The processes of creating such structures resembles more traditional manufacturing flows where real-time 3D measurements and information can vastly improve the costs associated with re-work of materials and poor quality.
The increased focus in public safety around cost, technology adoption and public scrutiny will increase the acceptance of 3D solutions to accurately capture and analyze crime and crash scenes. Body cams, drones, and advanced analytical software are all examples of increased adoption of technology in the public safety sector. Laser scanning technology is used today to capture crime scenes quickly and accurately before leaving the scene. The 3D point cloud that is generated from this data allows for further detailed analysis around bullet trajectory, blood spatter and cast off with full confidence and without the need to revisit the crime scene. This information can be easily shared between police investigators, district attorneys and defense attorneys across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, crash scenes can also be reconstructed by using the 3D information collected while on-site. This information can also be easily shared among different departments, insurance companies and investigators. 3D data capture and analysis allows pre-incident planning activities to prepare in the event of an emergency such as fires or for tactical planning of safety-relevant events like political summits or schools. The time savings and confidence in data collection and analysis will continue to result in 3D technology becoming an integral set of tools in public safety analytics.

In 2021, we have also acquired HoloBuilder, Inc. "Holobuilder" which addresses a need for less accurate yet higher resolution 3D data. This acquisition brings to FARO its leading photogrammetry-based 3D platform, which delivers hardware agnostic image capture, registration and viewing to the fast-growing Digital Twin market. With an initial focus on construction management, HoloBuilder’s technology platform provides general contractors a solution to efficiently capture and virtually manage construction progress using off-the-shelf 360° cameras. Further, HoloBuilder’s SaaS platform will add fast and easy reality-capture photo documentation and added remote access capability to FARO’s highly-accurate 3D point cloud-based laser scanning to create the industry’s first end-to-end Digital Twin solution. The combined solution will provide comprehensive scanning and image management capabilities for the Digital Twin market including robotic assembly 3D simulation, construction management, facilities operations and management, and incident pre-planning.

Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain what we believe to be our technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of both our hardware and software products and the development of new applications and products that provide 3D measurement and imaging solutions. The field of 3D measurement and imaging continues to expand, and new technologies and applications will be essential to competing in this market. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the commercialization of new products that build on our existing technological base, and the enhancement and development of additional applications for our products.
Our research and development efforts are directed primarily at enhancing the functional adaptability of our current products and developing new and innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the emerging market for 3D measurement and imaging solutions. Research and development activities, especially with respect to new products and technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there can be no assurance that any of our research and development activities will be completed successfully or on schedule, or, if completed, will be commercially accepted.
At December 31, 2021, we employed 322 scientists and technicians in our research and development efforts. Research and development expenses were approximately $48.8 million in 2021, compared to $42.9 million in 2020 and $44.2 million in 2019.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 725 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, which generally expire on a rolling basis between 2023 and 2043. We also own approximately 122 trademark registrations worldwide, with 158 pending trademark applications.
Our success and ability to maintain a competitive position depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or preclude third-party development of similar intellectual property.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to vigorously defend our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. However, policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, particularly in foreign countries, 
Table of Contents

and we may be unable to determine the extent, if any, to which unauthorized uses of our products exist. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
We do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid, proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. Such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Manufacturing and Assembly
Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling and integrating components and subassemblies purchased from suppliers into finished products. The primary components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are produced by subcontractors according to our specifications. Products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality before shipment. We perform limited in-house circuit board assembly and component part machining. Typically, we enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing components to cover production requirements for 60 to 120 days. We have entered, and may continue to enter, into longer agreements to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy warranty commitments or to ensure adequate component availability. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules. However, we are continuing to monitor ongoing supply chain disruptions that may constrain the availability of raw materials and components used in our products and remain committed to aggressively pursuing adequate sources to ensure continuity of supply and minimize material cost increases that would negatively impact our business.
Our manufacturing, engineering, and design headquarters have been registered to the ISO 9001 standard since July 1998. Semi-annual surveillance audits have documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard. Currently, our manufacturing sites in Lake Mary, Florida; Exton, Pennsylvania; Stuttgart, Germany; and Singapore are jointly registered to ISO 9001. Our FARO Laser Tracker, FaroArm®, and FAROBluTM laser line probe products are all registered to ISO 17025:2005. We continue to examine our scope of registration as our business evolves, and we have chosen English as the standard business language for our operations.
Our efforts to register our manufacturing, engineering and design headquarters to the ISO 9001 standard in concert with the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Certification verifies our commitment to quality through an internationally recognized standard. Additionally, we take a global approach to ISO 17025:2005 regarding the recognition of the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories, seeking to have all locations registered with similar scopes of accreditation and capabilities for the products generated and serviced.

Our measurement systems compete in the broad and highly competitive market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications, which, in addition to portable articulated arms, laser trackers, 3D imaging and laser scanner products, consist of fixed-base CMMs, templates and go/no-go gages, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and various categories of surveying equipment. In the FaroArm® portfolio, FARO Laser Tracker, and FARO Focus solution lines, we compete primarily with Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a division of Hexagon AB; Automated Precision, Inc.; Artec Europe, S.a.r.l.; Leica Geosystems AG, a division of Hexagon AB; Creaform, a division of Ametek; and Trimble Inc. In the FARO Laser Projector product line, we compete primarily with Virtek Vision International, a division of Gerber Technology LLC. In our cloud based virtual reality capturing software, HolobuilderTM product line, we compete primarily with Matterport. We also compete in these product lines with a number of other smaller companies. We compete on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality and value with respect to all of our products. 
We will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain and extend the technological advantage that we believe we currently have over our competition. However, we cannot be certain that our technology or our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. As the market for our measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge, and our existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we participate.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings, and the use of local employees and suppliers. Our foreign operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws, which makes illegal any payments to government officials or government employees that are intended to induce their influence to assist us or to gain any improper advantage for us. We operate in certain regions in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific that are more prone to risk under these anti-corruption laws.
Manufacturers of electrical goods are subject to the European Union’s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. We currently hold RoHS2 and WEEE registration, and we believe we are in compliance with such directives of the European Union. 
In addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. Most notably, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, expands data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the United States, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. In addition, U.S. and international laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices in the U.S. and GDPR in the EU) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. For example, evolution of laws governing the cross-border transfer of data, such as the invalidation of the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield, creates additional uncertainty around the legality and logistics of such transfers. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs.

We historically have sold our products and related services to the U.S. Government (the “Government”) under two General Services Administration (“GSA”) Federal Supply Schedule contracts (the “GSA Contracts”) through the end of 2021. Our sales to the Government under the GSA Contracts represented approximately 1.7% of our total sales for 2021. For sales to the Government beginning in 2022, we expect to sell our products and related services through approved distributors. We chose to make this change in our sales strategy to simplify operations and mitigate compliance risk. The Government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with our distributors either at their discretion or if these distributors default by failing to perform under the terms of their applicable contract, which could impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders.
Backlog and Seasonality
At December 31, 2021, we had orders representing approximately $26.1 million in sales outstanding, of which $10.6 million related to services that we expect to deliver within one year. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had orders representing approximately $19.7 million and $28.0 million in sales outstanding, respectively.
We typically experience greater order volume during the fourth quarter, as customers spend the remaining balances of their capital expenditure budgets.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, we had 1,432 full-time employees worldwide, consisting of 594 sales and marketing professionals, 183 customer service/training/application engineering specialists, 165 production and supply chain staff, 322 research and development staff, and 168 administrative staff. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our employee relations are satisfactory. 
The Company believes that our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel. The executive management team is responsible for developing and executing the Company's human capital strategy. The human capital strategy includes the attraction, acquisition, engagement and development of the Company's employees necessary to execute on our strategy and design of employee compensation and benefits programs to fit the needs of our worldwide employees. The CEO and Chief Human Resource Officer regularly update the Company's board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity and Inclusion: FARO believes in the benefits workforce diversity can provide. Innovation is critical for any technology company – and we believe that it benefits by the creative thinking that happens when people with different perspectives and backgrounds come together. We believe diverse teams can better relate to the many and varied needs of our customers. We promote a culture where individual differences are valued which also allows us to attract the very best talent further encouraging our people to reach their full potential. 
We conduct regular workforce engagement surveys to take the “pulse” of our people and gather their insights, with 77% of our global workforce participating in the September survey. We are committed to taking action on employee feedback and have implemented both corporate and business group action plans to address employee concerns. Further, we are committed to making all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. 
We believe strongly in building a global workforce that is diverse and that can build strong working relationships with our customers in the countries we operate. We support an inclusive culture and motivate our workforce to be themselves while at work. We are committed to providing our employees with a positive and safe work environment that is free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. People development and inclusion are important to us. We understand the importance of giving back to the communities in which we live and work.

Health and Safety: Health, safety, and the well-being of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to achieve world-class safety levels on an annual basis. Our safety culture focuses on reducing workplace injuries and is supported by effective communication and reporting of workplace injuries. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our non-manufacturing and technical service personnel continue to work remote from our offices. Our global manufacturing operations, including facilities located in Pennsylvania, Florida and Germany continue to be designated as essential business and therefore continue to operate. To protect our employees in facilities in which our teams operate, we have employed preventative measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We ensure our preventative measures are in compliance with the most recent local governmental regulations and requirements.
