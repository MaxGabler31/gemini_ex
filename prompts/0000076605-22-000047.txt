ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Patrick,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Patrick Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Company Overview
Patrick is a leading component solutions provider for the recreational vehicle ("RV"), marine, manufactured housing (MH") and various industrial markets – including single and multi-family housing, hospitality, institutional and commercial markets. 
The Company operates through a nationwide network that includes, as of December 31, 2021, 174 manufacturing plants and 64 warehouse and distribution facilities located in 23 states, with a small presence in China and Canada. The Company operates within two reportable segments, Manufacturing and Distribution, through a nationwide network of manufacturing and distribution centers for its products, thereby reducing in-transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing footprint of its customers. The Manufacturing and Distribution segments accounted for 72% and 28%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales for 2021. Financial information about these operating segments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") and incorporated herein by reference. 
The Company’s strategic and capital allocation strategy is to optimally manage and utilize its resources and leverage its platform of operating brands to continue to grow and reinvest in its business. Through strategic acquisitions, expansion both geographically and into new product lines and investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures, Patrick seeks to ensure that its operating network contains capacity, technology and innovative thought processes to support anticipated growth needs, effectively respond to changes in market conditions, inventory and sales levels, and successfully integrate manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions.
Over the last three years, we have executed on a number of new product initiatives and invested approximately $880 million in acquisitions that directly complement our core competencies and existing product lines as well as expand our presence in our primary end markets. 
The Company was incorporated in 1959 in Indiana. The Company's principal executive and administrative offices are located at 107 West Franklin Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46515 and the telephone number is (574) 294-7511; Internet website address: www.patrickind.com. The information on Patrick's website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.

Primary Markets
Patrick manufactures and distributes its products for four primary end markets. Our operating facilities generally are strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. The Company’s sales by market are as follows:

 | 2021 | | 2020
RV | 59 | % | | 56 | %
Marine | 16 | % | | 14 | %
MH | 14 | % | | 17 | %
Industrial | 11 | % | | 13 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | %

Recreational Vehicles
The Company’s RV products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs, smaller OEMs, and to a lesser extent, manufacturers in adjacent industries. The principal types of recreational vehicles include (1) towables: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camping trailers, and truck campers; and (2) motorized: class A (large motor homes), class B (van campers), and class C (small-to-mid size motor homes). The RV market is primarily dominated by Thor Industries, Inc. (“Thor”), Forest River, Inc. (“Forest River”) and Winnebago Industries, Inc. ("Winnebago") which combined held approximately 89% of retail market share for towables and 86% for motorized units for 2021 as reported per Statistical Surveys, Inc. ("SSI"). 
In the late first quarter and early second quarter of 2020, we temporarily curtailed production at certain of our facilities in alignment with the temporary production shutdowns by our RV OEM customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second half of 2020, OEM production improved sharply in response to a strong increase in retail and wholesale demand for RV units, and our sales to our RV OEM customers correspondingly improved. These strong demand trends continued in 2021, with wholesale industry unit shipments increasing by 39% according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association (the “RVIA”), while RV retail unit sales increased by 8% according to SSI.
We estimate that our mix of RV revenues related to towable units and motorized units is consistent with the overall RV industry production mix. In 2021, according to the RVIA, towable and motorized unit shipments represented approximately 91% and 9%, respectively, of total RV industry wholesale shipments with wholesale unit shipments increasing 40% in the towable sector and 38% in the motorized sector in 2021 compared to the prior year.
Recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases, and therefore, any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income can have a negative impact on this market. The Company believes that industry-wide retail sales and the related production levels of RVs will continue to be dependent on the overall strength of the economy, consumer confidence levels, equity securities market trends, fluctuations in dealer inventories, the level of disposable income, and other demographic trends. 
Demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term in the recreational vehicle market, as there is a shift toward outdoor, nature-based tourism activities, with a large segment of the population’s “millennials” and "Gen Xers" embracing this outdoor lifestyle and entering into the RV marketplace as well as an increasing percentage of new campers from more diverse groups. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to increased consumer interest in the RV lifestyle. According to the 2021 KOA North American Camping Report, based on surveys of North American leisure travelers, camping trips and road trips are viewed as the safest forms of travel activities in the current COVID-19 environment, and spending time outdoors with family is the leading motivating factor to return to traveling among leisure travelers and campers. 
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the RV industry is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (the "MD&A") of this Form 10-K. 
Marine 
The marine industry reflects the active, outdoor leisure-based, family-oriented lifestyle and the Company has increased its focus and expanded its presence in this market through recent acquisitions, particularly within the last two years. Consumer demand in the marine market is generally driven by the popularity of the recreational and leisure lifestyle and by economic conditions. Similar to our RV market, the marine industry was impacted by COVID-19 disruptions in 2020 with our plants experiencing temporary shutdowns in the late first quarter and early second quarter of 2020, which were then followed by 
sharp increases in marine demand in the second half of 2020, which we believe is driven in part by an increased interest in outdoor activities, including marine activities, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on leisure preferences that continued into 2021.
According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association ("NMMA"), per its 2020 U.S. Recreational Boating Statistical Abstract (the "Abstract"), total U.S. retail expenditures on boats, engines, accessories, and related costs totaled approximately $49.4 billion in 2020, up approximately 14% from 2019 as stated in the Abstract. The average age of pre-owned boats currently in use is approximately 21 years compared to an average useful life of 30 years.
The Company’s sales to the marine industry are primarily focused on the powerboat sector of the market which is comprised of four main categories: fiberglass, aluminum fishing, pontoon and ski & wake. Based on current available data per SSI through December 2021, within the powerboat sector for 2021, fiberglass units accounted for approximately 38% of retail unit sales, aluminum 26%, pontoon 30% and ski & wake 6%. Based on current available data per SSI through December 2021, marine powerboat retail unit shipments decreased approximately 9% in 2021 compared to 2020, while marine wholesale unit shipments increased approximately 11% in 2021 compared to 2020. Additional information about the Company’s sales to the marine industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.
Manufactured Housing
The Company’s manufactured housing products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of manufactured homes, other OEMs, and to a lesser extent, to manufacturers in adjacent industries. In the aggregate, the top three manufacturers produced approximately 78% of MH market retail unit shipments in 2021 per SSI.
Although wholesale unit shipments have increased in the MH industry from a low of approximately 49,800 units in 2009 to 105,800 units in 2021, they are still trending well below historical levels. The Company believes there is upside potential for this market in the long term driven by pent-up demand, multi-family housing capacity, improving consumer credit and financing conditions, residential housing market conditions, higher consumer confidence levels, increased affordability and quality, demographic trends such as first-time home buyers and urban-to-suburban trends, new home pricing, and improved consumer savings levels. 
Factors that may favorably impact production levels further in this industry include improving quality credit standards in the residential housing market, new jobs growth, consumer confidence, favorable changes in financing regulations, a narrowing in the difference between interest rates on MH loans and mortgages on traditional residential "stick-built" housing, and any improvement in conditions in the asset-backed securities markets for manufactured housing loans.
The MH industry was impacted by disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which resulted in plant shutdowns in the late first quarter and early second quarter of 2020, followed by a recovery that, compared to our RV and marine end markets, emerged more slowly as a result of MH OEM labor and supply disruptions that did not begin to subside until late 2020. This recovery continued into 2021 with growing demand despite continued supply disruptions.
In addition, MH loan program initiatives by Fannie Mae are expected to increase MH loan availability and reduce the total cost of MH borrowing, with a potential resulting increase in MH demand. 
Additional information about the Company’s sales to the MH industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K. 
Industrial Markets
We estimate that approximately 65% of our industrial net sales in 2021 were associated with the U.S. residential housing market. We believe that there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products in this market and new residential housing construction and remodeling activities. Patrick's sales to the industrial market generally lag new housing starts by four to six months as our industrial products are generally among the last components installed in new unit construction and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects. 
Many of Patrick's core manufacturing products are also utilized in the kitchen cabinet, high-rise, office and household furniture, hospitality, and fixtures and commercial furnishings markets. These markets are generally categorized by a more performance-than-price driven customer base, and provide an opportunity for the Company to diversify its customer base. Additionally, other residential and commercial segments have been less vulnerable to import competition, and therefore, provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains. Over the past three years, the residential housing 
market in particular has benefited from a low interest rate environment and tight housing market conditions across the country, and that trend is expected to continue in 2022.
Additional information about the Company’s sales to the industrial markets is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K. 
Strategic Acquisitions
The Company is focused on driving growth in its primary markets through the acquisition of companies with strong management teams having a strategic fit with Patrick’s core values, business model and customer presence, as well as additional product lines, facilities, or other assets to complement or expand its existing businesses. The Company may explore strategic acquisition opportunities that are not directly tied to the four primary markets it serves in order to further leverage its core competencies in manufacturing and distribution and to diversify its end market exposure and presence.
In 2021, the Company invested approximately $520 million in acquisitions and over the last three years has completed approximately $880 million of acquisitions. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further discussion of acquisitions completed by the Company in 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
Competition
The RV, marine, MH and industrial markets are highly competitive, both among manufacturers and the suppliers of various components. The barriers to entry for each industry are generally low and include compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers of manufactured homes with vertically integrated operations. Across the Company’s range of products and services, competition exists primarily on price, product features and innovation, timely and reliable delivery, quality and customer service. Several competitors compete with Patrick in each product line on a regional and local basis. However, in order for a competitor to compete with Patrick on a national basis, the Company believes that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel and facilities would be required. 
Capacity and Plant Expansions
Patrick has the ability to fulfill demand for certain products in excess of capacity at certain facilities by shifting production to other facilities. Capital expenditures for 2021 consisted of $64.8 million of investments primarily to provide more advanced manufacturing automation, replace and upgrade production equipment, expand facilities outside of core Midwest markets to align with OEM expansions, and increase capacity to meet consumer needs and trends. Management regularly monitors capacity at its facilities and reallocates existing resources where needed to maintain production efficiencies throughout all of its operations and capitalize on commercial and industrial synergies in key regions to support profitable growth, grow its customer base, and expand its geographical product reach outside its core Midwest market. 
Branding
New product development is a key component of the Company’s efforts to grow its market share and revenue base, adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively address customer demand. The Company has expanded its product and service offerings with the integration of new and innovative product lines into its operations that bring additional value to customers and create additional scale advantages. 
The Studio
The Company's Design/Innovation Center and Showroom, The Studio, is located in Elkhart, Indiana. The Studio presents the latest design trends and products in the markets served by Patrick, and provides a creative environment for customers to design products and enhance their brand. The 45,000 square foot facility includes a 25,000 square foot showroom devoted to the display of products, capabilities and services offered by each of Patrick’s business units, in addition to offices and conference rooms. The Company’s specialized team of designers, engineers and graphic artists works with RV, marine, MH and industrial customers to meet their creative design and product needs, including creating new styles and utilizing new colors, patterns, products, and materials for panels and mouldings, cabinet doors, furniture, lighting and other products. Other services provided at The Studio include product development, 3D CAD illustration, 3D printing, photography and marketing. 
Marine Studio
The Company's Marine Studio, which was opened in February 2020 and is located in Sarasota, Florida, is a comprehensive marine studio showroom, design and engineering center, which provides engineering and integrated design solutions for our marine customers. The 14,000 square foot facility includes a showroom that displays the Company's marine products as well as the marine design and engineering capabilities and services offered by our marine businesses. 
Operating Brands
Through its operating brands, the Company provides customers with specific product knowledge, expertise and support that are tailored to their needs. The Company strives to be the supplier of choice for its customers by elevating the customer purchasing experience with expert product line managers, and support staff and strategic partnerships for each operating brand, which help drive efficiency and maximize value for its customers.
Patrick has no material licenses, franchises, or concessions and does not conduct material research and development activities.
Marketing and Distribution
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had over 3,700 active customers. Its revenues from the RV market include sales to two major manufacturers of RVs that each account for over 10% of the Company's net sales, Forest River and Thor. Both Forest River and Thor have multiple businesses and brands that operate independently under the parent company and these multiple businesses and brands generally purchase our products independently from one another. The Company’s sales to the various businesses of Forest River and Thor, on a combined basis, accounted for 42%, 39% and 40% of our consolidated net sales, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company generally maintains supplies of various commodity products in its warehouses to ensure that it has product on hand at all times for its distribution customers. The Company purchases a majority of its distribution segment products in railcar, container, or truckload quantities, which are warehoused prior to their sale to customers. Approximately 8%, 12%, and 12% of the Company's distribution segment’s sales were from products shipped directly from the suppliers to Patrick customers in 2021, 2020, 2019, respectively. Typically, there is a two to four-week period between Patrick receiving a purchase order and the delivery of products to its warehouses or customers and, as a result, the Company has no material backlog of orders. However, this can fluctuate depending on overall market factors and each specific end market we serve. In periods of declining market conditions, customer order rates can decline, resulting in less efficient logistics planning and fulfillment and thus increasing delivery costs due to increased numbers of shipments with fewer products in each shipment. 
Raw Materials
Patrick has arrangements with certain suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain geographic areas, pricing structures and rebate agreements among other terms. 
Raw materials are primarily commodity products, such as lauan, gypsum, particleboard and other softwood and hardwood lumber products, aluminum, copper, plastic resin, fiberglass and overlays, among others which are available from many suppliers. Our customers do not maintain long-term supply contracts, and therefore, the Company bears the risk of accurate forecasting of customer orders. Our sales in the short-term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major suppliers. In addition, demand changes in certain market sectors can result in fluctuating costs of certain more commodity-oriented raw materials and other products that are utilized and distributed. 
As a result of COVID-19 and other factors, the supply chain has been impacted by increasing commodity prices as well as increasing lead times and transportation costs, which has resulted in increased raw material pricing from several of our suppliers. Patrick has taken steps to mitigate these supply chain constraints by carrying increased levels of inventory and partnering with suppliers to help secure adequate supplies of materials. Additionally, the Company continually explores alternative sources of raw materials and components, both domestically and from outside the U.S. Alternate sources of supply are available for all of its material purchases. 
Regulation and Environmental Quality
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities including requirements relating to air, water, land and noise pollution. Additionally, these requirements regulate the Company's use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used or generated during specific manufacturing processes.
Select products are subject to various legally binding or voluntary standards. For example, the composite wood substrate materials that Patrick utilizes in the production process in the RV marketplace have been certified as to compliance with applicable emission standards developed by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). All suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current CARB regulations.
The Company is certified to sell Forestry Stewardship Council (“FSC”) materials to its customers at certain of its manufacturing branches. The FSC certification provides a link between responsible production and consumption of materials from the world’s forests and assists the Company’s customers in making socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions on the products they purchase. Upholstered products and mattresses provided by the Company for RVs must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding flammability.
The Company also produces and provides products for manufactured homes that must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).
Seasonality
Manufacturing operations in the RV, marine and MH industries historically have been seasonal and at their highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits had generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. Seasonal industry trends in the past several years have included the impact related to the addition of major RV manufacturer open houses for dealers in the August-September timeframe and marine open houses in the December-February timeframe, resulting in dealers delaying certain restocking purchases until new product lines are introduced at these shows. In addition, recent seasonal industry trends have been, and future trends may be, different than in prior years due to the impact of COVID-19, volatile economic conditions, interest rates, access to financing, cost of fuel, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and marine units and other products for which the Company sells its components, as well as fluctuations in RV and marine dealer inventories, increased volatility in demand from RV and marine dealers, the timing of dealer orders, and from time to time, the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide wholesale shipments.
Human Capital Management
Our people are the heart of our business, and we allocate substantial resources to foster the well-being, success and growth of our team members in an inclusive and diverse environment which we believe is fundamental to our values and our service to our customers. At December 31, 2021, our team members totaled approximately 11,000, of which 85% are hourly team members who serve our customers by producing and distributing products in our RV, marine, MH and industrial end markets, and 15% who are salaried employees who manage the resources, capital allocations, business decisions, and customer relationships of our end markets. 
The majority of our team members work in our facilities to produce or distribute products for our customers. Our investment in human capital resources focuses on this environment to ensure their well-being and success. Our primary commitment to our team members in the production environment is to their safety, well-being and progress, and in this regard our human capital management programs focus on the following, in addition to our health care insurance and other employment benefits:
•Free assistance programs available to all team members and their families to address mental health and others matters which arise, which we believe are essential during the unique pressures and uncertainties during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
•Tuition reimbursement programs available to all team members as they pursue educational opportunities;
•Leadership programs available to all employees that are designed to foster leadership and communication skills to advance team members to the next stage of their careers;
•Job safety analysis, which identifies risks unique to each production environment, training and empowering our team members to mitigate risks and develop workplace best practices;
•OSHA preparedness, which involves site specific training development to educate and enable our team members to work safely and effectively;
•Industrial hygiene audits and testing, ensuring that our team members work in healthy environments with respect to air quality and noise reduction;
•Machine guarding and work area audits, which identify mechanical and non-mechanical improvements in the safety and well-being of the production environment; 
•Train-the-trainer programs, which foster best-practice operational techniques for our team members to advance their capabilities to operate our facilities in the safest and most effective manner;
•Site-specific training development, which tailors customized training and consulting to the unique needs of the production environment;
•Ergonomic assessments for all team members, which accommodate each individual to work in the most effective and comfortable manner;
•Patrick Connect, our social media platform to share ongoing events, communicate leadership messages, share success stories, and provide a platform of mutual communication; and
•Community involvement initiatives, such as our participation in Military Makeover and Care Camps, which provides our team members opportunities to give back to the communities in which we do business. 
Our success is dependent on our ability to hire, retain, and engage highly qualified team members who serve our customers. In this regard, we aspire to be a merit-based organization that is inclusive and diverse, building a culture where our team members feel they belong. Our leadership development programs bring a diverse and energetic source of talent to lead the future of our organization, and our recruitment efforts strive to foster an inclusive culture that we believe strengthens our organization and our ability to serve our customers. 
The organization is built on our six core foundational values of being BETTER Together:
•Balance - We work to build a healthy work environment that encourages excellence, happiness, and peace in both our work and our home life.
•Excellence - We strive to meet the highest possible standards of achievement in our work and our relationships.
•Trust - We do what we say we will do every time - and communicate with all stakeholders if a commitment evolves.
•Teamwork - We challenge, encourage, equip, empower, and inspire the individuals we work with.
•Empowerment - We give our team the information, tools, and trust they need to grow as leaders and achieve results.
•Respect - We treat our teammates and partners with the utmost honor and dignity.
