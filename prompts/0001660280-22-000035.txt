Overview
We are a leading provider of Cyber Exposure solutions. Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing, measuring and comparing cybersecurity risk in the digital era.
Digital transformation is driving radical change and is powering the economy and our social infrastructure. A digital-first economy is only sustainable if it is built with a solid cybersecurity foundation. As organizations modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt cloud or hybrid cloud architectures that are no longer housed in the confines of their traditional on-premise IT networks, they have less visibility and control over the security of these assets. Organizations are also increasingly implementing modern solutions, such as Cloud, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, Mobility, Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, digital identity, web applications and application containers, to enable the rapid development and deployment of new products, services and business models, as well as to drive operational efficiencies. Further, safety-critical Operational Technology, or OT, such as Industrial Control Systems, are now network-connected and must be secured from cybersecurity threats. As organizations implement these modern solutions, they significantly expand their cyber attack surface. 
While other functions in an organization, such as finance and operations, have systems to help them manage and measure risk, cybersecurity risk has not historically been adequately measured or understood. We are building on our deep technology expertise as a pioneer in the vulnerability assessment and management market to provide broad visibility across the modern attack surface and deep insights to help security teams, executives and boards of directors prioritize and measure Cyber Exposure. We believe our Cyber Exposure solutions are transforming how cybersecurity risk is managed and measured and will help organizations more rapidly embrace digital transformation.
In 2021, 2020 and 2019 our total revenue was $541.1 million, $440.2 million and $354.6 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 23% from 2020 to 2021 and 24% from 2019 to 2020. Our net loss was $46.7 million, $42.7 million and $99.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cash flows from operating activities were $96.8 million, $64.2 million and $(10.7) million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our Enterprise Platform Offerings
Our enterprise platform enables organizations to answer foundational and strategic questions such as:
•Where are we exposed?
•Where should we prioritize remediation based on risk?
•Are we reducing our exposure over time?
•How do we compare to our peers?
We have continued to expand and diversify our platform offerings from traditional vulnerability management (VM) solutions, which include Tenable.sc and Nessus, to our cloud exposure solutions, which include Tenable.ep, Tenable.io, Tenable.cs, Tenable Web Scanning, or Tenable.io WAS, Tenable.ad and Tenable.ot. Our platform offerings provide broad visibility into security issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, internal and regulatory compliance violations and other indicators of the state of an organization’s security across IT infrastructure and applications, cloud environments, DevOps environments, Active Directory and Identity environments, and Industrial IoT and OT environments. We also provide deep analytics to help organizations score, trend and compare their cyber exposure over time, and communicate cyber risk in business terms to make better strategic decisions. Our platform offerings integrate and analyze data from our native collectors alongside IT asset, vulnerability and threat data from third-party systems and applications to prioritize security issues for remediation and focus an organization’s resources based on risk and business criticality. 
Tenable.ep is our unified platform that helps organizations identify, assess and accurately prioritize cyber risks across the entire attack surface. In addition to streamlining risk-based vulnerability management, Tenable.ep delivers deep business insights that empower organizations to calculate, communicate and compare their cyber risk exposure over time with that of their industry peers.

Our enterprise platform offerings deliver the following capabilities:
•Live asset discovery. We can automatically discover a broad range of traditional and modern IT assets, including on-premises infrastructure, web applications, cloud environments, mobile devices, containers, IoT devices and OT systems. We use a combination of active scanning, passive network monitoring and public cloud monitoring via our connectors to identify known and unknown assets on the network.
•Automated exposure assessment. With every change in a customer’s computing environment, we can automatically assess and identify where there are vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations and misconfigurations across assets and cloud environments, such as missing software patches or outdated software versions. In addition, we can help optimize existing security technology investments to identify indicators of cyber exposure, such as improperly configured anti-virus software.
•Deep analytics to allow for prioritization. We combine our product, vulnerability data and threat intelligence with third-party data to provide business context and enable organizations to prioritize remediation efforts based on the business criticality of the asset and the likelihood of exploit. Predictive Prioritization enables organizations to reduce business risk by focusing on the vulnerabilities with the greatest likelihood of imminently being exploited. It combines Tenable vulnerability data with third-party threat and vulnerability data across more than 150 data sources using a proprietary machine learning algorithm developed by Tenable Research and data science teams to provide clear guidance on where to focus remediation efforts. Predictive Prioritization provides a threat-based view of vulnerabilities, which is a critical component of modern risk-based vulnerability management.

Government Regulation
Various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have legislation pending that could affect our business.
In the ordinary course of our business, we process personal information. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, the Colorado Privacy Act, Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or EU GDPR, the EU GDPR as it forms part of the United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018, or UK GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive.
The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal information. The EU GDPR applies to companies established in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal information in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of individuals in the EEA. The EU GDPR includes stringent and complex obligations on entities that receive or process personal information, along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for individuals, and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. In addition, the EU GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal information from locations in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws and imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of consolidated annual worldwide gross revenue). Similarly, the CCPA imposes many obligations on covered businesses, including to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal information and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal information (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal information processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal information, and to opt out of certain personal information disclosures). The CCPA provides for civil penalties (up to $7,500 per violation) and has a private cause of action for data breaches.
Like other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products are subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the United States with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,617 employees, including 635 employees located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in connection with local labor laws. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe in upholding a core set of values for our entire global workforce:
•One Tenable: We are united as one Tenable team. We win together. We are one team internally, with our customers, with our partners and in the market.
