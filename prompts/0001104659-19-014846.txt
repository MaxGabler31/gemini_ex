ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
General
 
Hanger, Inc. (the Company, we, our, or us) is a leading national provider of products and services that assist in enhancing or restoring the physical capabilities of patients with disabilities or injuries.  Built on the legacy of James Edward Hanger, the first amputee of the American Civil War, we and our predecessor companies have provided orthotic and prosthetic (O&P) services for over 150 years.  We provide O&P services, distribute O&P devices and components, manage O&P networks, and provide therapeutic solutions to patients and businesses in acute, post-acute, and clinic settings.  We operate through two segments - Patient Care and Products & Services.
 
Our Patient Care segment is primarily comprised of Hanger Clinic, which specializes in the design, fabrication, and delivery of custom O&P devices through 676 patient care clinics and 104 satellite locations in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as of December 31, 2018.  We also provide payor network contracting services to other O&P providers through this segment.
 
Our Products & Services segment is comprised of our distribution and therapeutic solutions businesses.  As a leading provider of O&P products in the United States, we coordinate through our distribution business the procurement and distribution of a broad catalog of O&P parts, componentry, and devices to independent O&P providers nationwide.  To facilitate speed and convenience, we deliver these products through our five distribution facilities that are located in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The other business in our Products & Services segment is our therapeutic solutions business, which provides specialized rehabilitation technologies and evidence-based clinical programs for post-acute rehabilitation patients at approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our net revenues were $1,048.8 million, $1,040.8 million, and $1,042.1 million, respectively.  We recorded a net loss from continuing operations of $0.9 million, $104.7 million, and $107.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 
The following table summarizes the percentage of net revenues derived from each of our two operating segments:
 

 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
----------------------+----------------------------------+--
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Patient Care | 81.8 | % | 81.9 | % | 80.6 | %
Products & Services | 18.2 | % | 18.1 | % | 19.4 | %

 
See Note S - Segment and Related Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our segments.
 
Industry Overview
 
We estimate that approximately $4.2 billion is spent in the United States each year for prescription-based O&P products and services through O&P clinics.  Orthotic devices, or orthoses are externally applied devices used to modify the structural and functional characteristics of the neuromuscular and skeletal system.  These devices typically are provided to patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders, such as ailments of the back, extremities, or joints; injuries from sports; or conditions such as cerebral palsy, scoliosis, and stroke.  Prosthetic devices, or prostheses, are artificial devices that replace a missing limb or portion of a limb.  These devices are provided to patients with amputated or congenitally absent limbs to replace the function and appearance of a limb so that patients can resume activities of daily living and work.  The most prevalent causes for amputations are from complications due to diabetes, trauma associated with accidents, physical injury, or infection.

The industry derives its primary revenue from the evaluation, fabrication, and fitting of custom O&P devices to serve patients needing both new and replacement devices.  Additionally, O&P clinics typically provide patients with other non-custom orthotic products, diabetic shoes and inserts, and support patients through the repair and adjustment of their devices.
 
We believe our Patient Care segment currently serves approximately 20% of the O&P clinic market.  We estimate that the next largest provider of O&P services in the United States is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA), which operates 79 O&P clinics on behalf of its covered veteran patients.  In addition to serving veterans through their own facilities, in certain markets the VA is also a client of Hanger Clinic.  Approximately 9% of Hanger Clinics revenue is derived from services provided to veteran patients through contracts with the VA.
 
The O&P patient care market is highly fragmented and is typically characterized by regional and local independent O&P businesses. We estimate that our top ten competitors have an average of approximately 27 clinics each, with the smallest having 21 and the largest having 44 clinics.  The remainder of the market is served by individual practitioners and smaller regional or market-based firms with approximately twenty or fewer clinics.  Based on this, we do not believe that any single competitor accounts for more than approximately 2% of the nations total estimated O&P clinic revenues.
 
We anticipate that the demand for O&P services will continue to grow as the nations population increases, and as a result of several trends, including the aging of the U.S. population, there will be an increase in the prevalence of disease-related disability and the demand for new and advanced devices.  We believe the typical replacement time for prosthetic devices is three to five years, while the typical replacement time for orthotic devices varies, depending on the device.
 
We estimate that approximately $1.7 billion is spent in the United States each year by providers of O&P patient care services for the O&P products, components, devices, and supplies used in their businesses.  Our Products & Services segment distributes to independent providers of O&P services and to our own patient care clinics.  We estimate that our distribution sales account for approximately 8% of the market for O&P products, components, devices, and supplies (excluding sales to our Patient Care segment).
 
We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, integrated clinical programs, and therapist training in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to be approximately $150 million annually.  We currently provide these products and services to approximately 24% of the estimated 15,000 SNFs located in the U.S.  We estimate the market for rehabilitation technologies, clinical programs, and training within the broader post-acute rehabilitation markets to be approximately $400 million annually.  We do not currently provide a meaningful amount of products and services to this broader market.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to be the provider of choice for patients, referring physicians, and customers seeking products and services that enhance human physical capabilities.  Our strategy is to pursue the creation of an integrated therapeutic solutions model that will have a strong focus in custom O&P and immediately adjacent markets to provide our patients and customers with a spectrum of services that address their individual needs.  To foster growth, we intend to focus on initiatives that will differentiate Hanger from our competitors.
 
Government-led health care reform is driving significant changes to our business environment, with focus on lowering health care costs while improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.  As a result, our strategy is focused on enhancing the quality of care to elevate patient satisfaction, investing in processes and technologies to measure and report on patient outcomes and connectedness, and further increasing our profile with referring health care providers and payors.  In addition, we are committed to reducing the cost of this care by undertaking several initiatives that include establishing device standards that provide the highest function, durability, and comfort at the lowest cost, reconfiguring our supply chain and fabrication processes, streamlining internal administrative processes, and reducing back-office functions performed within patient care clinics.

Business Description
 
Patient Care
 
Our Patient Care segment employs approximately 1,500 clinical prosthetists, orthotists, and pedorthists, which we refer to as clinicians, substantially all of which are certified by either the American Board for Certification (ABC) or the Board of Certification of Orthotists and Prosthetists, which are the two boards that certify O&P clinicians.  To facilitate timely service to our patients, we also employ technicians, fitters, and other ancillary providers to assist its clinicians in the performance of their duties.  Through this segment, we additionally provide network contracting services to independent providers of O&P through our Linkia business.
 
Patients are typically referred to Hanger Clinic by an attending physician who determines a patients treatment and writes a prescription.  Our clinicians then consult with both the referring physician and the patient with a view toward assisting in the design of an orthotic or prosthetic device to meet the patients needs.  O&P devices are increasingly technologically advanced and custom designed to add functionality and comfort to patients lives, shorten the rehabilitation process, and lower the cost of rehabilitation.
 
Based on the prescription written by a referring physician, our clinicians examine and evaluate the patient and either design a custom device or, in the case of certain orthotic needs, utilize a non-custom device, including, in appropriate circumstances, an off the shelf device, to address the patients needs.  When fabricating a device, our clinicians ascertain the specific requirements, componentry, and measurements necessary for the construction of the device.  Custom devices are constructed using componentry provided by a variety of third party manufacturers who specialize in O&P, coupled with sockets and other elements that are fabricated by our clinicians and technicians, to meet the individual patients physical and ambulatory needs.  Our clinicians and technicians typically utilize castings, electronic scans, and other techniques to fabricate items that are specialized for the patient.  After fabricating the device, a fitting process is undertaken and adjustments are made to ensure the achievement of proper alignment, fit, and patient comfort.  The fitting process often involves several stages to successfully achieve desired functional and cosmetic results.
 
Given the differing physical weight and size characteristics, location of injury or amputation, capability for physical activity and mobility, cosmetic, and other needs of each individual patient, each fabricated prosthesis and orthosis is customized for each particular patient.  These custom devices are commonly fabricated at one of our regional or national fabrication facilities.
 
We have earned a reputation within the O&P industry for the development and use of innovative technology in our products, which has increased patient comfort and capability and can significantly enhance the rehabilitation process.  Frequently, our Insignia scanning system is used in the fabrication process.  The Insignia system scans the patient and produces an accurate computer generated image, resulting in a faster turnaround for the patients device and a more professional overall experience.
 
In recent years, we have established a centralized revenue cycle management organization that assists our clinics in pre-authorization, patient eligibility, denial management, collections, payor audit coordination, and other accounts receivable processes.
 
The principal reimbursement sources for our services are:
 
·                  Commercial private payors and other non-governmental organizations, which consist of individuals, rehabilitation providers, commercial insurance companies, health management organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), hospitals, vocational rehabilitation centers, workers compensation programs, third party administrators, and similar sources;
 
·                  Medicare, a federally funded health insurance program providing health insurance coverage for persons aged 65 or older and certain disabled persons;
 
3




·                  Medicaid, a health insurance program jointly funded by federal and state governments providing health insurance coverage for certain persons based upon financial need, regardless of age, which may supplement Medicare benefits for financially needy persons aged 65 or older; and
 
·                  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
 
We typically enter into contracts with third party payors that allow us to perform O&P services for a referred patient and to be paid under the contract with the third party payor.  These contracts usually have a stated term of one to three years.  These contracts generally may be terminated without cause by either party on 60 to 90 days notice or on 30 days notice if we have not complied with certain licensing, certification, program standards, Medicare or Medicaid requirements, or other regulatory requirements.  Reimbursement for services is typically based on a fee schedule negotiated with the third party payor that reflects various factors, including market conditions, geographic area, and number of persons covered.  Many of our commercial contracts are indexed to the commensurate Medicare fee schedule that relates to the products or services being provided.
 
Government reimbursement, comprised of Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately, 56.5%, 54.8%, and 54.1% of our net revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  These payors set maximum reimbursement levels for O&P services and products.  Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment.  The CPI-U is adjusted further by an efficiency factor (the Productivity Adjustment) in order to determine the final rate adjustment each year.  The Medicare price adjustments for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 1.1%, 0.7%, and (0.4%) respectively.  There can be no assurance that future adjustments will not reduce reimbursements for O&P services and products from these sources.
 
We, and the O&P industry in general, are subject to various Medicare compliance audits, including Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC) audits, Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) audits, Targeted Probe and Educate (TPE) audits, and Zone Program Integrity Contractor (ZPIC) audits.  TPE audits are generally pre-payment audits, while RAC, CERT, and ZPIC audits are generally post-payment audits.  The recently implemented TPE audits have replaced the previous Medicare Administrative Contractor audits.  Adverse post-payment audit determinations generally require Hanger to reimburse Medicare for payments previously made, while adverse pre-payment audit determinations generally result in the denial of payment.  In either case, we can request a redetermination or appeal if we believe the adverse determination is unwarranted, which can take an extensive period of time to resolve, currently up to six years or more.
 
Products & Services
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Prosthetic Supply, Inc. (SPS), we distribute O&P components to independent providers of O&P and other customers.  This componentry is provided by our supply chain operations, through which we procure, warehouse, and distribute over 400,000 SKUs from more than 300 different manufacturers.  Our warehousing and distribution facilities in Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas, are able to deliver products to the majority of our customers in the United States within two business days.  Through its SureFit subsidiary, SPS also manufactures and sells therapeutic footwear for diabetic patients in the podiatric market.
 
Our supply chain operations are an internal support organization that serves both SPS and our Patient Care clinics by procuring, warehousing, and distributing componentry.  This organization enables us to:
 
·                  centralize our purchasing and thus lower our material costs by negotiating purchasing discounts from manufacturers;
 
·                  ensure patient care clinics use vendors that have met or exceeded our Hanger Clinic standards for clinical products;
 
4




·                  better manage our patient care clinic inventory levels;
 
·                  centralize quality control over inventory;
 
·                  encourage our patient care clinics to use the most clinically appropriate products; and
 
·                  coordinate new product development efforts with key vendors.
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Accelerated Care Plus Corp. and Accelerated Care Plus Leasing, Inc. (together, ACP), our therapeutic solutions business is a leading provider of rehabilitation technologies and integrated clinical programs to skilled nursing and post-acute rehabilitation providers.  Our unique value proposition is to provide our customers with a full-service total solutions approach encompassing proven medical technology, evidence based clinical programs, and ongoing consultative education and training.  Our services support increasingly advanced treatment options for a broader patient population and more medically complex conditions.  We serve approximately 3,900 skilled nursing and post-acute providers nationwide.
 
Competition
 
The business of providing O&P patient care services is highly competitive in the markets in which we operate.  In the prosthetic business, we compete with local independent O&P providers for referrals from physicians, therapists, employers, HMOs, PPOs, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, out-patient clinics, and insurance companies on both a local and regional basis.  In the orthotic business, we compete with other patient care service providers, including device manufacturers that have independent sales forces, on the basis of quality and timeliness of patient care, location of patient care clinics, and pricing for services.  Additionally, an international O&P product manufacturer owns a small O&P patient care services business in the United States.
 
Although we serve a significant portion of the O&P patient care market, referral decisions made by surgeons, physicians, and other medical providers are generally made on a local basis, based on their individual evaluation of the relative quality of care provided by us and our local market competitors.  Therefore, our national scale may not provide a competitive advantage in any particular market in which we operate.
 
We also compete with independent O&P providers for the retention and recruitment of qualified O&P clinicians.  In some markets, the demand for clinicians exceeds the supply of qualified personnel.
 
Our Products & Services segment competes with other distributors, manufacturers who sell their products directly, and providers of equipment and services on a regional and national basis that have similar sales forces and products.  Some of our distributor competitors are also dedicated to the O&P industry, but many others are large medical product distributors who also distribute O&P products, particularly orthotic products.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the combination of the following competitive strengths will help us to grow our businesses by increasing our net revenues, net income and market share:
 
·                  Leading market position in both the O&P market place and the post-acute rehabilitation markets;
 
·                  National scale of operations, which better enables us to:
 
·                  establish our brand name and generate economies of scale;
 
5




·                  identify and implement best practices throughout our organization;
 
·                  consistently apply the rigorous claims documentation standards required for reimbursement and facilitate reimbursement through a revenue cycle management organization;
 
·                  collect, aggregate, and publish our statistically significant clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction data and metrics;
 
·                  offer a single network solution to national and regional shared fabrication facilities;
 
·                  identify, test and deploy emerging technology; and
 
·                  increase our influence on, and input into, regulatory trends;
 
·                  Distribution of, and purchasing power for, O&P components and finished O&P products, which better enables us to:
 
·                  negotiate greater purchasing discounts from manufacturers and freight providers;
 
·                  manage Hanger Clinic inventory levels on a national scale through centralized purchasing controls;
 
·                  access prefabricated and finished O&P products;
 
·                  promote the usage by our patient care clinics of products that have met or exceeded Hanger Clinic standards of quality and patient care that also enhance our profit margins; and
 
·                  expand the external client base of the distribution business in our Products & Services segment;
 
·                  Proven ability to rapidly incorporate technological advances in the fitting and fabrication of O&P devices;
 
·                  History of integrating small and medium sized O&P business acquisitions, including 139 O&P businesses between 1997 and 2015, representing over 365 patient care clinics, and two O&P businesses with two patient care clinics in the fourth quarter of 2018;
 
·                  Highly trained clinicians, whom we provide with the highest level of continuing education and training through programs designed to inform them of the latest technological developments in the O&P industry;
 
·                  Experienced and committed management team; and
 
·                  Beneficial government relations efforts, which enable us to educate legislators on the medical benefits and cost effectiveness of O&P services.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase prefabricated O&P devices, components, and materials from hundreds of suppliers across the country, which are utilized by our clinicians and technicians in the fabrication of O&P products.  These devices, components, and materials are used in the products we offer in our patient care clinics throughout the United States.  As of December 31, 2018, one supplier accounted for 10% or more of our annual purchases, representing 10.8%.

Sales and Marketing
 
In our Patient Care segment, primarily through their interaction with and provision of prosthetic or orthotic services to the patients of referring surgeons, physicians, and other providers, our individual clinicians in local patient care clinics historically have conducted our sales and marketing efforts.  Due primarily to the fragmented nature of the O&P industry, the success of a particular patient care clinic has been largely a function of its local reputation for quality of care, responsiveness, and length of service in the local communities.
 
To augment the efforts of the business segment personnel, we have developed a centralized sales and marketing department whose efforts target the following:
 
·                  Marketing and Public Relations.  Our objective is to increase the visibility of the Hanger brand by building relationships with major referral sources.  We also continue to explore creating alliances with certain vendors to market products and services on a nationwide basis.
·                  Business Development.  We have dedicated personnel in most of our operating regions who are responsible for arranging seminars, clinics, and forums to educate and consult with patients and to increase the local communitys awareness of the Hanger brand.  These business development managers also meet with local referral and contract sources to help our clinicians develop new relationships in their markets.
·                  Insurance Contracts.  Our specialty health care company, Linkia, works with national insurance companies to help manage their O&P networks.  Linkia is a network management organization dedicated solely to the O&P industry to improve the interface between payors and O&P providers by simplifying network management and administration, in-depth industry expertise, and scalability to payors.
 
Marketing of our services is conducted on a national basis through a dedicated sales force, print and e-commerce catalogs, and exhibits at industry and medical meetings and conventions.  We use directed marketing to segments of the health care industry, such as orthopedic surgeons, vascular surgeons, physical and occupational therapists, patient care managers, and podiatrists, by providing specialized catalogs focused on their medical specialty.
 
In our Products & Services segment, we employ dedicated sales professionals that call on independent O&P providers and are generally responsible for a geographic region or specific product line.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our strategy is to achieve long-term growth through disciplined diversification of our revenue streams, including geographic expansion or the broadening of our continuum of care through the acquisitions of high quality O&P providers. One of the primary drivers in executing our acquisition strategy is expanding our ability to serve new patients in new geographic markets.
 
Once an acquisition is consummated, we integrate and generally centralize certain key functions including IT, marketing, sales, finance, and administration to ensure that we can optimize cross-selling opportunities and realize cost efficiencies.
 
In certain of our historical acquisitions, in addition to cash paid at closing, the purchase price has included unsecured subordinated promissory notes (Seller Notes) and contingent consideration terms (earnouts) associated with the achievement of certain designated collection targets for the acquired business.  Earnouts can be used to compromise between our valuation and sellers expectations regarding purchase price, while providing protection from our overpayment if historical collections are not an accurate indicator of post-closing financial performance of the acquired business.
 
7




Our evaluation of the acquired business is based on various factors, including specialized know-how, reputation, geographic coverage, competitive position, and service and product offerings, as well as our experience and judgment.
 
Acquisition Activity
 
Prior to September 30, 2018, we had not completed any acquisitions since early 2015 due to the necessity of utilizing available operating cash flow to fund accounting, legal, and other professional fees in connection with the preparation and review of our financial statements, efforts to remediate our material weaknesses, related legal matters, and due to the effect of our prior non-compliance (under the terms of previously existing debt instruments) with certain of our debt covenants relating to our failure to meet financial statement reporting requirements.  In connection with refinancing of our debt in 2018, and the resolution of the primary factors which led us to halt our acquisitions, we have recommenced acquisitions of O&P businesses similar to those that we have consummated in prior years.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, we concluded the acquisition of two O&P clinics similar to those that we operate through our Patient Care segment for a combined purchase price of $3.1 million, of which $2.0 million was cash consideration and $1.1 million was issued in an unsecured note to the seller.  We do not believe the acquisitions undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2018 have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Government Regulation
 
The operations of our business are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local governmental regulations.  We make every effort to comply with all applicable regulations through compliance programs, policies and procedures, manuals, and personnel training.  Despite these efforts, we cannot guarantee that we will be in absolute compliance with all regulations at all times.  Failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations may result in significant penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
Fraud and Abuse.  Violations of fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, False Claims Act liability (discussed below), imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, VA health programs, and the Department of Defenses TRICARE program, formerly known as CHAMPUS.  These laws, which include but are not limited to federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, physician self-referral laws, and federal criminal health care fraud laws, are discussed in further detail below.  We believe our billing practices, operations, and compensation and financial arrangements with referral sources and others materially comply with applicable federal and state requirements.  However, we cannot assure that such requirements will always be interpreted by a governmental authority in a manner consistent with our interpretation and application.  The failure to comply, even if inadvertent, with any of these requirements could require us to alter our operations with and/or refund payments to the government.  Such refunds could be significant and could also lead to the imposition of significant penalties.  Even if we successfully defend against any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, we would likely be forced to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business.  Any of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
 
Anti-Kickback Laws.  Our operations are subject to federal and state anti-kickback laws.  The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in any form (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) in return for, or to induce, the referral of persons eligible for benefits under a federal health care program (including Medicare, Medicaid, the VA health programs, and TRICARE), or the ordering, purchasing, leasing, or arranging for, or the recommendation of purchasing, leasing, or ordering of, items or services that may be paid for, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program.  Courts have held that the statute may be violated when even one purpose (as opposed to a primary or sole purpose) of the remuneration is to induce referrals or other business.
 
8




Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit beneficial commercial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services has developed regulations addressing certain business arrangements that will offer protection from scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute.  These Safe Harbors describe activities which may be protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided that they meet all of the requirements of the applicable Safe Harbor regulation.  For example, the Safe Harbors cover activities such as offering discounts to health care providers and contracting with physicians or other individuals or entities that have the potential to refer business to us that would ultimately be billed to a federal health care program, so long as the discount is properly disclosed and appropriately reflected in any claims or charges.
 
Failure to qualify for Safe Harbor protection does not automatically mean that an arrangement is illegal.  Rather, the facts and circumstances of the arrangement must be analyzed to determine whether there is improper intent to pay or receive remuneration in return for referrals.  Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of the Safe Harbors may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.  In addition, some states have anti-kickback laws that vary in scope and may apply regardless of whether a federal health care program is involved.
 
Our operations and business arrangements include, for example, discount programs or other financial arrangements with individuals and entities, such as lease arrangements with hospitals and certain participation agreements.  Therefore, our operations and business arrangements are required to comply with the anti-kickback laws.  Although our business arrangements and operations may not always satisfy all the criteria of a Safe Harbor, we believe that our operations are in material compliance with federal and state anti-kickback statutes.  Nonetheless, we cannot ensure that the governments interpretation of a Safe Harbor provision will always be consistent with our own, and our arrangements may be subject to scrutiny under anti-kickback laws.  Noncompliance with such laws can result in a number of enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs.
 
Medical Device Regulation.  We provide, distribute, and lease products that are subject to regulation as medical devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and accompanying regulations.  In our Patient Care segment, with the exception of two products which have been cleared for marketing as prescription medical devices under section 510(k) of the FDCA, we believe that the products we provide, including O&P medical devices, accessories, and components, are not Class III devices and thus are exempt from the FDAs regulations for pre-market clearance or approval requirements and from most requirements relating to the quality system regulation (except for certain record keeping and complaint handling requirements).  In our Products & Services segment, ACP manufactures, leases, and sells a number of rehabilitation devices that have been cleared or approved for marketing under section 510(k) of the FDCA, and are subject to the requirements of the quality system regulation.  All of our device businesses are required to adhere to regulations for medical devices regarding adverse event reporting, establishment registration, and product listing, and we are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with all applicable requirements.  Labeling and promotional materials also are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.  Our medical device operations are subject to inspection by the FDA for compliance with applicable FDA requirements, and the FDA has in the past raised compliance concerns in connection with these investigations.  We have addressed these concerns and believe we are in compliance with applicable FDA requirements, but we cannot assure that we will be found to be in compliance at all times.  Non-compliance could result in a variety of civil and/or criminal enforcement actions, including issuance of a Warning Letter, seizure, examination, and inspection of our products and a civil injunction or criminal prosecution, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Physician Self-Referral Laws.  We are also subject to federal and state physician self-referral laws.  With certain exceptions, the federal Medicare physician self-referral law (the Stark Law) (Section 1877 of the Social Security Act) prohibits a physician from referring Medicare beneficiaries to an entity for designated health services including durable medical equipment and supplies, and prosthetic and orthotic devices and supplies, if the physician or the physicians immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity.  A financial relationship includes both ownership or investment interests and compensation arrangements.  An entity that furnishes designated health services pursuant to a prohibited referral may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill for such designated health services.  Penalties for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment for the service, an obligation to refund any payments received, civil monetary penalties, potential False Claims Act litigation, and the possibility of being excluded from the Medicare or Medicaid programs.

Despite the general prohibition on such physician financial relationships, the Stark Law does provide a number of exceptions from liability.  For example, with respect to ownership/investment interests, there is an exception under the Stark Law for referrals made to a publicly traded entity in which the physician or the physicians immediate family member has an investment interest if the entitys shares are generally available to the public at the time of the designated health service referral, and are traded on certain exchanges, including among others the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as well as over-the-counter quotation systems including the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (OTC) and/or the investment entity had shareholders equity exceeding $75.0 million for its most recent fiscal year or as an average during the three previous fiscal years.  We meet these tests and, therefore, believe that referrals from physicians who have ownership interests in our stock, or whose immediate family members have ownership interests in our stock, should not result in liability under the Stark Law.
 
With respect to compensation arrangements, there are exceptions under the Stark Law that permit physicians to maintain certain business arrangements, such as personal service contracts and equipment or space leases, with health care entities to which they refer patients for designated health services.  All of the elements of a Stark Law exception must be met in order for the exception to apply.  Further, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, under the Stark Law, liability can result without specific intent to induce referrals.  We believe that our compensation arrangements with physicians comply with the Stark Law, either because the physicians relationship fits fully within a Stark Law exception or because the physician does not generate prohibited referrals.  If, however, we receive a prohibited referral, our submission of a bill for services rendered pursuant to such a referral could subject us to sanctions under the Stark Law and applicable state self-referral laws, including false claims liability, potential exclusion, and imposition of civil monetary penalties.  State self-referral laws may extend the prohibitions of the Stark Law to Medicaid beneficiaries, and there are some indications that the federal government may similarly expand the reach of the law.
 
False Claims Laws.  We are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, are for items or services not provided as claimed, or otherwise contain misleading information.  Each of our patient care clinics is responsible for the preparation of documents for the submission of reimbursement claims to third party payors for items and services furnished to patients.  In addition, our personnel may, in some instances, provide advice on billing and reimbursement to purchasers of our products.  Also, prosecutors and so-called qui tam relators (whistleblowers) may claim that a regulatory violation or wrongfully-retained overpayment may be the basis of False Claims Act litigation.  Successful relators can receive a share of the recovery in a False Claims Act case ranging from 15% to 30%, depending on whether the government intervenes in the case.  Penalties in a False Claims Act case may include double or triple damages plus penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 per claim.  While we endeavor to assure that our billing practices comply with applicable laws, if claims submitted to payors are deemed to be false, fraudulent or for items or services not provided as claimed, we may face liability for presenting or causing to be presented such claims.
Certification and Licensure.  Our clinicians and/or certain operating units may be subject to certification or licensure requirements under the laws of some states.  Most states do not require separate licensure for clinicians.  However, several states currently require clinicians to be certified by an organization such as the ABC.  The ABC conducts a certification program for clinicians and an accreditation program for patient care clinics.  The minimum requirements for new certified clinicians are a college degree, completion of an accredited masters degree program, residency at a patient care clinic under the supervision of a certified clinician, and successful completion of certain examinations.  Certified clinicians are required to participate in a prescribed number of hours of specialized continuing education courses to maintain their certifications.  Minimum requirements for an accredited patient care clinic include the presence of a certified clinician and specific plant and equipment requirements.
 
While we endeavor to comply with all state licensure requirements, we cannot assure that we will be in compliance at all times with these requirements, or how they may be interpreted or re-interpreted by the various state and local agencies.  Failure to comply with state licensure requirements could result in suspension or termination of licensure, civil penalties, termination of our Medicare and Medicaid agreements, and repayment of amounts received from Medicare and Medicaid for services and supplies furnished by an unlicensed individual or entity.

HIPAA Violations.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides criminal penalties for, among other offenses: health care fraud; theft or embezzlement with respect to a health care benefit program; false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; and obstruction of criminal investigation of health care offenses.  Unlike other federal laws, these offenses are not limited to federal health care programs.
 
In addition, HIPAA authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties where a person offers or pays remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits under a federal health care program that such person knows or should know is likely to influence the individual to order or receive covered items or services from a particular provider, clinician, or supplier.  Excluded from the definition of remuneration are incentives given to individuals to promote the delivery of preventive care (excluding cash or cash equivalents), incentives of nominal value, and certain differentials in or waivers of coinsurance and deductible amounts.
 
These laws may apply to certain of our operations.  As noted above, we have established various types of discount programs and other financial arrangements with individuals and entities.  We also bill third party payors and other entities for items and services provided at our patient care clinics.  While we endeavor to ensure that our discount programs and other financial arrangements and billing practices comply with applicable laws, such programs, arrangements, and billing practices could be subject to scrutiny and challenge under HIPAA.
 
Confidentiality and Privacy Laws.  The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA, and their implementing regulations, set forth privacy standards and implementation specifications concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (referred to as protected health information) by health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that transmit health information electronically in connection with certain standard transactions (Covered Entities).  HIPAA further requires Covered Entities to protect the confidentiality of protected health information by meeting certain security standards and implementation specifications.  In addition, under HIPAA, Covered Entities that electronically transmit certain administrative and financial transactions must utilize standardized formats and data elements (the transactions/code sets standards).  HIPAA imposes civil monetary penalties for non-compliance, and, with respect to knowing violations of the privacy standards, or violations of such standards committed under false pretenses or with the intent to sell, transfer, or use protected health information for commercial advantage, criminal penalties.  Certain agents of Covered Entities (business associates) also have HIPAA responsibilities and liabilities.  We have business associates and are business associates to other Covered Entities.  We believe that we are subject to the Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and are taking steps to meet applicable standards and implementation specifications.  The new requirements have had a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health data and communicate with payors.
 
In addition, state confidentiality and privacy laws may impose civil and/or criminal penalties for certain unauthorized or other uses or disclosures of protected health information.  We are also subject to these laws.  While we endeavor to assure that our operations comply with applicable laws governing the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information, we could face liability in the event of a use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of one or more of these laws.
 
Personnel and Training
 
None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that we have satisfactory relationships with our approximately 4,600 employees and strive to maintain these relationships by offering competitive benefit packages, training programs, and opportunities for advancement.
 
We provide a series of ongoing training programs to improve the professional knowledge of our clinicians.  For example, we have an annual education fair that is attended by our clinicians, leaders, and other employees.  This annual meeting consists of lectures and seminars covering many clinical topics including the latest technology and process improvements, business courses, and other courses that allow the clinicians to fulfill their ongoing continuing education requirements.

Insurance
 
We currently maintain insurance coverage for professional liability, product liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, workers compensation, executive protection, property damage, and other lines of insurance.  Our general liability insurance coverage is $1.0 million per occurrence, with a $25.0 million umbrella insurance policy.  The coverage for professional liability, product liability, and workers compensation is self-insured with both individual specific claim and aggregate stop-loss policies to protect us from either significant individual claims or dramatic changes in our loss experience.  Based on our experience and prevailing industry practices, we believe our coverage is adequate as to risks and amount.
