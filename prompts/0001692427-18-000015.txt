 Overview
 ﻿
 NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (“NCS,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. We provide our products and services primarily to exploration and production (“E&P”) companies for use in onshore wells, predominantly wells that have been drilled with horizontal laterals in unconventional oil and natural gas formations. Our products and services are utilized in oil and natural gas basins throughout North America and in selected international markets, including Argentina, China and Russia. We provided our products and services to over 240 customers in 2017, including leading large independent oil and natural gas companies and major oil companies.
 ﻿
 Our primary offering is our Multistage Unlimited family of completion products and services, which enable efficient pinpoint stimulation: the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are typically utilized in cemented wellbores and enable our customers to precisely place stimulation treatments in a more controlled and repeatable manner as compared with traditional completion techniques. Our Multistage Unlimited products and services are utilized in conjunction with third-party providers of pressure pumping, coiled tubing and other services.
 ﻿

We began providing pinpoint stimulation products and services in 2006, and since then our technology has been used in the completion of more than 9,200 wells comprising over 195,000 individual frac stages. Our initial focus on the Canadian market has resulted in our products and services being used in 25% of all horizontal wells drilled in Canada in 2017. We began our efforts to increase our penetration of the U.S. market in 2013, and the United States accounted for approximately 32% and 23% of our revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We are focused on increasing our market share in the United States, particularly in the Permian Basin.
 ﻿
 Multistage Unlimited completion products and services include our casing-installed sliding sleeves and downhole frac isolation assembly. Customers typically purchase our casing-installed sliding sleeves, a consumable product that is cemented at intervals into the casing of the wellbore, and can also utilize services associated with our downhole frac isolation assembly. Our downhole frac isolation assembly is comprised of numerous subcomponents, including a resettable bridge plug for stage isolation, a sleeve locator to efficiently locate our sliding sleeves in the wellbore, an abrasive perforating sub that can perforate the casing where our sliding sleeves are not installed and gauge packages that can measure and record downhole data. Our personnel supervise the use of the downhole frac isolation assembly during completion operations. In addition, our downhole frac isolation assembly provides valuable downhole data, including recorded downhole temperatures and pressures, which can be analyzed and used in designing future completion strategies. Further, because our downhole frac isolation assembly is deployed on coiled tubing, our customers have access to real-time downhole pressure measurements which can be used to adjust strategies during a well completion. We offer two primary models of sliding sleeves: our GripShift sliding sleeves, which open one time, and our MultiCycle sliding sleeves, which can be opened and closed multiple times giving our customers the benefit of additional completion options and the ability to better optimize a well’s production phase. We hold 28 patents related to our technology and received the World Oil Best Completions Technology Award in 2014 and 2015 for our Multistage Unlimited products and services and MultiCycle sliding sleeves, respectively.
 ﻿
 We also offer chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics services through Spectrum Tracer Services, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Spectrum”). Our customers utilize these services to better characterize their assets and to optimize completion designs. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies may provide a cost-effective and reliable means to determine the production profile along a lateral, assess fluid and proppant communication between wells during completions and determine stage and cluster level efficiency of completion designs.
 ﻿
 We complement our proprietary products and services with our in-house expertise in completions engineering, reservoir engineering and geology. These capabilities allow us to engage with our customers on well completion design and well spacing decisions, thereby supporting our customers’ completion optimization strategies and building lasting relationships. In addition, our extensive research and development efforts are influenced and driven by the needs of our customers, allowing us to introduce innovative and commercial solutions that improve customer efficiency and profitability.
 ﻿
 Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $201.6 million, $98.5 million and $114.0 million, respectively. Our net income (loss) attributable to NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $2.1 million, $(17.9) million and $28.0 million, respectively.

 Products and Services 
 ﻿
 We provide highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies. Our key products and services include:
· | Multistage Unlimited. Our Multistage Unlimited family of products and services encompasses our technology developed to enable efficient pinpoint stimulation and re-stimulation strategies. Pinpoint stimulation is the process of individually stimulating each entry point into a formation targeted by an oil or natural gas well, a process that we believe improves on traditional completion techniques. Our pinpoint stimulation solutions and refined field processes are designed to enable efficient, controlled, verifiable and repeatable completions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Multistage Unlimited completion products and services are comprised of our casing-installed sliding sleeves and our downhole frac isolation assemblies, which are deployed using coiled tubing. Our services include advising customers on optimizing completion designs and operating the downhole frac isolation assemblies.

· | Casing-installed sliding sleeves. Our casing-installed sliding sleeves are a consumable product, sold to our customers and cemented in place in a well’s casing. Over 148,000 of our casing-installed sliding sleeves have been installed, including over 55,000 of our MultiCycle sliding sleeves. We produce two primary models of sliding sleeves: our GripShift sliding sleeves, which can be opened only once, and our MultiCycle sliding sleeves, introduced in late 2013, which can be opened and closed multiple times throughout the life of a well. Our casing-installed sliding sleeves can be utilized in both cemented and open-hole wellbores, with no practical limitation on the number of stages that can be installed in a well, and feature an inner-diameter which is the same as the casing in the wellbore. During completion operations, the downhole frac isolation assembly is placed in the sleeve and the inner barrel of the sleeve is shifted down, exposing the frac ports to the formation, allowing the completion of that stage to begin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Downhole frac isolation assembly. Our proprietary downhole frac isolation assembly is comprised of several subcomponents. The assembly, which is attached to a third-party’s coiled tubing reel, is primarily used to locate our sliding sleeves, to establish wellbore isolation and to shift our sliding sleeves open or closed. In addition, gauges within the downhole frac isolation assembly record downhole pressure and temperature data, which can be utilized to optimize the design of future completions. We typically own the assemblies and utilize them in our service to our customers. Our personnel operate the assemblies during completion operations in coordination with other on-site service providers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sand jet perforating. Our sand jet perforating technology uses a variation of the downhole frac isolation assembly utilized for shifting sleeves. Sand jet perforating is typically used with cemented wellbores. To cut access points into the formation, sand-laden fluid is pumped down the coiled tubing and through tungsten-carbide nozzles. The high-velocity slurry cuts through the casing and cement and into the formation. The tunnels created through this process serve as initiation points for stimulation. Stimulation treatments are pumped down the annulus between the coiled tubing and the casing. Although the sand jet perforating process requires more time per stage than using Multistage Unlimited sliding sleeves, it provides a practical option for pinpoint stimulation in wells that are already cased, as in the case of drilled, but uncompleted wells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SpotFrac system. Our SpotFrac system provides a means to straddle and mechanically isolate producing zones for targeted refracturing applications. The system includes a sand jet perforating assembly, enabling additional stages to be added if desired, and can perforate, isolate and stimulate multiple stages in a single trip.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | BallShift sleeves. Our BallShift sliding sleeves can be cemented in place and are activated by pumping a ball from surface that lands on seats in the sleeves, providing pinpoint stimulation. In some instances the BallShift sleeves will be utilized together with our coiled-tubing deployed technology in a hybrid application to increase the amount of stages that can be run in extended reach applications, with the BallShift sleeves installed at the toe of such wells.

· | Spectrum Tracer Services. We provide chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostics technologies used by oil and gas operators to assess completion performance, evaluate well production, and optimize field development strategies. Our fracture fluid identifier tracers, oil-soluble tracers and natural gas tracers enable efficient, cost-effective downhole diagnostics, providing oil and gas operators with critical data to efficiently optimize reservoir development and production.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Anderson Thompson Reservoir Strategies. Our specialized team of engineering consultants advises customers on optimized completion designs and field development strategies and evaluates well performance. ATRS engineers help us strengthen our relationships with our customers and have been effective at demonstrating the benefits of our Multistage Unlimited products and services as compared to traditional completion techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AirLock casing buoyancy system. Our AirLock casing buoyancy system facilitates landing casing strings in horizontal wells without altering a customer’s preferred casing and cementing operations. The AirLock system, which is installed with a well’s casing, allows the vertical casing section to be filled with fluid, while the lateral section remains air-filled and buoyant. The enhanced buoyancy significantly reduces sliding friction, while the enhanced weight of the vertical section provides the force needed to push the casing to the toe of the well, ensuring the casing reaches the desired depth and reducing casing running time and cost. Our AirLock system consists of two components that are made up in the casing string during run-in: a debris-trap and a seal collar. The debris-trap is installed in a casing connection just above the float shoe and the seal collar is installed at the bottom-most point of the vertical portion of the wellbore. The seal collar contains a breakable seal that locks air in the lower section of casing while the upper section is run and filled with fluid. After the casing is landed, surface pressure is increased to fragment the seal at a predetermined pressure, leaving an unrestricted casing bore, while seal fragments are collected by the debris trap, facilitating cementing operations.

· | Liner hanger systems. Introduced in late 2014, our proprietary liner hanger systems are specifically designed to perform in complex horizontal wells and are fully compatible with our Multistage Unlimited products. The liner hanger is used to distribute the loads and weight of the liner to the supporting casing.

 Business History
 ﻿
 We were incorporated in Delaware on November 28, 2012, under the name “Pioneer Super Holdings, Inc.” On December 13, 2016, we changed our name to “NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc.” On May 3, 2017, we completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock.
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property and Patent Protection
 ﻿
 We have dedicated resources toward the development of new technology and products designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of well completions processes. Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully introduce new or improved products to the market. Our MultiCycle sliding sleeves, downhole frac isolation assembly and other equipment involve a high degree of proprietary technology developed over several years, some of which is protected by patents.
 ﻿

We hold 11 U.S. patents and 17 related international patents that relate to our Airlock casing buoyancy system, OST tracers, casing installed sliding sleeves, frac isolation assemblies, and the methods utilized in the provision of our services. Our U.S. patents expire between 2030 and 2035. Our international patents expire between 2025 and 2032.
 ﻿
 We also have a number of U.S. and international patent applications pending. Some of these patent applications cover equipment and methods which are currently in development. The applications are in various stages of the patent prosecution process and patents may not issue on such applications in any jurisdiction for some time, if they issue at all.
 ﻿
 We believe that our patents have historically been important in enabling us to compete in the market to supply our customers with our products and services. We intend to enforce, and have in the past vigorously enforced, our patents. We may from time to time in the future be involved in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our patent rights. In addition to patent rights, we use a significant amount of trade secrets, or “know-how,” and other proprietary information and technology.
 ﻿

Research and Development
 ﻿
 We are engaged in research and development activities focused on the design, development, trialing and commercialization of innovative completions technologies and the improvement of existing products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred approximately $3.0 million, $3.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of research and development expense. In 2017, research and development expense was 1.5% of consolidated revenue and 4.6% of our total selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense. We expect that our research and development expense will increase in anticipation of the growth of our business.

     Customers 
 ﻿
 Our customer base primarily consists of oil and natural gas producers in North America and in certain international markets as well as oilfield service companies. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had over 240, 140 and 150 customers, respectively. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 30%, 49% and 44% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Crescent Point Energy (“Crescent Point”) accounted for 14%, 26% and 31% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during those years. Although we believe we have a broad customer base and wide geographic coverage of operations, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 ﻿
 Sales and Marketing
 ﻿
 Our sales and marketing activities are performed through a technically-trained direct sales force. We recognize the importance of a technical marketing program in demonstrating the advantages of new technologies that offer benefits relative to established industry methodologies. Our technical sales force advises customers on the benefits of pinpoint stimulation, MultiCycle sliding sleeves, tracer diagnostics services and our technical engineering resources.
 ﻿
 In the U.S. and Canada, sales of our Multistage Unlimited products and services, tracer diagnostics services and ATRS services are made directly to E&P companies. Our customers also hire the coiled tubing companies and pressure pumping services companies that work alongside us during the completion of a well. We provide our AirLock casing buoyancy system and liner hanger products directly to E&P companies as well as to oilfield services companies that act as distributors for those product lines. Although we do not typically maintain supply or service contracts with our customers, a significant portion of our sales represent repeat business.
 ﻿
 International sales are typically made to our local operating partners on a free on board basis with a point of sale in the United States. Some of the locations in which we have operating partners or sales representatives include Argentina, China, Russia and the Middle East. Our operating partners and representatives do not have authority to contractually bind our company, but market our products in their respective territories as part of their product or service offering.
 ﻿
 We provide extensive support services and have developed proprietary methodologies for assessing and reporting the information that is collected on our downhole gauges and through tracer diagnostics evaluations. In addition, ATRS engineers work with customers to evaluate post-completion well performance and on a pre-job basis to simulate the production and economic outcomes from pinpoint stimulation strategies relative to traditional completion techniques. We also provide technical education to the coiled tubing services companies and pressure pumping services companies, explaining the benefits of utilizing our technology for their operations and our customers.
 ﻿
 In addition to the technical marketing effort, we occasionally engage in field trials to demonstrate the economic benefits of our products and services. Periodically, we will provide ATRS services to E&P companies on a discounted basis, in exchange for their agreement to provide production data for direct comparison of the results of pinpoint stimulation to traditional completion techniques.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 A substantial portion of our business is subject to quarterly variability. In Canada, we typically experience higher activity levels in the first quarter of each year, as our customers take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, our revenue in Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that result in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtail drilling and completion activity. Access to well sites typically improves throughout the third and fourth quarters in Canada, leading to activity levels that are higher than in the second quarter, but lower than activity in the first quarter. Our business can also be impacted by a reduction in customer activity during the winter holidays in late December and early January.
 ﻿
 Suppliers and Raw Materials
 ﻿
 We acquire component parts and raw materials from suppliers, including machine shops. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Most of the raw materials we use in our operations, such as steel in various forms, electronic components, chemicals and elastomers are available from many sources.
 ﻿
 We generally try to purchase our raw materials from multiple suppliers, so we are not dependent on any one supplier. We will generally utilize multiple machine shops for the manufacturing of our component parts so that we are not dependent on any one machine shop. Our suppliers are also active in multiple regions which allows us to react to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2017, we added suppliers to increase third-party component part supply capacity. In addition, our joint venture, Repeat Precision, LLC (“Repeat Precision”), allows us to reduce our costs for certain product categories.

 Operating Risks and Insurance
 ﻿
 We currently carry a variety of insurance for our operations. Although we believe we currently maintain insurance coverage adequate for the risks involved, there is a risk our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that our insurance may not cover all losses.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, we must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of E&P companies at competitive prices. We compete in all areas of our operations with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than or comparable to ours.
 ﻿
 We believe that we compete not only against other providers of pinpoint stimulation equipment and services, but also with companies that support the other primary means of hydraulically fracturing a horizontal well, including plug and perf and ball drop completions.
 ﻿
 Our major competitors for our completion products and services include Schlumberger Limited, Halliburton Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company (“Baker Hughes”), Weatherford International Ltd, Packers Plus Energy Services, Nine Energy Service Inc., Superior Energy Services Inc. and Core Laboratories N.V. as well as a number of smaller or regional competitors.
 ﻿
 We believe that the most significant factors influencing our customer’s decision to utilize our equipment and services are technology, service quality, safety track record and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our products and services based on the technical attributes of our products and equipment, the level of technical and operational service we provide before, during and after the job, and the know-how derived from our extensive operational track record.
 ﻿
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
 ﻿
 We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of worker health, safety and the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, capital expenditures to prevent, limit or address emissions and discharges, and stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes and materials. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, and the issuance of injunctive relief.
 ﻿
 We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Further, we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, laws and regulations protecting the environment generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so. It is possible, that substantial costs for compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.
 ﻿
 While we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations will have a direct adverse effect on our operations, our customers are subject to a wide range of such laws and regulations, which could materially and adversely affect their businesses and indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including with respect to the following:

· | Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other emission control requirements. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting non-compliant operations.

· | Water Discharges. The Federal Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.

· | Climate Change. Our customers are or may become subject to statutes or regulations aiming to reduce emissions of GHGs. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published final rules under the CAA that establish new and more stringent emission control standards for methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) released from new and modified oil and natural gas development and production operations. These rules could have an adverse effect on our customers and result in an indirect material adverse effect on our business. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposal to stay the implementation of certain requirements while it reconsiders the rules. These rules have also been the subject of litigation. As a result, the future implementation of these rules remains uncertain. In addition, the United States and Canada are among almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. The agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. On June 1, 2017, the Trump Administration announced that the United States would be pulling out of the Paris Agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how any legal requirements imposed following the implementation of the Paris Agreement that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business or that of our customers, any such future laws, regulations or legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, oil and natural gas exploration activities could require our customers to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with their operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce.

· | Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that our customers generate. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible, however, that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in May 2016, several non-governmental environmental groups filed suit against the EPA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for failing to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, asserting that the agency is required to review its Subtitle D regulations every three years but has not conducted an assessment on those oil and natural gas waste regulations since July 1988. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.

  ﻿
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and comparable state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 ﻿
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, at the federal, state and local level, are authorized to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.
 ﻿
 Our customers’ operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The effect of these regulations may be to limit or increase the cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and indirectly materially and adversely affect our business.
 ﻿
 We supply equipment and services to customers in the oil and natural gas industry conducting hydraulic fracturing operations. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our products and services for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Aside from state laws, local

     land use restrictions may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Municipalities may adopt local ordinances attempting to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether or, at a minimum, allow such fracturing processes within their jurisdictions to proceed but regulating the time, place and manner of those processes. In addition, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over the process and various studies have also been conducted or are currently underway by the EPA, and other federal agencies concerning the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. State and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and natural gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. At the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly limit or otherwise regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed by some members of Congress to provide for such regulation.
 ﻿
 The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels prohibiting, limiting or otherwise regulating the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult, or even impossible, to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers’ costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our products and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 ﻿
 We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
 ﻿
 Part of our business involves the use of radioactive tracers, typically consisting of three standard isotopes (Iridium 192, Scandium 46 and Antimony 124), to help determine the existence of fractures within a well formation. The use of these materials requires us to obtain and comply with radioactive materials licenses issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) or its counterparts in the states where we perform these services if they are among the states to which the NRC has delegated its regulatory authority pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act (so-called “Agreement States”). Under the terms of these licenses, we are required to train designated personnel, maintain records, submit periodic reports, ensure the safety and reliability of related equipment and storage facilities, conduct radiation safety monitoring, and ensure the proper disposal of materials and equipment at the end of their useful lives. In the event we fail to adequately comply with these requirements, we could be subject to enforcement action, which could include fines, injunctive relief, or the revocation of our licenses.
