ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Amesite’s smart, intuitive learning environments help organizations thrive. Amesite is a high tech artificial intelligence software company offering a cloud-based platform and content creation services for business and university-delivered education and upskilling. Amesite-offered courses and programs are branded to our part. Amesite uses artificial intelligence technologies to provide customized environments for learners, easy-to-manage interfaces for instructors, and greater accessibility for learners in the US education market and beyond. The Company leverages existing institutional infrastructures, adding mass customization and cutting-edge technology to provide cost-effective, scalable and engaging experiences for learners anywhere.



We are passionate about improving the learner experience and learner outcomes in online learning products, and improving our Customers’ ability to create and deliver both. We are focused on creating the best possible technology solutions and have been awarded an innovation award for our product. We are committed to our team, and have been recognized with 10 workplace excellence awards, 4 of them national.



Amesite offers our white label platform to our Customers: universities, museums, businesses and government agencies. Amesite’s Customers offer learning to their users, who are students, professional learners and / or their own employees. Amesite derives revenue from the licensing of our platform, and user fees associated with its use by our Customers for their users. Some of our Customers generate revenue using our systems, including Universities and Museums.



Our Strategy



We deliver Learning Community Environment®s (LCESMs) to businesses and educational institutions (EIs) that enable them to offer branded learning products to their students, professional learners or employees with ease. Our business model offers flexibility for our Customers. Our Customers license our platform and can also contract with to us to create and maintain customized learning products, or easily launch their own learning products on the platform. We have entered into master service agreements with our Customers, including, but not limited to, universities such as Wayne State University and enterprises such as The Henry Ford Museum. These agreements include statements of work detailing the services to be rendered and programs or products to be delivered on the platform. We use the proprietary data we collect on learner behavior and responses with their consent, to deliver to learners engaging, effective courses and programs. Our Customers gain efficiency, flexibility and can generate high return on investment and revenue through partnership with us, because of the speed, flexibility, effectiveness and scalability of the LCESMs we build for them.



Universities need to be able to launch programs that upskill their alumni and other professionals, accessibly and at scale. Museums need to engage their patrons and visitors with high quality digital learning opportunities. Businesses need learning systems that enable them to upskill people quickly and efficiently. Retention and execution of strategic plans require that employees stay engaged, and learn effectively. Government needs to be able to offer learning programs that allow job seekers to advance skills. Amesite’s cloud-based platform addresses all of these key needs.



We target Customers who already have large cohorts of users who can consume their delivered learning programs. Our revenues are derived from license fees, but more importantly, by user fees, that we believe will enable us to scale revenue. Importantly, we aim to serve our Customers by delivering learning programs at price points that are accessible and are highly targeted to their needs.

Our Proprietary Technology



We believe that online learning products are essential for accessibility, engagement and scalability for businesses and EIs alike. We utilize artificial intelligence to achieve improved engagement, and continuous integration of current, qualified information into our learning products.



Our technology utilizes a flexible and scalable full stack solution, with robust tools powering front-end technology. Our code architecture offers outstanding accessibility and agility for engineers, using best-in-class languages for both client and server-side functions. We also use tools employed by many high-end platforms. Our architecture enables us to achieve full integration of best-in-class third party tools, and custom-built features, delivering on-demand and as-needed, such as leading calendar platform integrations, and high quality, encrypted video calling.



Our architecture enables us to utilize artificial intelligence algorithms to ultimately improve learning outcomes. Much as artificial intelligence algorithms presently recognize and respond to natural language on commercial platforms, predict behaviors and deliver suggestions, our algorithms have been developed to assist learners in accessing, utilizing and remaining engaged with platform content, their instructors and their peers.



We generate content for our Customers using the highest standards in business and higher education, and our business model enables us to deliver content for our Customers efficiently and rapidly. Rapidly evolving technology has driven the need to continuously upskill students and workforces, and we use the highest possible standards to deliver this content according to Customer needs. This substantially reduces the time it takes for traditional program creation by businesses or EIs.



We market to our Customers, and enable them to offer and monetize learning products, or to deliver learning products to their own employees efficiently and cost effectively. Our Customers want the capability of delivery to their own Customers, and are best able to market to them. We deliver the content and technology to enable this.



We protect and utilize learner data solely to improve learning outcomes. Learner data is collected with learner permission, and information about learner behavior, study preferences and preference for types of material delivered as part of learning products, will be used to improve learning outcomes and learner experiences. We will validate algorithms using both offline and online testing. By correlating learner behaviors with specific outcomes as identified by qualified instructors, we will train our algorithms specifically for important learning outcomes, enabling it to be a useful tool for instructors. We believe that the combinations of information that will be collected through our educational products, and outcomes measured using our online learning products will be unique, and constantly improving. We will never sell or distribute our learner data to third parties without the explicit permission of learners. We will not deliver unwanted content or advertising to learners or to Customer personnel. Our proprietary technology is developed solely for purposes of improving learner experiences and outcomes, and improving the ability of our Customers to deliver outstanding educational products.

Our Research and Development Programs



We use advanced technologies to create effective and accessible learning environments. We seek to improve learning at many levels, including college and professional. Our research and development programs will expand continuously based on learner preferences, outcomes and the desires of our Customers. Some of these will include:

● | Improvements in learner engagement with cloud-based platforms. We will continuously gather data on how learners engage with us and other online platforms, and conduct research and development to create and incorporate useful tools for learning on our platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvements in instructor experience using our platform. We will continuously develop tools designed to improve the ability of our Customers to deliver timely and relevant content, deliver assessments which are fair, correctly represent educational objectives and give repeatable outcomes when employed on our platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integration of new technology in the delivery of learning products. A “technology stack” is a combination of software products and programming languages used to create our platform. We will continuously develop improvements to our technology stack, inventing and integrating best-in-class online engagement features. These will range from invention of novel user experience features, to integration of capabilities offered by other vendors and developers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Qualification of information for use by learners in all sectors. We plan to provide both our Customers and our learners with the constantly improving ability to find and integrate qualified information into products on our platform, and maximize learner ability to utilize qualified information, designed to offer learners the most carefully curated, most relevant, timely and engaging materials in every discipline in which we offer products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



The online and software industries for higher education are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, government regulation, and strong defense of intellectual property. The overall market for technology solutions that enable providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of learners and educators and frequent introductions of new methods of delivering education online. While we believe that our platform, programs, technology, knowledge, experience, and resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major online companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, among others.



Any learning product that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current learning products. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other course offerings include efficiency, security and convenience, and availability. Our competitors fall primarily into the following groups:




● | Online Program Management (OPM) firms, who create and launch educational products for EIs and businesses, using either their own or others’ Learning Management Systems (LMSs).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Learning Management System (LMS) technology firms, who offer technology platforms suitable for offering online educational or training products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Learning product aggregators, who offer multiple ‘institutions or businesses’ learning products on online platforms for direct purchase by learners, or through licenses by institutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Many of the companies, colleges, or universities against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in education, software design and development, and have already obtained approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified engineers, scientists, and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.



We expect that the competitive landscape will continue to expand as the market for online programs at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:




● | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


● | ability of online programs to deliver desired learner outcomes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | robustness and evolution of technology offering; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | breadth and depth of service offering.
--+---------------------------------------




We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, on our ability to consistently deliver high-quality offerings; meet client needs for content development; attract, support and retain learners; and deliver desired outcomes for our Customers and their learners.



Government Regulation and Product Approval



The education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities, namely, the U.S. Department of Education (the “DOE”), accrediting agencies, and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws.



We contract with higher education institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with Customers. Our failure, or that of our Customers, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our Customers to maintain compliance with education laws.

We will abide by education laws, including incentive compensation rules, misrepresentation rules, accreditation rules and standards, among state and federal regulations. We also closely monitor state law developments and we will work closely with our Customers to assist them with obtaining any required approvals.



Our activities on behalf of our Customers are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as federal and state data protection and privacy requirements.



Sales and Marketing



We plan to grow our sales and marketing program as we build our Customer base, advancing from our small, direct sales force to a distribution network that has existing relationships with colleges, universities, non-profit organizations and businesses.



We also intend to develop a branding strategy to introduce and support our platform. The strategy may include our presence at colleges, universities, and other commercial institutions on a national, state, and regional basis to engage and educate users of our products, as well as engaging in a variety of other direct marketing methods to educational institutions and businesses. We plan to pursue selected business opportunities, including joint developments, collaborations and acquisitions that have the potential to build sales more rapidly. We aim to develop and pursue such opportunities on a consistent basis to grow the Company.
