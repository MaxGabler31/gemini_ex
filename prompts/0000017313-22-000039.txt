Item 1.     Business
ORGANIZATION

Capital Southwest Corporation, which we refer to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “CSWC,” or the “Company,” is an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company, or BDC, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized financing to middle market companies in a broad range of industry segments located primarily in the United States. Our common stock currently trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CSWC.”

We were organized as a Texas corporation on April 19, 1961.  Until September 1969, we operated as a small business investment company, or SBIC, licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended.  At that time, we transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest Venture Corporation, or CSVC, certain assets including our SBIC license.  CSVC was a closed-end, non-diversified investment company registered under the 1940 Act.  Effective June 14, 2016, CSVC was dissolved and its SBIC license was surrendered. All assets held in CSVC were transferred to us upon dissolution. Prior to March 30, 1988, we were registered as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company under the 1940 Act.  On that date, we elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. On September 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off, which we refer to as the Share Distribution, of CSW Industrials, Inc., or CSWI. CSWI is now an independent publicly traded company. The Share Distribution was effected through a tax-free, pro-rata distribution of 100% of CSWI’s common stock to our shareholders. Each of our shareholders received one share of CSWI common stock for every one share of our common stock on the record date, September 18, 2015. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares of CSWI common stock. Following the Share Distribution, we have maintained operations as an internally managed BDC and pursued a credit-focused investing strategy akin to similarly structured organizations. We intend to continue to provide capital to middle-market companies. We invest primarily in debt securities, including senior debt and second lien, and also invest in preferred stock and common stock alongside our debt investments or through warrants.
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, effective April 25, 2019, we are allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a resolution that limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date.

We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As such, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To continue to maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such income. Any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year that generated such taxable income.
CSWC has a direct wholly owned subsidiary that has elected to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the “Taxable Subsidiary”). The primary purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still allow us to satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. The Taxable Subsidiary is subject to U.S. federal income tax at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income.

Capital Southwest Management Corporation (“CSMC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CSWC, was the management company for CSWC. Effective December 31, 2020, CSMC merged with and into CSWC, with CSWC continuing as the surviving entity in the merger. Prior to December 31, 2020, CSMC generally incurred all normal operating and administrative expenses, including, but not limited to, salaries and related benefits, rent, equipment and other administrative costs required for its day-to-day operations (the “Administrative Expenses”). After December 31, 2020, the Administrative Expenses will be directly incurred by CSWC. The Company continues to be internally managed and the merger has no impact on the day-to-day operations of the business.

SBIC License
On April 20, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP (“SBIC I”) received a license from the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) to operate as an SBIC under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. SBIC I has an investment strategy substantially similar to ours and makes similar types of investments in accordance with SBA regulations. SBIC I and its general partner are consolidated for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, and the portfolio investments held by it are included in the consolidated financial statements. See “Regulation as a Small Business Investment Company” below for more information about the regulations applicable to SBIC I.

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS

We are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market, or LMM, companies and debt capital to upper middle market, or UMM, companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States. Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments.  Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.
We focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. Our core business is to target senior debt investments and equity investments in LMM companies. We also opportunistically target first and second lien loans in UMM companies. Our target LMM companies generally have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, between $3.0 million and $20.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $35.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $20.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $20.0 million.

We seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which historically have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participation. Our ability to invest across a LMM company’s capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies.

Our investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration between three and seven years from the original investment date.

We offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts. Our obligation to offer to make available significant managerial assistance to our 
3


portfolio companies is consistent with our belief that providing managerial assistance to a portfolio company is important to its business development activities.

Because we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms that are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio.

Recent Developments

On April 27, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share and a special dividend of $0.15 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The record date for the dividend is June 15, 2022. The payment date for the dividend is June 30, 2022.
On May 11, 2022, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The Amendment changed the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to Term SOFR. In addition, on May 11, 2022, CSWC entered into an Incremental Commitment Agreement, pursuant to which the total commitments under the Credit Agreement increased from $335 million to $380 million.
Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to achieve our investment objective of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and realizing capital appreciation from our equity and equity-related investments. We have adopted the following business strategies to achieve our investment objective:

•Leveraging the Experience of Our Management Team.  Our senior management team has extensive experience investing in and lending to middle market companies across changing market cycles. The members of our management team have diverse investment backgrounds, with prior experience at BDCs in the capacity of senior officers. We believe this extensive experience provides us with an in-depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of the middle market companies in which we invest. We believe this understanding allows us to select and structure better investments and to efficiently monitor and provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
•Applying Rigorous Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management. Our senior management team has implemented rigorous underwriting policies that are followed in each transaction. These policies include a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company’s competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness, which we believe allows us to better assess the company’s prospects. After investing in a company, we monitor the investment closely, typically receiving monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements. Senior management, together with the deal team and accounting and finance departments, generally meets at least quarterly to analyze and discuss in detail the company’s financial performance and industry trends. We believe that our initial and ongoing portfolio review process allows us to effectively monitor the performance and prospects of our portfolio companies.
•Investing Across Multiple Companies, Industries, Regions and End Markets. We seek to maintain a portfolio of investments that is appropriately diverse among various companies, industries, geographic regions and end markets. This portfolio balance is intended to mitigate the potential effects of negative economic events for particular companies, regions, industries and end markets. However, we may from time to time hold securities of an individual portfolio company that comprise more than 5% of our total assets and/or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. For that reason, we are classified as a non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.
•Utilizing Long-Standing Relationships to Source Deals. Our senior management team and investment professionals maintain extensive relationships with entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital who refer prospective portfolio companies to us. These relationships historically have generated significant investment opportunities. We believe that our network of relationships will continue to produce attractive investment opportunities.

•Focusing on Underserved Markets. The middle market has traditionally been underserved. We believe that operating margin and growth pressures, as well as regulatory concerns, have caused many financial institutions to de-emphasize services to middle market companies in favor of larger corporate clients and more liquid capital market transactions. We also invest in securities that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. We believe these dynamics have resulted in the financing market for middle market companies being underserved, providing us with greater investment opportunities.
•Focus on Established Companies. We generally invest in companies with established market positions, proven management teams with strong operating discipline, histories of generating revenues, and recurring cash flow streams. We believe that those companies generally possess better risk adjusted return profiles than earlier stage companies that are building their management teams and establishing their revenue base. We also believe that established companies in our target size range generally provide opportunities for capital appreciation.
•Capital Structures Appropriate for Potential Industry and Business Volatility. Our investment team spends significant time understanding the performance of both the target portfolio company and its specific industry throughout a full economic cycle. The history of each specific industry and target portfolio company will demonstrate a different level of potential volatility in financial performance. We seek to understand this dynamic thoroughly and invest our capital at leverage levels in the capital structure that will remain within enterprise value and in securities that will receive interest payments if such downside volatility were to occur.

•Providing Customized Financing Solutions. We offer a variety of financing structures and have the flexibility to structure our investments to meet the needs of our portfolio companies. We primarily invest in senior debt securities coupled with equity interests. We believe our ability to customize financing structures makes us an attractive partner to middle market companies.
INVESTMENT CRITERIA AND OBJECTIVES

Our investment team has identified the following investment criteria that we believe are important in evaluating prospective investment opportunities. However, not all of these criteria have been or will be met in connection with each of our investments: 

•Positive and Sustainable Cash Flow: We generally seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance.
•Excellent Management: Management teams with a proven record of achievement, exceptional ability, unyielding determination and integrity.  We believe management teams with these attributes are more likely to manage the companies in a manner that protects and enhances value.
•Competitive Advantages in Markets: We primarily focus on companies having competitive advantages in their respective markets and/or operating in industries with barriers to entry, which may help protect their market position.
•Strong Private Equity Sponsors: We focus on developing relationships with leading private equity firms in order to partner with these firms and provide them capital to support the acquisition and growth of their portfolio companies.
•Appropriate Risk-Adjusted Returns:  We focus on and price opportunities to generate returns that are attractive on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into consideration factors in addition to the ones depicted above, including credit structure, leverage levels and the general volatility and potential volatility of cash flows.
We have an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of our investment process relating to investments made by us. The current members of the investment committee are Bowen Diehl, Chief Executive Officer; Michael Sarner, Chief Financial Officer; Josh Weinstein, Senior Managing Director; and Ramona Rogers-Windsor, a member of the Board of Directors and a non-voting, observer of the investment committee. 
Investment Process

Our investment strategy involves a team approach, whereby our investment team screens potential transactions before they are presented to the investment committee for approval. Transactions that are either above a certain hold size or outside our general investment policy will also be reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. Our investment team generally categorizes the investment process into six distinctive stages: 

•Deal Generation/Origination:  Deal generation and origination is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with private equity firms, leveraged loan syndication desks, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, 
5


entrepreneurs, service providers such as lawyers and accountants, and current and former portfolio companies and investors.
•Screening:  Once it is determined that a potential investment has met our investment criteria, we will screen the investment by performing preliminary due diligence, which could include discussions with the private equity firm, management team, loan syndication desk, etc.  Upon successful screening of the proposed investment, the investment team makes a recommendation to move forward and prepares an initial screening memo for our investment committee.  We then issue either a non-binding term sheet (in the case of a directly originated transaction), or submit an order to the loan syndication desk (in the case of a large-market syndicated loan transaction).
•Term Sheet:  In a directly originated transaction, the non-binding term sheet will typically include the key economic terms of our investment proposal, along with exclusivity, confidentiality, and expense reimbursement provisions, as well as other terms relevant to the particular investment. Upon acceptance of the term sheet, we will begin our formal due diligence process. In a syndicated loan transaction, rather than a formal term sheet, we will submit an order for an allocation to the syndicated loan desk.
•Due Diligence:  Due diligence is performed under the direction of our senior investment professionals, and involves our entire investment team as well as certain external resources who together perform due diligence to understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company’s business plan, operations, financial performance, and legal risks.  On our directly originated transactions, our due diligence will often include (1) conducting site visits with management and key personnel; (2) performing a detailed review of historical and projected financial statements, often with a third-party accounting firm, to evaluate the target company’s normalized cash flow; (3) creating our own detailed modeling projections, including a downside case which attempts to project how the business would perform in a recession based on past operating history of either the company or the industry; (4) interviewing key customers and suppliers; (5) evaluating company management, including a formal background check; (6) reviewing material contracts; (7) conducting an industry, market and strategy analysis; and (8) obtaining a review by legal, environmental or other consultants.  In instances where a financial sponsor is investing in the equity in a transaction, we will leverage work done by the financial sponsor for purposes of our due diligence.  In syndicated loan transactions, our due diligence may exclude direct customer and supplier interviews, and will consist of a detailed review of reports from the financial sponsor or syndication agent for industry and market analysis and legal and environmental diligence. 
•Document and Close:  Upon completion of a satisfactory due diligence review, our investment team presents its written findings to the investment committee.  For transactions that are either over a certain hold size or outside our general investment policy, the investment team will present the transaction to our Board of Directors for approval.  Upon approval of the investment, we re-confirm our regulatory company compliance, process and finalize all required legal documents and fund the investment.
•Post-Investment:  We continuously monitor the status and progress of our portfolio companies, as well as our investment thesis developed at the time of investment.   We offer managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and provide them access to our investment experience, direct industry expertise and contacts.  The same investment team leader that was involved in the investment process will continue to be involved in the portfolio company post-investment.  This approach provides continuity of knowledge and allows the investment team to maintain a strong business relationship with the financial sponsor, business owner and key management of our portfolio companies.  As part of the monitoring process, members of our investment team will analyze monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements against previous periods, review financial projections, meet with the financial sponsor and management (when necessary), attend board meetings (when appropriate) and review all compliance certificates and covenants. Our investment team generally meets once each quarter with senior management to review the performance of our portfolio companies.
We utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio.  The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment’s expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company’s future outlook.  The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments.

•Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. The investment generally has a higher probability of being prepaid in part or in full.
6


•Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral. All new loans are initially rated 2.
•Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The investment may be out of compliance with financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due. 
•Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially.  Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired. 
Determination of Net Asset Value 

Quarterly Determinations
We determine our net asset value, or NAV, per share on a quarterly basis.  The NAV per share is equal to our total assets minus liabilities divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.

We determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) and a valuation process approved by our Board of Directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act. Our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio.

We undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments. The valuation process is led by the finance department in conjunction with the investment teams and senior management. Valuations of each portfolio security are prepared quarterly by the finance department using updated portfolio company financial and operational information.  Each investment valuation is also subject to review by the executive officers and investment teams. 

In conjunction with the internal valuation process, we have engaged multiple independent consulting firms that specialize in financial due diligence, valuation and business advisory services to provide third-party valuation reviews of the majority of our investments on a quarterly basis.  Our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our determination of the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. 
Determinations in Connection with our Offerings
The 1940 Act prohibits us from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current NAV per share of such stock, with certain exceptions. One such exception is prior shareholder approval of issuances below current NAV per share, provided that our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. We do not intend to seek shareholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock at our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. However, in the event we change our position, we will seek requisite approval of our shareholders.
In connection with each offering of shares of our common stock, our Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof is required by the 1940 Act to make the determination of whether we are selling shares of our common stock at a price below our then current NAV at the time at which the sale is made. Our Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof considers the following factors, among others, in making such determination:
•the NAV of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC;
•our management’s assessment of whether any material change in the NAV has occurred (including through the realization of net gains on the sale of our investments) from the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed NAV per share of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of our common stock; and
•the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) NAV of our common stock, which is based upon the NAV disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management’s assessment of any material change in the NAV since the date of the most recently disclosed NAV, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering.
7



Moreover, to the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we would provide to the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the NAV fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances, our Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine NAV within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current NAV, and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine NAV to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered.
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records are made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records are maintained with other records we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act.

COMPETITION

We compete for attractive investment opportunities with other financial institutions, including BDCs, junior capital lenders, and banks. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team and our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes. However, many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  Furthermore, our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and many have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, certain of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships, and build their market shares. Likewise, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions and valuation requirements that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.”

We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, because of this competition, we may be unable to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be unable to identify and make investments that satisfy our investment objectives or meet our investment goals.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our employees are vital to our success as an internally managed BDC. The long-term success of our business and the success of our investment strategy depends on our people. We strive to attract, develop and retain our employees by offering advancement and promotion opportunities, attractive compensation and benefit packages and a close-knit culture. The departure of our key investment and operations personnel could cause our operating results to suffer.
Our investment strategy depends heavily on the business owners, management teams, and financial sponsors of our portfolio companies and their respective employees, contractors and service providers. In our investment process, the analysis of these individuals is a critical part of our overall investment underwriting process and as a result we carefully review the qualifications and experience of the portfolio company’s business owners and management team and their employment practices. We strive to partner with business owners, management teams, and financial sponsors whose business practices reflect our core values.
We also strive to recruit talented and driven individuals who share our values. Our recruiting efforts utilize strong relationships with a variety of sources from which we recruit. We offer selected students investment analyst internships, which are expected to lead to permanent roles for high performing and high potential interns. Through our internship program, interns who want to become investment analysts have the opportunity to see the full investment process from origination to closing, as well as post-closing portfolio management activities. We routinely promote from within, promoting current employees who have shown the technical ability, attitude, interest and the initiative to take on greater responsibility.
We have designed a compensation structure, including an array of benefit plans and programs, that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective employees. For certain employees, our compensation strategy also includes an equity incentive plan, which we have structured to further align the interests of our employees with our shareholders, and to cultivate a strong sense of ownership and commitment to our Company. Through our performance review processes, our employees are annually evaluated by supervisors and our senior management team to ensure employees continue to develop and advance as 
8


expected. We provide a workplace designed to enable our employees to balance work, family and family-related situations including flexible working arrangements. Our employees have access to a parental leave program for birth, adoption placement or foster child placement. We are committed to creating and maintaining an atmosphere where all employees feel welcomed, valued, respected and heard so that they feel motivated and encouraged to contribute fully to their careers, our Company and our communities.
We are committed to fostering a workplace conducive to the open communication of any concerns regarding unethical, fraudulent or illegal activities. We seek to promote a safe environment that is free of harassment or bullying. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind, including, but not limited to, sexual, gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others. We seek feedback from employees on matters related to their employment or our operations including its financial statement disclosures, accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. Under our Whistleblower Policy, each employee of the Company has the ability to confidentially report via a dedicated, confidential reporting hotline questionable or improper accounting, internal controls, auditing matters, disclosure, or fraudulent business practices or other illegal or unethical behavior. We seek to protect the confidentiality of those making reports of possible misconduct and our Whistleblower Policy prohibits retaliation against those who report activities believed in good faith to be a violation of any law, rule, regulation or internal policy. Our Code of Business Conduct establishes applicable policies, guidelines, and procedures that promote ethical practices and conduct by the Company and all its employees, officers, and directors. Our Whistleblower Policy and Code of Business Conduct can be found on our website at www.capitalsouthwest.com/governance. 
As of March 31, 2022, we had twenty-three employees. These employees include our corporate officers, investment and portfolio management professionals and administrative staff. All of our employees are located in our principal executive offices in Dallas, Texas.
LEVERAGE

We borrow funds to make investments, a practice known as “leverage,” in an attempt to increase returns to our shareholders. Effective April 25, 2019, we are allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as calculated in accordance with the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowing. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a resolution that limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date. The amount of leverage that we employ at any particular time will depend on management’s and our Board of Directors’ assessments of portfolio mix, prevailing market advance rates, and other market factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Structure – Because we borrow money to make investments, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.” On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of "senior securities" in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act.

We intend to continue borrowing under our senior secured credit facility with ING Capital LLC (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Facility") in the future, and we may increase the size of the Credit Facility, add additional credit facilities, or otherwise issue additional debt securities or other evidences of indebtedness in the future, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.

See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources" as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 for information regarding the Credit Facility and the issuance of the 4.50% Notes due 2026 (the "January 2026 Notes") and the 3.375% Notes due 2026 (the "October 2026 Notes").
BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES

Because we generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. Our investment team is primarily responsible for the execution of the publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. We do not expect to execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for us, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While we will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, we may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to us. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we determine in good faith that such 
commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided. We did not pay any brokerage commissions during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of our shareholders. Under the DRIP, if we declare a dividend, registered shareholders who have opted into the DRIP as of the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. The share requirements of the DRIP are satisfied through open market purchases of common stock by the DRIP plan administrator. Shares purchased in the open market to satisfy the DRIP requirements will be valued based upon the average price of the applicable shares purchased by the DRIP plan administrator, before any associated brokerage or other costs.
ELECTION TO BE REGULATED AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

We are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC. Our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes have a significant impact on our operations. Some of the most important effects on our operations of our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC are outlined below.

•We report our investments at market value or fair value with changes in value reported through our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we report all of our investments, including debt investments, at market value or, for investments that do not have a readily available market value, at their “fair value” as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Changes in these values are reported through our Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption of “net change in unrealized appreciation on investments.” See “Determination of Net Asset Value” above.

•We intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our shareholders. We generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax only on the portion of our taxable income we do not timely distribute to shareholders (actually or constructively).
As a RIC, so long as we meet certain minimum distribution, source of income, and asset diversification requirements, we generally are subject to U.S. federal income tax only on the portion of our taxable income and gains that we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year and pay a 4% U.S. federal excise tax on such income. We intend to distribute to our shareholders substantially all of our income. We may, however, make deemed distributions to our shareholders of any retained net long-term capital gains. If this happens, our shareholders will be treated as if they received an actual distribution of the net capital gains and reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in us. Our shareholders also may be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to their allocable share of the U.S. federal income tax we pay on the deemed distribution. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.” We met the minimum distribution requirements for tax years 2020 and 2019 and intend to meet the minimum distribution requirements for tax year 2021. We continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code.   

In addition, we have a Taxable Subsidiary that holds a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiary is consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiary. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiary is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of our gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiary, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment generally would flow through directly to us. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of U.S. federal income taxes. Where interests in LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiary, the income from those interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiary and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate U.S. federal income tax expense as a result of its ownership of the portfolio companies. This U.S. federal income tax expense, if any, is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

•Our ability to use leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments is limited.
As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities of at least 150%, which became effective April 25, 2019. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a resolution that limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that that asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166% at any time after the effective date. For this purpose, senior securities include all borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. Additionally, our ability to utilize leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments may be limited by this asset coverage requirement. While the use of leverage may enhance returns if we meet our investment objective, our returns may be reduced or eliminated if our returns on investments are less than the costs of borrowing. On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act.

•We are required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies.
As a BDC, we are required to have a majority of directors who are not “interested persons” as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we are required to comply with other applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, including those requiring the adoption of a code of ethics, maintaining a fidelity bond and placing and maintaining our securities and similar investments in custody. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company” below.
Regulation as a Business Development Company

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act.  The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates and principal underwriters as well as their respective affiliates.  The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the members of the board of directors of a BDC be persons other than “interested persons,” as defined in the 1940 Act.  In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.

The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of holders present or represented by proxy at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (2) more than 50% of our voting securities.

The following is a brief description of the 1940 Act provisions applicable to BDCs, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 1940 Act and rules issued thereunder by the SEC:

•Generally, BDCs must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance available to certain portfolio companies.  In general, as a BDC, a company must, among other things: (1) be a domestic company; (2) have registered a class of its securities pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act; (3) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of eligible portfolio companies, including early stage or emerging companies and businesses suffering or just recovering from financial distress (see following paragraph); (4) offer to make available significant managerial assistance to such portfolio companies; and (5) file a proper notice of election with the SEC.
•An eligible portfolio company generally is a domestic company that is not a regulated or private investment company or a financial company (such as brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and investment banking firms) and that: (1) does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; (2) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange with an equity market capitalization of less than $250 million; or (3) is controlled by the BDC itself or together with others and, as a result of such control, the BDC has an affiliated person on the board of directors of the company.  The 1940 Act presumes that a person has “control” of a portfolio company if that person owns at least 25% of its outstanding voting securities.
•As a BDC, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement.  Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our shareholders arising from any act or omission constituting willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of that person’s office.
•We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCAA”) was signed into law and, among other things, instructs the SEC to issue rules or amendments to rules allowing BDCs to use the same registration, offering, and 
12


communication processes that are available to operating companies. The rules and amendments specified by the SBCAA became self-implementing on March 24, 2019. On April 8, 2020, the SEC adopted rules and amendments to implement certain provisions of the SBCAA (the “Final Rules”) that, among other things, modify the registration, offering, and communication processes available to BDCs relating to: (i) the shelf offering process to permit the use of short-form registration statements on Form N-2 and incorporation by reference; (ii) the ability to qualify for well-known seasoned issuer status; (iii) the immediate or automatic effectiveness of certain filings made in connection with continuous public offerings; and (iv) communication processes and prospectus delivery. In addition, the SEC adopted rules that will require BDCs to comply with certain structured data and inline XBRL requirements. The Final Rules will generally become effective on August 1, 2020, except that a BDC eligible to file short-form registration statements on Form N-2, like the Company, must comply with the Inline XBRL structure data requirements for its financial statements, registration statement cover page, and certain prospectus information by August 1, 2022. 
Qualifying Assets

The 1940 Act provides that we may not make an investment in non-qualifying assets unless at the time of the investment at least 70% of the value of our total assets (measured as of the date of our most recently filed financial statements) consists of qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include: (1) securities of eligible portfolio companies; (2) securities of certain companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time we initially acquired their securities and in which we retain a substantial interest; (3) securities of certain controlled companies; (4) securities of certain bankrupt, insolvent or distressed companies; (5) securities received in exchange for or distributed in or with respect to any of the foregoing; and (6) cash items, U.S. government securities and high-quality short-term debt. 
Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the qualifying assets requirement, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, where we purchase securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, provides, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments

Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, short-term investments in secured debt investments, independently rated debt investments, and diversified bond funds, which we refer to as temporary investments.
Senior Securities

BDCs generally have been permitted by the 1940 Act, under specific conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to its common stock if its asset coverage, as defined by the 1940 Act, is at least 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, the 1940 Act allows a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur by reducing the minimum asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150%, if certain requirements under the 1940 Act are met. On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was decreased from 200% to 150%, which became effective April 25, 2019. Additionally, the Board of Directors also approved a resolution that limits the Company’s issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date. We are required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150%, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.
As of March 31, 2022, we had $205.0 million, $140.0 million and $150.0 million in total aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, the January 2026 Notes and the October 2026 Notes, respectively. As of March 31, 2022, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 193%.

In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our shareholders or repurchasing such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for 
13


temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.  Under specific conditions, we are also permitted by the 1940 Act to issue warrants.

Common Stock

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock at a price below the then current NAV of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We do not intend to seek shareholder authorization to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock at our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. See "Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital."

Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct

We adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions.  Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as those investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. We have also adopted a code of conduct that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer (or persons performing similar functions), our Board, and all other employees. This code sets forth policies that these executives and employees must follow when performing their duties. The code of ethics and code of conduct are available on the Company website at www.capitalsouthwest.com/governance.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner in which we believe is consistent with the best interest of our shareholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that we expect would have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. Our proxy voting decisions are made by the investment team that is responsible for monitoring the investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that anyone involved in the decision-making process discloses to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict of which he or she is aware. Shareholders may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer c/o Capital Southwest Corporation, 8333 Douglas Avenue, Suite 1100, Dallas, Texas 75225.
Compliance Policies and Procedures

We have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We are further required to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures. Michael S. Sarner serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
Exemptive Relief

The right to grant restricted stock awards under the 2010 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "2010 Plan") terminated on July 18, 2021, ten years after the date that the 2010 Plan was approved by the Company's shareholders pursuant to its terms. 
In connection with the termination of the 2010 Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders approved the Capital Southwest Corporation 2021 Employee Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "2021 Employee Plan") as part of the compensation package for its employees, the terms of which are, in all material respects, identical to the 2010 Plan. On July 19, 2021, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the prior exemptive order relating to the 2010 Plan (the “Order”) to permit the Company to (i) issue restricted stock as part of the compensation package for its employees in the 2021 Employee Plan, and (ii) withhold shares of the Company’s common stock or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock from the participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of restricted stock pursuant to the 2021 Employee Plan. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Capital Southwest Corporation 2021 Non-Employee Director Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "Non-Employee Director Plan") as part of the compensation package for non-employee 
14


directors of the Board of Directors. In connection therewith, on May 16, 2022, we received an exemptive order that supersedes the Order (the "Superseding Order") and will cover both the employees and non-employee directors of the Board of Directors. The Non-Employee Director Plan will become effective upon shareholder approval at our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. 

Other

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The prior approval of the SEC is not required, however, where a transaction involves no negotiation of terms other than price.

We expect to periodically be examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or to investors in such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. shareholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge” or “conversion” transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold shares of our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
For purposes of our discussion, a “U.S. shareholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

•A citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•A corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•A trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
For purposes of our discussion, a “non-U.S. shareholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. shareholder nor a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “partnership”) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member of the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership. A prospective shareholder that is a partner or member in a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock.

Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her, or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company

Election to be Taxed as a RIC

We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we timely distribute to our shareholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we generally must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next year. In such case, we generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.

Taxation as a RIC

Provided that we qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which we define as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year ended December 31 and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

•Meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;
•Qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code), or the 90% Income Test; and
•Diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities, if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and
◦no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) the securities, other than the securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.

To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests.

In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we have established the Taxable Subsidiary to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividends, interest or other income under the 90% Income Test. We may establish additional subsidiaries 
16


for the same purpose in the future. Any investments held through the Taxable Subsidiary generally are subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments.

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (including debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount or payment-in-kind interest that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement necessary to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to U.S. federal income tax.

Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, such as cancellation of indebtedness income in connection with the work-out of a leveraged investment (which, while not free from doubt, may be treated as non-qualifying income) or the receipt of other non-qualifying income.

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us, as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants, generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.

Investments by us in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes, and therefore, our yield on any such securities may be reduced by such non-U.S. taxes. Shareholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us.

We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company” above. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that are not advantageous from an investment standpoint.

If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our shareholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our shareholders. See “Failure To Obtain RIC Tax Treatment” below.

As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. U.S. federal income tax law generally permits a RIC to carry forward (1) the excess of its net short-term capital loss over its net long-term capital gain for a given year as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year and (2) the excess of its net long-term capital loss over its net short-term capital gain for a given year as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year. Future transactions we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (1) disallow, suspend, or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (2) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (3) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (4) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (5) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (6) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial

transactions and (7) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions.

As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code). If the entity is a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be “securities” for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the entity is not treated as a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” however, the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income and assets of the partnership allocable to us. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and therefore could adversely affect our qualification as a RIC. We intend to monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC.

We may invest in preferred securities or other securities for which the U.S. federal income tax treatment may not be clear or may be subject to re-characterization by the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the expected tax treatment, such tax treatment could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities or otherwise change our portfolio in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code.

We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each shareholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of shareholders are treated as taxable dividends. The IRS has issued a revenue procedure indicating that this rule will apply where the total amount of cash to be distributed is not less than 20% of the total distribution. This 20% limitation has been temporarily reduced to 10% for distributions declared on or after November 1, 2021, and on or before June 30, 2022. Under this revenue procedure, if too many shareholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each such shareholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of stock. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with this revenue procedure that are payable in part in our stock, taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain, to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. If a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock.

Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment

If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for that year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain U.S. federal tax at corporate rates or to dispose of certain assets).

If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to shareholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our shareholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (in the case of non-corporate U.S. shareholders, generally at a maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income of 20%). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.

If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then seek to re-qualify as a RIC, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any built-in gain recognized during the succeeding five-year period, unless we made a special election to recognize all built-in gain upon our re-qualification as a RIC and pay the U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain.

Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in March 2020. The CARES Act lifts certain deduction limitations originally imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act). The enactment of the CARES Act did not result in any material adjustments to our income tax provision for the years ended March 31, 2022 or 2021, or to our net deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2022 or 2021.
Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations

Prospective investors should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock. See "Risk Factors – Legislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us."
REGULATION AS A SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY
SBIC I’s SBIC license allows it to incur leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA regulations currently permit SBIC I to borrow up to $175 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures with at least $87.5 million in regulatory capital (as defined in the SBA regulations), subject to SBA approval. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest only debentures, with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten-year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. Receipt of an SBIC license does not assure that SBIC I will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding; rather, such funding is dependent upon SBIC I continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to SBIC I’s assets over our shareholders in the event we liquidate SBIC I or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by SBIC I upon an event of default.
On August 11, 2021, we received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit us to exclude the senior securities issued by SBIC I or any future SBIC subsidiary of the Company from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage requirement applicable to the Company under the 1940 Act. 
SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private investor capital to eligible “small businesses” as defined by the SBA. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses, and provide them with consulting and advisory services. Under current SBA regulations, eligible small businesses generally include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and has average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $6.5 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must invest 25.0% of its investment capital to “smaller enterprises” as defined by the SBA. The definition of a smaller enterprise generally includes a business that (together with its affiliates) has a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million for the most recent fiscal year and has average net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $2.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative industry size standard criteria to determine eligibility for designation as an eligible small business or a smaller enterprise, which criteria depends on the primary industry in which the business is engaged and is based on the number of employees or gross revenue of the business and its affiliates. However, once an SBIC has invested in an eligible small business, it may continue to make follow-on investments in the company, regardless of the size of the company at the time of the follow-on investment, up to the time of the company's initial public offering, if any.
The SBA generally prohibits an SBIC from providing financing to small businesses with certain characteristics, such as relending or businesses with the majority of their employees located outside the United States, and business engaged in certain prohibited industries, such as project finance, real estate, farmland, financial intermediaries or “passive” (i.e. non-operating) businesses. Without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not provide financing or a commitment to a small business in an amount equal to more than approximately 30.0% of the SBIC’s regulatory capital in any one company and its affiliates.
The SBA places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies (such as limiting the permissible interest rate on debt securities held by an SBIC in a portfolio company). An SBIC may exercise control 
19


over a small business for a period of up to seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA's prior written approval.
The SBA restricts the ability of an SBIC to provide financing to an “associate,” as defined in the SBA regulations, without prior written approval from the SBA. SBA regulations also prohibit, without prior SBA approval, a “change of control” or “change in ownership” of transfer of an SBIC (as such terms are defined in the SBA regulations) and require that SBICs invest idle funds in accordance with SBA regulations. In addition, SBIC I may also be limited in its ability to make distributions to us if it does not have sufficient capital, in accordance with SBA regulations.
SBIC I is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including, among other things, requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants, a periodic examination by an SBA examiner, and the performance of a financial audit by an independent auditor.
THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REGULATIONS

The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, has adopted corporate governance listing standards with which listed companies must comply in order to remain listed.  We believe that we are in compliance with these corporate governance listing standards.  We intend to monitor our compliance with future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we remain in compliance.
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND SARBANES-OXLEY ACT COMPLIANCE

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items.  In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and regulations promulgated thereunder, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders.  For example:

•Pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•Pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•Pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
•Pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
