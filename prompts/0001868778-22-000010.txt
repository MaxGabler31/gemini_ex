ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Data is foundational to how digital enterprises run their businesses and make strategic decisions, including creating new offerings, serving their customers and driving operational efficiency. We have pioneered a new category of software, the Intelligent Data Management Cloud, or IDMC. Our AI-powered IDMC platform delivers best-of-breed solutions that enables enterprises to create a single source of truth for their data, allowing them to create compelling 360-degree customer experiences, automate data operations across enterprise-wide business processes like supply chain management, financial planning and operations, and provide governed and secure data access to their employees. It also enables our customers to pursue holistic data-driven digital strategies by accelerating workload migrations to the cloud, thus, enabling all the advantages of cloud analytics.
As enterprises embrace data to modernize their business, data fragmentation has proliferated across a myriad of systems, including cloud and on-premises data warehouses, data lakes, databases and applications. This fragmentation is compounded by the increasing number of data consumers who require access to data from these heterogeneous data systems to perform their jobs. Legacy approaches to data management were simply not built to address the growing complexity and scale of the digital enterprise.
To address these challenges, we have pioneered a new way for businesses to accurately track where their data resides, understand what relationships exist across their different data repositories, and understand who is accessing the data and how it is being used—all at enterprise scale. Our cloud-native platform leverages over 50,000 metadata-aware connections that continuously scan our customers’ data to create rich and highly contextualized metadata to create and manage a metadata system of record that acts as a single source of truth about their data. This allows our AI engine, CLAIRE, to help customers access better data faster, make contextual recommendations about data relationships, uncover novel insights about their business and automate previously manual tasks. As more customers adopt our platform, CLAIRE continuously analyzes new transactions, configurations, rules, and decisions and uses this increased intelligence to drive further automation and deliver better insights to our customers, which in turn we believe will continue to accelerate the adoption of our platform.
Our platform also consists of a wide range of interoperable data management products, including data integration, API and application integration, data quality, master data management, customer and business 360 applications, data catalog, data marketplace, and governance and privacy. These products leverage our platform’s shared services and can be consumed from our SaaS-based cloud offering, which is run on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, and can also be deployed as a self-managed service in our customers’ cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments. The growth and adoption of our cloud platform has led to the number of cloud transactions on our platform, which is a measure of data processed, increasing from 0.2 trillion per month in 2015, to 16.9 trillion per month in 2020 and to 27.8 trillion per month as of December 31, 2021. Our cloud ARR as of December 31, 2021 was $317.0 million, compared to $226.6 million as of December 31, 2020, representing year-over-year growth of 40%.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 5,700 active customers in over 100 countries and territories worldwide, including 9 of the Fortune 10, 84 of the Fortune 100 and 923 of the Global 2000. As our customers generate more data, they typically increase their usage of our platform by adding new use cases, adopting more products, or adding more users. Our ability to expand within our customer base has been demonstrated by our subscription net retention rate, which was 114% and 114% as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
We are a strategic partner to our customers in their modernization and digital transformation initiatives, which we believe is reflected by the number of customers that spend more than $1 million in subscription ARR with us, which were 153, 104, and 66 as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We believe this is a direct

Industry Overview: The Data-Driven Digital Enterprise
We believe data is the most valuable competitive asset today as companies increasingly pursue digital transformation initiatives to modernize their businesses. Enormous amounts of data are being generated by people, applications, and devices worldwide. Enterprises are seeking to connect data across their various applications, systems, and IT environments in order to become data-driven businesses. Understanding and connecting these data assets as well as migrating workloads to the cloud, enables superior insights across the business organization, better service of customers, automation of supply chains, and the democratization of secure, governed data access for all employees.
Challenges Facing Data-Driven Digital Enterprises
Businesses face a number of challenges in their drive to become data-driven digital enterprises. These include:
•Data volumes are exploding, which leads to massive complexity.    The rise of cloud computing, low cost data storage and the proliferation of applications that generate and access data, combined with the increasing volume of data from mobile, social and IoT, is resulting in an explosion of the volume, variety, and velocity of data. According to a March 2021 report from IDC, “The amount of digital data created over the next five years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage.” This new data creates opportunities to generate greater business insights and pursue new market opportunities, but is overwhelming for organizations to manage, aggregate, and normalize.
•Workloads are moving to the cloud, creating a multi-cloud, hybrid world.    As enterprises undertake the massive transition to cloud, we believe a majority of their workloads will remain on-premises for the foreseeable future due to the mission-critical processes they support. The complexity of this hybrid world will be further exacerbated as enterprises also employ multi-cloud strategies. According to IDC, "82% of organizations are currently using multiple clouds - or plan to within the next 12 months.” As a result, we expect enterprises will require new technologies purpose-built to connect, analyze, manage, and normalize

data anywhere it resides using modern, cloud-native architectures that can seamlessly be deployed in any IT environment.
•Data fragmentation is making data management more complex.    As businesses leverage more cloud-based services, data is being generated and stored across a fragmented landscape of SaaS applications, cloud storage repositories, cloud databases and cloud data lakes. Each of these data repositories stores data in a unique format, making it increasingly challenging to aggregate data in a normalized, consistent, and high-quality format. This continued fragmentation magnifies the challenge of bringing together data from across the enterprise to derive new insights and inform critical business decision making.
•The need to democratize data access creates a greater need for data governance and privacy support.    As more employees use data to perform their jobs, enterprises are struggling to provision user access to data, track and monitor who is accessing data, and protect sensitive data. Additionally, the increased regulatory focus on data privacy is further driving the importance of policy, governance, reporting and monitoring. According to Gartner®, “By 2025, 60% of large organizations will use one or more privacy-enhancing computation techniques in analytics, business intelligence or cloud computing.”
•Mainstream adoption of AI and machine learning requires reliable and accurate data.    AI and ML technologies promise to influence nearly every facet of business operations, driving process efficiencies, augmenting human capabilities, and discovering new insights that were not previously available. Automated data management technologies are critical to allow enterprises to reliably and accurately train data science models, enabling them to pursue AI-driven business strategies. 
Limitations of Existing Approaches to Data Management
Data management tools are intended to provide organizations the ability to manage the entire lifecycle of their data. This includes accessing data from various disparate sources, normalizing data across formats, cleansing data for quality, connecting data to destinations, governing data access, protecting data from breaches, and creating a single source of truth for data.
Historically, companies have utilized existing approaches to data management for tactical and discrete use cases, such as transferring data from one core application into a data warehouse and aggregating data from multiple repositories to conduct basic reporting and analytics, which only addressed a limited part of the data management lifecycle. As companies become truly data-driven, they are recognizing that these legacy approaches may hinder their data strategies that underpin their digital transformation initiatives.
Existing approaches to data management include the following:
•Manual and custom hand coding by in-house or outsourced engineering resources to integrate data and applications for narrowly defined use cases;

•Legacy on-premises tools designed primarily for structured data types from internal on-premises business systems;
•Application-specific and platform-native data management tools designed only to work within their own native products and data formats; and
•Point solutions that only address discrete data management use cases, such as data and application integration, data catalog, data governance or master data management.
These existing approaches to data management suffer from some or all of the below limitations:
•Not natively built for the cloud.    Many legacy data management approaches have inherent flexibility, scalability, and capacity constraints as they were not originally designed for the adoption of cloud-based workloads. Often server-based, these products may only be able to manage a subset of the total volume of data and may require additional infrastructure and people to avoid user experience issues, such as latency and unpredictable spikes in pricing and costs. The inflexible and incompatible nature of non-native cloud approaches frequently results in knowledge loss, unwieldy and insecure data and slower innovation.

•Lack of AI-driven automation.    Legacy data management approaches lack the AI capabilities necessary to automate data management tasks, accurately identify and emulate human actions, and automatically classify data assets. Without these capabilities, data users are limited to pursuing automation only within the narrow pathways permitted by existing APIs, significantly limiting the applicability of AI technologies to basic data management processes.
•Inability to scale and support new data types and processing frameworks.    Legacy data management approaches were designed for a limited set of structured data types typically from internal business systems and can fail to capture, manage, organize, classify, and govern semi-structured and unstructured data increasingly generated from connected devices, applications, and social media. With enterprises generating and utilizing large volumes of disconnected, disorganized data, created by many users globally, enterprises struggle to scale and support their data management efforts. 
•Inability to support the end-to-end data management lifecycle.    Legacy data management approaches are generally point solutions designed to address narrow aspects of data management. These approaches are typically disconnected and not integrated with the enterprise’s holistic end-to-end data management strategy. For example, certain existing products can normalize diverse data types but may fail to deliver the governance and security necessary for organizations to manage the ongoing quality of their data.
•High cost of ownership.    Manual, custom hand coding, legacy on-premises tools, and point solutions are often time-consuming, costly to operate and require extensive manual data preparation prior to use. Their architectures frequently require maintenance of the underlying infrastructure, upgrades and patches, and system configuration. As a use case grows in scale, these offerings can require substantial overhead costs to manage and support a wide variety of data management requirements, forcing enterprises to make tradeoffs due to resource scarcity, which may result in overall compromised performance and brittle data pipelines.
•Inability to support hybrid multi-cloud environments.    Application-specific and platform-native data management approaches are generally only intended to run on specific environments and for a limited set of data types and use cases. As a result, they may only provide severely limited visibility of enterprise data within and outside the organization, and rarely across clouds and multiple applications. These approaches limit the organization’s flexibility to capture, maintain, distribute, and govern data across dynamic hybrid multi-cloud environments.

•Lack of extensibility to incorporate future technologies.    Data management is a highly dynamic industry characterized by constantly evolving technologies and architectures. Commonly, new innovations displace prior data management methods. Existing solutions often lack an open architecture and flexible design. As a result, organizations using proprietary or open source code can be forced to continually rework their data management architectures, leading to substantial costs, risks, and increased time to market.
•Inability to address the expanding breadth of data users.    Many existing solutions do not typically make their functionality accessible to all data management constituents within an organization. Certain products optimize for ease of use for business analysts and citizen integrators but lack the enterprise-grade functionality to address more complex data management use cases. Other existing products have been optimized for complexity, but at the sacrifice of usability. This trade-off often results in fragmented products and tools for an organization’s data management capabilities, which become a strong impediment to enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.
The Need for an Intelligent Data Management Cloud
Historically, enterprise data was generated and stored in highly structured, static and monolithic on-premises systems that were only accessed by a few, highly trained individuals and used primarily for analysis and reporting of historical enterprise metrics. Over the course of the last two decades, enterprises have expanded their IT strategies to embrace a wide range of SaaS applications, cloud infrastructure platforms, and more recently cloud data platforms to transform into data-driven digital enterprises.
As a result, data volumes have exploded and data is being generated and stored across a fragmented landscape of SaaS applications, cloud storage repositories, cloud databases and cloud data lakes. These different data repositories store data in unique formats, both structured and unstructured, with specific characteristics. This data is often consumed and ingested in real time, making it increasingly challenging to aggregate data in a

normalized, consistent, and high-quality format. Despite these challenges, as data has become one of the most valuable assets for enterprises and the vast majority of employees are data consumers, it has become embedded in highly complex operational use cases and is at the heart of new data-driven digital strategies.


In order for organizations to successfully become data-driven digital enterprises, we believe they must manage this growing scale, complexity and proliferation of data from a single platform that serves as a central data management layer that leverages AI and machine learning to unify data management across their ever-expanding number of clouds and enterprise systems. To address these challenges, we have pioneered the industry’s first AI-powered Intelligent Data Management Cloud (IDMC).

The IDMC Network Effects
We benefit from powerful network effects. As more customers have adopted our platform, the metadata managed by our platform has increased rapidly. From January 2019 to December 31, 2021, the metadata on our platform grew at a CAGR of 245%.
This growth in metadata helps fuel advancements in CLAIRE’s understanding of advanced data management workloads and fuels further automation. For example, when bringing together multiple datasets about customers stored in different formats, CLAIRE can automatically identify data inconsistencies and errors, such as:
•whether a data point looks anomalously large or small compared to the rest of the dataset and should be flagged as potentially incorrect;
•whether a data point is in the correct format (e.g. inconsistent dates) and should be modified to match other data points;
•distinguishing between similarly named people automatically by comparing multiple attributes simultaneously to ensure that different customers can be uniquely identified; and
•identify personal or other sensitive data and ensure that it is protected and complies with regulations such as CCPA, GDPR and others.
As a result, CLAIRE’s insights and automation reduces the potential business impact from bad data and the need to manually review individual data points in massive data sets, saving significant amounts of time. As CLAIRE analyzes more data and business rules, its recommendation engine becomes more accurate and the sophistication of its automation increases. We believe these network effects will continue to drive greater adoption of our platform as our customers, both existing and prospective, will see a greater return on their data management investments with Informatica.

Our Opportunity
We have a history of expanding the addressable market of our platform through continuous innovation. Over the last five years, we have significantly expanded our addressable market by investing in our platform and launching several new products. Our products address the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms, which IDC estimates at a value of $31 billion by the end of 2021 and $56 billion by the end of 2025, which represents a CAGR of 16%.
We estimate that our current global market opportunity is approximately $44 billion. To estimate our addressable market opportunity, we identified the number of companies worldwide across all industries, based on independent industry data from Dun and Bradstreet. We segment these companies into different size categories based on their annual revenue. We estimate potential Informatica ARR per company based on a representative company who buys all of our products, including an assumed migration of their on-premises installed base to our cloud platform. We then multiply the number of companies in each size category by the 90th percentile of potential Informatica product ARR per company. The total addressable market is the potential ARR per company times the total number of companies that we could sell to globally. We believe this potential ARR is an accurate representation of our total addressable market opportunity today.
Our Growth Strategies
We are pursuing our large market opportunity with growth strategies that include:
•Continue to advance IDMC by building new cloud products.    We plan to make significant ongoing investments in research and development to release new cloud products that will further expand our addressable market. We will also continue to invest in our cloud go-to-market strategy with dedicated product management, pre-sales, customer success, consulting, and professional services to help drive greater usage of our portfolio of new and existing cloud products among all data users.
•Expand within existing customers.    We have a strong track-record of expanding within our existing customers. We believe there are significant cross-sell and upsell opportunities within our existing customer base by adding new products, addressing new workloads, and growing with our customers’ overall data footprint. In addition, we intend to assist our customers in migrating their traditional on-premises data management applications to our cloud solutions.
•Expand our total customer base.    Historically we have focused our direct sales efforts on IT leaders within large enterprises; however, as the universe of data practitioners expands, we have augmented our outreach with a high-velocity inside sales team that is focused on targeting the line of business persona with our easily accessible cloud solutions. We continue to make investments in sales and marketing to grow our overall customer base, with a focus on targeting IT leaders and end users of data-driven companies.
•Continue to grow and develop our partner ecosystem.    Our strategic partners—including cloud hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform; cloud data platforms like Snowflake and Databricks; global system integrators like Deloitte, Accenture and Cognizant; and our value-added resellers and distributors—help extend the reach of our go-to-market strategy and accelerate the adoption of our platform. We plan to continue investing in R&D to maintain product support and compatibility with our strategic partners, and we intend to further build out our partner program to broaden our distribution footprint globally and drive greater awareness and consumption of our products.
•Continue to expand our international business.    We believe that the addressable market for our platform in EMEA and Asia-Pacific is substantially larger than our current market penetration. As enterprises around the world increase their public cloud adoption, we see a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud products outside of North America.

IDMC Architecture
Our platform is based on a multi-tenant, multi-cloud, microservices-based architecture hosted on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. It leverages intelligence resource management, auto-scaling, and partitioning logic to manage our compute and storage footprint, thereby driving resiliency, performance and efficiency. Our cloud platform runs globally across multiple regions and within each region our microservices are distributed to avoid single points of failure in order to ensure fault tolerance even in the case of full physical data center outage. Our platform architecture consists of four critical components:
•High-performance connectors for cloud and on-premises;
•Optimized data processing engines;
•Metadata and data intelligence; and
•Distributed multi-cloud control plane

- 17 -



High performance connectors for cloud and on-premises:    Connecting and accessing data is an essential capability across all data management services. Our platform’s high-performance connectivity enables accessing data for multiple integration patterns including real-time, change data capture, batch, streaming or API. Our platform’s connectivity spans over 50,000 metadata-aware connections that can access applications, databases, business intelligence tools, data modeling tools, data lakes, data warehouses, mainframes, messaging systems, file systems, IoT devices and other critical enterprise data repositories.
Optimized data processing engines:    Our platform offers multiple data processing options optimized for data volumes, types, latency and data management operations. Our platform supports unstructured data, complex hierarchical data and relational data types, deployed within our elastic and serverless compute environment. Our platform also offers flexibility of deploying these data management operations on third party compute platforms leveraging advanced pushdown optimization to AWS Redshift, Microsoft Azure Synapse, Google Cloud Big Query, Snowflake and Databricks. Depending on the size of data, data locality, pattern of integration and ecosystem, our platform will select the best processing method.
•Elastic and serverless processing.    For large batch (petabyte scale) processing, our platform uses elastic and serverless Spark-based processing.
•Pushdown optimization.    For data to be transformed within a database or system, our platform uses advanced pushdown optimization (ELT) to enhance performance. For example, customers can use IDMC to push down data processing workloads natively to cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake.
•Secure hybrid architectures.    For hybrid workloads where data is located on-premises within the customer firewall, IDMC provides a secure agent to support hybrid deployment architectures.
•Integration and workflow orchestration engine.    For real-time and process integration across multiple applications supporting business processes, our platform provides a business process orchestration engine to manage the integrations and workflows.

Metadata and data intelligence:    Leveraging our portfolio of AI and machine learning algorithms applied to various metadata types (e.g., technical, business, operational, usage, social), our platform provides intelligence and automation across all data management services. By scanning and managing metadata from a wide variety of sources including databases, applications, files, cloud platforms, mainframes, big data stores, BI tools, ETL tools, modeling tools, hand code and scripts, context is captured through a metadata graph database to deliver a metadata system of record and automation recommendations for enterprise data management operations. Our platform manages a total of 11 petabytes of active metadata to automate tasks and processes, delivering thousands of hours of time and cost savings for our users.

In addition, Informatica is a top Databricks partner and was recognized for our early adoption of Delta Lake in 2019 with Databricks’ ISV Impact Partner of the Year award. In 2021, we launched cloud-native support for Databricks SQL. Our product integration and joint go-to-market with Databricks extends beyond data integration to data cataloging and end-to-end data governance.
•Global System Integrators. We have deep relationships with leading global system integrators, such as Deloitte, Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini, KPMG, Wipro, and TCS. We have over 15,000 certified Informatica professionals across these partners. We partner closely with them on the data management portion of their client engagements. We co-create and co-sell solutions to solve customer needs where we combine the power of our innovation and their services to deliver against the customer business objectives.
•Channel Partners. We have a scaled and well-defined alliances program where we partner with value-added resellers and distributors across the world to expand our reach in international markets. Our relationship with these channel partners ranges from fulfilment services to co-sell or independent resell in some markets.
Collectively, our robust partner ecosystem helps us source leads, drive awareness of our platform, build unique and tailored solutions for customers, and provide state-of-the-art training and implementation support to our customers. We continue to invest in formal alliances with leading consulting, data management, and implementation service providers to help our customers migrate their legacy data management solutions to the cloud.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions primarily through a global direct sales team, which consists of field sales, technical sales, inside sales and partner sales professionals segmented by customer size and region. Our direct sales team is focused both on new customer acquisition and driving expanded use of our products with existing customers, as well as fostering long-term collaborations to drive their multi-year journey to the cloud. The breadth of our platform offerings allows us to engage at many levels of an organization and across many key buying personas and functional centers—e.g., the chief data officer’s organization, the chief information officer’s organization, and line of business buyers like the chief marketing officer and chief financial officer. The substantial majority of our global sales and marketing efforts are carried out by teams located in North America, EMEA and Japan. In Asia-Pacific, we go to market with a combination of direct sales and channel alliances.
Our marketing strategy is global, data-driven and digital-first, designed to generate awareness of our products and a targeted pipeline of qualified opportunities. Our marketing team combines the creation of inbound demand, to drive traffic to our website and usage of our platform, with direct marketing, business development, and marketing efforts targeted at business and technology leaders. We believe in a data-driven targeting of all our user personas with personalized content, offers and messaging, including joint go-to-market initiatives with our strategic partners. 
Customer Support and Success
We support our customers through a global customer support and success team consisting of approximately 800 employees as of December 31, 2021, based out of 10 locations worldwide anchored around our major delivery hubs in Redwood City, London and Bangalore. The primary objective of this team is to support our customers, so they realize optimal business value from our products by providing the right subject matter expertise to accelerate 
- 20 -


value creation. Our delivery framework is the right blend of people and technology, powered by a technology platform to interact with our customers and offer digital knowledge assets tailored to the customer persona for in-depth guidance on how to drive business outcomes with Informatica solutions. This team also manages customer renewals. Our Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 4.6/5.0, with approximately 74% of our customers rating us 5/5, and our renewal rates for subscription and maintenance in 2021 were 92% and 95%, respectively. The CSAT score is determined based on an internal survey of customers following the close of any support case, whereby customers rate their experience between 1 and 5 (with 5 being the highest). We achieved a 14% response rate for this survey and therefore the results may not be reflective of our broader customer base.
Research and Development
Informatica is well positioned and effectively manages research and development costs with strategic development centers across the globe–Redwood City, California Toronto, Canada, Stuttgart, Germany, Dublin, Ireland and Bangalore, India. With over 2,000 full-time employees dedicated to research and development as of December 31, 2021, Informatica spends over $200 million annually in research, development and related activities to advance our platform roadmap. On the partnership front, Informatica is heavily invested in joint innovation and joint solutions with the major hyperscalers and cloud platforms (i.e., AWS, Microsoft, Google Cloud Platform, Snowflake, Databricks). For additional information on our technology collaborations, see the section titled “—Our Partners.”
Competition
The markets we serve are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. With the launch of Informatica IDMC, we believe we are the first data management vendor to offer enterprises a single cloud platform serving a comprehensive range of data management requirements. Our competition includes the following:
•Hand-coded custom-built solutions developed by internal IT teams;
•Point solution vendors that compete with one of our products such as Talend and Collibra;
•Cloud service providers (CSPs) with limited platform-specific capabilities in data management such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform; and
•Stack vendors that compete across in many of our markets with data management solutions such as IBM and Oracle.
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
•ability to offer a comprehensive platform with best of breed products;
•interoperability with multi-cloud, hybrid environments and applications;
•ability to embed advanced AI and machine learning in our platform;
•performance, reliability and security;
•ease of deployment and ease of use by the full breadth of data practitioners;
•elasticity and ability to quickly scale services;
•strength of cloud ecosystem partnerships;
•responsiveness to evolving customer needs and use cases;
•success of sales & marketing efforts;
•quality of customer support; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe, based on the factors listed above, that we are favorably positioned relative to our competitors. Nonetheless, some of our competitors have advantages over us, such as greater financial resources, larger sales forces, better brand recognition, longer operating histories, and more expansive geographical footprints. For additional information see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”

Regulatory Matters
We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending and storing of electronic messages, human resource services, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, intellectual property and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, export controls, international sanctions laws, federal securities laws and tax regulations, which are continuously evolving and developing. The manners in which existing laws and regulations are applied to SaaS businesses, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, often are unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as privacy, data protection and security, pricing, advertising, taxation, content regulation and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
In addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, data protection, spam, data storage, data protection, content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information and other matters that may be applicable to our business. More countries are enacting and enforcing laws related to the appropriateness of content and enforcing those and other laws by blocking access to services that are found to be out of compliance. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves, as an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and as our solutions are used in a greater number of countries and by additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation.”
Privacy, Data Protection and Security
We place a priority on privacy, data protection and data security. We post on our website our privacy policy, and we maintain certain other policies and practices relating to data security and concerning our processing, use and disclosure of personal information. We use standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission to conduct transfers of European personal data to jurisdictions not deemed adequate by the European Commission. We collect and use aggregated user information to develop, provide and improve our products. 
Our commitments under the Privacy Shield Principles are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In addition, our publication of our privacy policy and other statements regarding privacy and security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if they are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations, including the standard contractual clauses relating to any category of personal data and business associate agreements that impose certain obligations and restrictions upon us relating to our handling of protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we are subject, as well as their interpretation, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change over time. For example, in 2016 the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a broad regulation governing data privacy, which became effective in May 2018 and replaced the Data Protection Directive. The GDPR establishes requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue. In the United Kingdom (UK), although the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the UK in June 2021 that allows for the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, this decision may be revoked or modified and will need to be renewed after four years from the date of adoption. It remains to be seen how the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU will impact the manner in which United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated and enforced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, EU data protection authorities, or other regulatory bodies in the longer term.
Additionally, several states have begun enacting new laws relating to privacy and data security. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of personal information. Moreover, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020. The CPRA creates obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Other states have also enacted or proposed similar data privacy laws. For example, in 2021, Virginia passed its Consumer Data Protection Act, and 
- 22 -


Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. The effects of the CCPA, CPRA, and other evolving privacy laws in the United States are significant and have required, and may require, us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. More generally, the various privacy, data protection and data security legal obligations that apply to us, and their interpretation and enforcement, may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our applications or platform. We may need to take additional measures to comply with the changes in our legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to avoid information security incidents or breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data.
Our security policies, procedures, and controls are routinely audited and attested by third parties for compliance, certification, or adherence to industry security standards and regulations, such as SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, UK Cyber Essentials, ISM Protected, GxP/CGMP and FedRAMP. Our cloud products maintain the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts (AICPA) SOC 2®, and SOC 3® attestation reports based on the trust services criteria relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality (applicable trust services criteria) set forth in TSP section 100, 2017 Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy (AICPA, Trust Services Criteria), commonly known as the AICPA Systems and Organizational Control (SOC 2®, and SOC 3®). Informatica also maintains compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (HIPAA Security Rule), and the Notification in the Case of Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (HITECH Breach Notification Requirements), as described in Part 164 of CFR 45, commonly known as HIPAA/HITECH.Our on-premises MDM products and cloud-based Master Data Management (MDM) products earned Letters of Compliance for GxP, also known as cGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice), relevant to pharmaceutical industries. In November 2021, our MDM Cloud Edition product, operating in the Australia AWS region, earned an ISM Protected letter of compliance. In February 2022, our IICS cloud product - operating in AWS GovCloud, achieved its first FedRAMP Moderate Authorization To Operate (ATO) sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, and Texas-RAMP compliance.
Our information systems and technical infrastructure for cloud services are hosted within SOC 2® attested data centers and utilize a combination of clustering, multiple datacenters and data replication to maintain high availability and resiliency. Our cloud products utilize identity and access controls, multi-factor authentication, real-time security monitoring, and both encryption in transit and encryption at rest to protect customer data using keys unique to each tenant.
Informatica’s security teams focus on proactive application, network and system security, privacy and governance, internal and supply chain risk management, disaster recovery and business resiliency, security consultation, education and incident response. We maintain a documented vulnerability management program that includes periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on servers, workstations, network infrastructure and applications, and subsequent remediation of vulnerabilities. External security researchers are encouraged to discreetly send us potential security vulnerabilities through our Responsible Disclosure Program, where reporters of qualifying findings are posted to our Security Hall of Fame. In addition, our products and infrastructure are tested regularly through penetration tests using both internal expertise and third-party teams, and any vulnerabilities found are remediated based on risk.
Human Capital Management
Our Values: DATA (Do Good, Act as One Team, Think Customer-First and Aspire & Innovate) are our foundation and define the Informatica experience. With the mutual goals of “delighting our employees and our customers”, we invest with strong intent to the lifecycle journey beginning with recruiting and onboarding, fostering a culture of inclusiveness, diversity, equity and belonging with a focus on growing both the business and our employees. Our employees receive competitive compensation and benefit programs, and are recognized in a number of ways, including employee driven appreciation and recognition programs. We frequently survey our employees and work to continually strengthen our culture. Our commitment to our employees has been especially evident during the pandemic, and we have initiated extended work from home/staged opening protocols, with a multitude of programs designed to drive wellness and engagement as well as at home productivity. This commitment has been reflected in strong engagement scores. As of December 2021, our Glassdoor overall rating was 4.3 out of 5.0 with a CEO Approval Rating of 96% and a Recommend to a Friend Rating of 90%. Additionally, Informatica has won numerous Best Places to Work awards.
- 23 -


As of December 31, 2021, we had over 5,500 full-time employees, including approximately 2,000 in product development, 1,500 in sales and marketing, 1,400 in operations and customer support, and 600 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2021, over 3,600 of our employees were located outside the United States, with approximately 2,400 of our employees located in India. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, in certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements which may automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We may be required to comply with the terms of these collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are proud to be a global leader in the promotion and practice of diversity and inclusion. In addition to having offices and employees all over the world, we take pride in and celebrate our cultural diversity. Informatica searches the globe for top talent in an effort to recruit and hire diverse individuals with a variety of skills, experiences, and backgrounds. Our objective is to continue to improve our hiring, development, advancement, and retention of diverse talent and to foster an environment of inclusivity, diversity, equity and belonging (IDEB). Our employees are key contributors to supporting our IDEB vision with employee resource groups, postings and education on our IDEB site, organized wide celebrations, speakers, and community outreach.
We require our employees and managers to participate in training programs directed at maintaining a harassment-free, diverse, and secure workplace. With our diverse employee population, we uphold the rights to work in an environment that promotes equal opportunity and prohibits discriminatory practices against race, color, national origin, ancestry, medical condition, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), marital status, registered domestic partner status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic characteristics and information, age, veteran status, or any other protected characteristic. We are committed to cultivating a respectful workplace and preventing harassment in all its forms.
Health and Safety
We recognize that a healthy environment and safe workplaces are critical to our business, strategy, and communities. We address environmental issues in an integrated manner to encompass protection of the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce. For example, in response to COVID-19 and the significant increases in remote workforces in March 2020, we mandated a work-from-home policy to protect our employees, families, customers, and our communities.
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our workforce continues to operate remotely where necessary, and our top priority remains providing support for our employees, partners, and customers. We are fortunate that the nature of our business allowed us to successfully operate on a work-from-home basis and in this new dynamic hybrid environment. We have been able to successfully adapt to the current challenges and deliver results despite the pandemic while continuing to protect the health and safety of our workforce and customers.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide robust market-based compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, all qualified employees are eligible for variable pay and to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). 
To support the health and wellness of our workforce, we offer premium health coverage with minimal out-of-pocket contributions for our global employees as well as a number of other welfare programs for added security. Employees also are well supported in their time-off needs.
Training and Development
We believe every employee can make a difference and can shape their career at Informatica, so we empower them in their roles to explore various career paths. We assist employees as they grow in a role in general career advancement with access to both on-line and classroom (now virtual) training. Employees have access to both a rich array of technical and professional development opportunities.

Communication and Engagement
Frequent and transparent communications are paramount at Informatica to engage and inform our teams. We utilize multiple communication channels to ensure our employees and managers receive timely information regarding the business strategy, product and service releases, financial results and priorities; as well as how to stay connected.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had 33 patent applications filed and 111 patents issued in a variety of jurisdictions. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through February 2040. In addition, we have registered identifiers important to our business including “Informatica” and “CLAIRE” as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “Informatica” and similar variations. In addition to the protections provided by our intellectual property rights, as part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, distributors, and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Where appropriate, we have also entered into patent cross-license agreements with third parties, thereby acquiring additional intellectual property rights which preserve our ability to pursue normal business activity and minimize our risks in entering new and adjacent technology markets.
Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our platform infringes their intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or channel partners, whom our license or other agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain services or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected subscriptions or services, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, including as a result of becoming a public company, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. We are not aware of any current infringement of any third-party patents or other proprietary rights by us, although we cannot guarantee this is the case. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. For a further discussion of our intellectual property rights, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
