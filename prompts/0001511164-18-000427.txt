ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Summary

Biotricity Inc. (the Company, Biotricity, we, us, our) is a leading-edge medical technology company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical, healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established. We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue. In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance and reducing healthcare costs. We intend to first focus on a segment of the multi-billion-dollar diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known as MCT.

We have developed our Bioflux MCT technology, which is comprised of a monitoring device and software component, and are in the process of commercializing and earning revenues from the sale of this device and its services, and building new strategic relationships to accelerate our market strategy and growth. On April 6, 2018, our new Bioflux remote monitoring device was deployed with our first customer  a reputed medical practice specializing in diagnosing, treating, managing, and researching diseases and disorders of the heart and vascular system. This customer intends to leverage the real-time, high-precision mobile cardiac telemetry solution to assist in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, enhance patient outcomes, improve patient compliance, and curb healthcare costs.

History

Our company was incorporated on August 29, 2012 in the State of Nevada. At the time of our incorporation the name of our company was Metasolutions, Inc. On January 27, 2016, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment), effective as of February 1, 2016, whereby, among other things, we changed our name to Biotricity Inc.

iMedical was incorporated on July 3, 2014 under the Canada Business Corporations Act.

On February 2, 2016, we completed the acquisition of iMedical through our indirect subsidiary 1062024 B.C. LTD., a company existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia (Exchangeco), as described more fully below (collectively referred to as the Acquisition Transaction).
 
1

In connection with the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, we experienced a change of control, as:

·
 our sole director resigned and a new director, who was the sole director of iMedical, was appointed to fill the vacancy;

·
 our Chief Executive Officer and sole officer, who beneficially owned 6,500,000 shares of our common stock, resigned from all positions and transferred all of his shares back to us for cancellation;

·
 the former management of iMedical were appointed as our management; and

·
 the former shareholders of iMedical entered into a transaction whereby their existing common shares of iMedical were exchanged for either: (a) shares in the capital of Exchangeco that are exchangeable for shares of our common stock at the same ratio as if the shareholders exchanged their common shares in iMedical at the consummation of the Acquisition Transaction for our common stock (the Exchangeable Shares); or (b) shares of our common stock, which (assuming exchange of all such Exchangeable Shares) would equal in the aggregate a number of shares of our common stock that constitute 90% of our issued and outstanding shares as of the date of the closing date of the Acquisition Transaction.

Immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, we transferred all of the then-existing business, properties, assets, operations, liabilities and goodwill of the Company, to W270 SA, a Costa Rican corporation, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Assignment and Assumption Agreement). We did not receive any consideration for such transfer other than to permit the facilitation of the Acquisition Transaction. Accordingly, as of immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, we had no assets or liabilities.

On February 2, 2016, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with 1061806 BC LTD. (Callco), a British Columbia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, Exchangeco, iMedical and the former shareholders of iMedical (the Exchange Agreement), whereby Exchangeco acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of iMedical, taking into account the Exchangeable Share Transaction (as defined below). After giving effect to this transaction, we commenced operations through iMedical through our 100% ownership of Exchangeco (other than the Exchangeable Shares) and Callco.

Effective on the closing of the Acquisition Transaction:

(a)
 the Company issued approximately 1.197 shares of its common stock in exchange for each common share of iMedical held by iMedical shareholders who in general terms, are not residents of Canada (for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) (the Non-Eligible Holders);

(b)
 shareholders of iMedical who in general terms, are Canadian residents (for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) (the Eligible Holders) received approximately 1.197 Exchangeable Shares in the capital of Exchangeco in exchange for each common share of iMedical held (collectively, (a) and (b) being, the Exchangeable Share Transaction);

(c)
 each outstanding option (each an Option) to purchase common shares in iMedical (whether vested or unvested) was exchanged, without any further action or consideration on the part of the holder of such option, for approximately 1.197 economically equivalent replacement options (each a Replacement Option) with an inverse adjustment to the exercise price of the Replacement Option to reflect the exchange ratio of approximately 1.197:1;

(d)
 each outstanding warrant (each a Warrant) to purchase common shares in iMedical was adjusted, in accordance with the terms thereof, such that it entitles the holder to receive approximately 1.197 shares of the common stock of the Company for each Warrant, with an inverse adjustment to the exercise price of the Warrants to reflect the exchange ratio of approximately 1.197:1;
 
2

(e)
 each outstanding advisor warrant (each an Advisor Warrant) to purchase common shares in iMedical was adjusted, in accordance with the terms thereof, such that it entitles the holder to receive approximately 1.197 shares of the common stock of the Company for each Advisor Warrant, with an inverse adjustment to the exercise price of the Advisor Warrants to reflect the exchange ratio of approximately 1.197:1; and

(f)
 the outstanding 11% secured debentures of iMedical (each a Convertible Debenture) were adjusted, in accordance with the adjustment provisions thereof, as and from closing, so as to permit the holders to convert (and in some circumstances, permit the Company to force the conversion of) the Convertible Debentures into shares of the common stock of the Company at a 25% discount to the purchase price per share in our next offering.

Pursuant to the rights and privileges of the Exchangeable Shares, the holders of such Exchangeable Shares maintain the right to: (i) receive dividends equal to, and to be paid concurrently with, dividends paid by the Company to the holders of its common stock; (ii) vote, through the Trustees voting of the Special Voting Preferred Stock (as defined herein), on all matters that the holders of common stock of the Company are entitled to vote upon; and (iii) receive shares of common stock of the Company upon the liquidation or insolvency of the Company or upon the redemption of such Exchangeable Shares by Exchangeco. The Exchangeable Shares do not give the holders thereof any economic, voting, or other control rights over either Exchangeco or iMedical.

As part of the Exchangeable Share Transaction, we entered into the following agreements, each dated February 2, 2016:

·
 Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement) with Exchangeco, Callco and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the Trustee); and

·
 Support Agreement (the Support Agreement) with Exchangeco and Callco.

Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the parties created a trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries, which are the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, enabling the Trustee to exercise the voting rights of such holders until such time as they choose to redeem their Exchangeable Shares for shares of the common stock of the Company, and allowing the Trustee to hold certain exchange rights in respect of the Exchangeable Shares.

As a condition of the Trust Agreement and prior to the execution thereof, we filed a Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of State, effective February 2, 2016, designating a class of our preferred shares as the Special Voting Preferred Stock (the Special Voting Preferred Stock) and issued one share of the Special Voting Preferred Stock to the Trustee.

The Special Voting Preferred Stock entitles the Trustee to exercise the number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares outstanding on a one-for-one basis during the term of the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement further sets out the terms and conditions under which holders of the Exchangeable Shares are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote during any stockholder meetings of our company.

Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, we granted the Trustee the right to require the Company to purchase the Exchangeable Shares from any beneficiary upon the occurrence of certain events including in the event that we are bankrupt, insolvent or our business is wound up. The Trust Agreement continues to remain in force until the earliest of the following events: (i) no outstanding Exchangeable Shares are held by any beneficiary under the Trust Agreement; and (ii) each of iMedical and us elects to terminate the Trust Agreement in writing and the termination is approved by the beneficiaries.

Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement, we agreed to certain covenants while the Exchangeable Shares were outstanding, including: (i) not to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock unless Exchangeco simultaneously declares or pays an equivalent dividend for the holders of the Exchangeable Shares; (ii) advising Exchangeco in advance of any dividend declaration by the Company; (iii) ensure that the record date for any dividend or other distribution declared on the shares of the Company is not less than seven days after the declaration date of such dividend or other distribution; (iv) taking all actions reasonably necessary to enable Exchangeco to pay and otherwise perform its obligations with respect to the issued and outstanding Exchangeable Shares; (v) to ensure that shares of the Company or other property are delivered to holders of Exchangeable Shares upon the liquidation or insolvency of the Company, the holders' election to cause the Company to issue shares of its common stock in exchange for the Exchangeable Shares, or as otherwise set out in the agreement and in the rights and restrictions of the Exchangeable Shares; and (vi) reserving for issuance and keeping available from our authorized common stock such number of shares as may be equal to: (A) the number of Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding from time to time; and (B) the number of Exchangeable Shares issuable upon the exercise of all rights to acquire Exchangeable Shares from time to time.

The Support Agreement also outlines certain restrictions on our ability to issue any dividends, rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all of our stockholders during the term of the agreement unless the economic equivalent is provided to the holders of Exchangeable Shares. The Support Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario.

As of the closing of the Acquisition Transaction, there were an equivalent of approximately 25,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding of which pre-existing stockholders hold 2,500,000 and former iMedical shareholders held: (a) an equivalent of 9,123,031 shares of our common stock through their ownership of 100% of the Exchangeable Shares and (b) 13,376,947 shares of our common stock directly.

As a result, our pre-Acquisition Transaction stockholders held approximately 10% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and the former stockholders of iMedical held approximately 90% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, either directly or indirectly through their ownership of 100% of the Exchangeable Shares.

Furthermore, up to 458,750 shares of our common stock that were outstanding prior to the Acquisition Transaction were held in escrow (down from an original 750,000), subject to forfeiture in the event we were not able to raise $6 million by the forfeiture date, which was extended from the previous deadlines of November 2, 2016 and May 2, 2017 to July 31, 2017. As of July 31, 2017, based on successful capital raises completed and a pro rata calculation, there were no shares remaining in escrow subject to potential forfeiture.

Any shares of our common stock and any Exchangeable Shares, in either case that were issued in the Exchangeable Share Transaction, are subject to the following lock-up schedule (unless such schedule is accelerated at the discretion of our board of directors, with the written consent of HRA Capital, an adviser as further described below):

·
 10% were released upon effectiveness of the Companys registration statement in Form S-1 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing for the resale of such shares as provided therein (the S-1 Filing);

·
 25% were released on the 6 month anniversary of effectiveness of the S-1 Filing

·
 50% were released on the 9 month anniversary of effectiveness of the S-1 Filing; and

·
 the remaining 15% shall be released on the 12 month anniversary of effectiveness of the S-1 Filing.
 
4

iMedical entered into a placement agent agreement dated October 31, 2015 with Highline Research Advisors LLC, a former affiliate of Merriman Capital, Inc., pursuant to which, among other things, they agreed to assist iMedical with going public by merger with a public company. The above consent was required to prevent us from unilaterally waiving the lock-up requirements, which was a condition to the Acquisition Transaction in the event Highline was subsequently retained to raise funds on our behalf after the closing of the Acquisition Transaction.

Description of Business

Company Overview

We are a leading-edge medical technology company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical, healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established. We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue. In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance and reducing healthcare costs. We are first focusing on a segment of the multi-billion-dollar diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known as MCT.

To date, we have developed our Bioflux MCT technology which is comprised of a monitoring device and software component, verified our business model, and built strategic partnerships to accelerate our market strategy and growth. We started commercial sale of our technology to customers in April 2018. 

We have established a research partnership with the University of Calgary to determine the predictive value of electrocardiogram (ECG) readings in preventative healthcare applications. The study is designed to identify novel patterns in ECG readings that may be translated into probability models for use in the development of proprietary algorithms for diagnostic applications, and to determine if ECG readings have predictive value for use in preventative healthcare applications, such as self-managed care. The research is partly funded by the National Research Council of Canada. As part of the collaboration, we have the right to license any intellectual property discovered, created or reduced to practice in the performance of the collaboration that was created solely by the Universitys personnel. Otherwise, we own all intellectual property resulting from the collaboration. The term of the collaboration is until December 31, 2020.

Market Overview

Chronic diseases are the number one burden on the healthcare system, driving up costs year over year. Lifestyle related illnesses such as obesity and hypertension are the top contributing factors of chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. Government and healthcare organizations are focused on driving costs down by shifting to evidence-based healthcare where individuals, especially those suffering from chronic illnesses, engage in self-management. This has led to massive growth in the connected health market, which is projected to reach $59 billion by 2020 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.4%. Remote patient monitoring (RPM), one of the key areas of focus for self-management and evidence-based practice, is growing at a CAGR of 49%, with an estimated 36 million patients using such solutions by 2020. Currently, over 50% of hospitals are already using RPM solutions to improve risk management and care quality.

The number one cost to the healthcare system is cardiovascular disease (CVD), responsible for 1 in every 6 healthcare dollars spent in the US. By 2030, CVD is expected to have an impact of over $1 trillion in medical expenses and lost productivity. With CVD also being the number one cause of death worldwide, early detection, diagnosis, and management of chronic cardiac conditions are necessary to relieve the increasing burden on the healthcare infrastructure. Diagnostic tests such as ECGs are used to detect, diagnose and track certain types of cardiovascular conditions. We believe that the rise of lifestyle related illnesses associated with heart disease has created a need to develop cost-effective diagnostic mechanisms to fill a hole in the current ECG market.
 
5

The global ECG market is expected to be worth $28 billion in 2021 and is growing at a CAGR of 4.8%. The factors driving this market include an aging population, an increase in chronic diseases related to lifestyle choices, improved technology in diagnostic ECG devices, and high growth rates of ECG device sales.

As of 2015, the United States accounted for approximately 36% of the global ECG market. Assuming this rate remains unchanged, the US portion of the ECG market is expected to be worth approximately $10 billion in 2021 and is comprised of three major segments: resting (non-stress) ECG systems, stress ECG systems, and event monitoring systems.

In the US, MCT tests are primarily conducted through outsourced Independent Diagnostic Testing Facilities (IDTFs) that are reimbursed at an estimated average rate of approximately $850 per diagnostic test, based on pricing information provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and weighted towards the largest markets of New York, California, Texas and Florida. Reimbursement rates can be lower in smaller markets, although the national average is $801. Further, we believe private insurers provide for substantially similar or better reimbursement rates.

We intend to enter our MCT diagnostic device and software solution and compete in the market and employ an insourcing business model. This proposed business model is applicable to a significantly larger portion of the total available market, which include hospitals, physicians offices and other IDTFs. We believe our insourcing model has the benefit of a reduced operating overhead by offering our solution on a pay-per-use basis, enabling a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy.

Our vision is to revolutionize the MCT market by providing a convenient, cost-effective, integrated MCT solution, inclusive of both software and hardware for the providers and the patients. The solution is designed as a platform to encompass all segments of the event monitoring market, and future market growth.

Market Opportunity

ECGs are a key diagnostic test utilized in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. The global ECG market is projected to be worth $28 billion in 2021, and, assuming the U.S. continues to hold approximately 36% of the global market (based on 2015 statistics), approximately $10 billion would be attributed to the US ECG market. In the US in 2012, there were 26.6 million people living with cardiovascular disease with an additional 2.5 million people being diagnosed every year. The increasing market size is attributed to an aging population and an influx in chronic diseases related to lifestyle choices.

The US ECG market is divided into three major product segments:

1.
 Event monitoring systems;

2.
 Stress ECG systems; and

3.
 Resting (non-stress) ECG systems.

Event monitoring systems are projected to grow the fastest due to a shift from in-hospital/clinic monitoring to outpatient monitoring. This shift is expected to help reduce health care costs by limiting the number of overnight hospital stays for patient monitoring. We believe that physicians prefer event monitoring systems over resting and stress ECG systems because they provide better insight to the patients condition for diagnostic purposes.

The event monitoring market is divided into the Holter, Event Loop and Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT) product segments, of which Holter and Event Loop are the current market leaders. Amongst event monitoring systems, we believe that the preferred choice of physicians and cardiologists is MCT, because of its ability to continuously monitor patients in real-time, thereby reducing a patients risk and a physicians liability. MCT devices have built-in arrhythmia detectors and real-time communication, which allow physicians to prescribe the device for a longer period of time; thereby enabling prolonged data collection and delivering a more complete picture for diagnosis.
 
6

We believe that Holter and Event Loop solutions compromise patient safety because they lack the ability to alert the patient in the event of an emergency. With Holter and Event Loop monitoring, ECG data is not uploaded or transmitted in real-time. Comparatively, if the patient were monitored through an MCT device with real-time ECG data transfer and cellular network access, then in the event of cardiac distress, the monitoring center would immediately send communication to the patient.

Despite our belief that MCT is the optimal solution and the preferred system, the MCT Market is the smallest segment of event monitoring systems with an estimated size of approximately $918 million. This is because the reimbursement revenues associated with MCT incentivizes the dominant solution providers to earn the fees independent of the physician. This creates a critical problem in the marketplace where physicians have the choice to either use the Holter/Event monitor, or lose money and prescribe an MCT. An additional option is to incur huge costs to build out MCT capabilities in order to prescribe MCT. As a result, we believe that physicians will mostly prescribe MCT tests on high-risk patients only, where real-time communication is critical.

In order to properly administer the MCT test, a healthcare provider must have access to three essential components:

1.
 The MCT device;

2.
 An ECG reporting software that is capable of reading the data recorded from the device; and

3.
 A monitoring center that collects the ECG data and responds to the patient in case of an alarm detection.

In addition, we believe that there is a shortage in the number of MCT solutions available, as the current MCT diagnostic providers essentially control all of the current MCT devices and software. Since MCT requires an FDA-cleared device (meaning for our purposes that it can be used to review medical ECG data from ECG devices), FDA-cleared ECG reporting software, and remote monitoring capabilities, very few companies have attempted to create an all-encompassing solution due to regulatory and development timelines. We believe that there are currently only 5 MCT solutions within the market, of which there are both solution providers and device manufacturers. There also exists overlap amongst the providers and device manufacturers, leading to further confusion and marketplace complexities.

Of the five MCT systems currently available in the market, three are owned by solution providers (IDTFs) who employ an outsourcing business model and we believe are unwilling to sell to physicians. The other two MCT providers we believe are willing to sell their solution at prohibitively high prices for devices plus upfront software costs and a per test fee for monitoring. One of these MCT devices does not have scalable software; and the other lacks monitoring software, requiring a customer to acquire third party software and incur integration expenses. In these two scenarios, the physician would have to incur upfront costs that would take time to recoup before profits are realized.

The limited number of competitors makes this an attractive market for new entrants. However, entry into the market requires a hardware device coupled with ECG software and access to a monitoring center. Two of the five MCT players have done so by building their own monitoring infrastructure, developing their own ECG software and utilizing TZ Medicals MCT device. However, this is capital intensive and we believe cost prohibitive for most hospitals and clinics. These barriers are in our opinion the key reasons as to why Holter and Event Loop have maintained a significant portion of the $4.66 billion US event monitoring market.
 
7

The Bioflux MCT solution and business model attempts to address these complications with its complete, turn-key solution, which consists of all three essential components: an easy-to-wear GSM-enabled cardiac monitoring device, ECG reporting software, and introduction and access to a third-party 24/7 ECG monitoring center. We have performed an assessment of existing third party monitoring centres and have negotiated agreements with US-based and international third-party monitoring centers to provide monitoring services when requested by customers. Bioflux employs an insourced business model, as the entire Bioflux solution is expected to be free to doctors and revenue is expected to be derived from insurance reimbursable ECG reads. We expect that service providers such as physicians, clinics and/or hospitals can request as many devices as they require, at no cost, provided they are utilized. This creates a revenue model based on usage, with reimbursement to the service provider with amounts then paid to us as a technology vendor and to the monitoring center for their services.
 Our Bioflux MCT solution is comprised of a uniquely designed monitoring device and an ECG reporting software component. We believe the Bioflux solution will:

·
 provide recurring reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and IDTFs;

·
 provide a revenue model that fits within the established insurance billing practices;

·
 provide built-in cellular connectivity, enabling immediate alert to user in the event of an emergency;

·
 provide motion tracking to detect exercise, activity, and disorientation; and

·
 incorporate technology that is future-ready, in that its form and function enables opportunities adjacent to the MCT market.

Following Bioflux, we intend to introduce medical-grade monitoring into the consumer market via our proposed Biolife solution, which we are designing to improve healthcare with technology that aids chronic disease prevention. Biolife is expected to be designed to empower individuals by creating a compliance optimized user experience that combines ECG data and social media interactivity with a lifestyle log. Design and development is already underway, and we are expecting to launch Biolife towards the latter part of 2018.

Market Strategy

The Bioflux MCT device is expected to be deployed into hospitals, clinics, physicians offices and IDTFs, on a pay-per-use basis. The MCT diagnostic read currently is a reimbursable service from payers such as Medicare and insurance companies. In the United States, billing codes for an MCT diagnostic read are currently available under the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminal, with a current average reimbursement rate of $850 per read (a read is between 3 and 14 days long).

We believe that Biofluxs pay-per-use strategy, with no fee for device purchases, is a significant and disruptive departure from the pricing and reimbursement strategies of the five existing competitors in the MCT market, which use a closed-garden model to MCT diagnostics, where the entire procedure and reimbursement is restricted to an outsourced model. The physicians, clinics, hospitals and IDTFs do not receive any financial incentive to switch to the MCT diagnostic, from other non-MCT devices (i.e. Holter and Event Loop recording monitors).

Biofluxs pricing reimbursement strategy is expected to create a barrier to entry for other competitors seeking to emulate our strategy, which would be enabled by planned low-cost manufacturing and the planned useful life of each devise.

The pay-per-use strategy expected to be employed by us provides a financial incentive for the healthcare provider to switch devices or technologies (i.e. from Holter and Event Loop) and other cardiac diagnostic solutions. This strategy simultaneously incentivizes major medical distributors to place multiple devices in our target markets: physicians offices, clinics, hospitals, and IDTFs.

On October 18, 2016, we announced that we have received a 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the software component of our Bioflux solution. We do not expect to require further clearance from the FDA for the final software product delivered to us by CardioComm in December 2016 or for any further design changes, as all key components of the software critical for regulatory review have been submitted to the FDA.

On completion of required testing and submission of results, on December 18, 2017 we announced that we received our second 510(k) clearance for our Bioflux device, thereby achieving the final FDA requirement needed for Biotricity to bring Bioflux to the U.S. market. We have begun to roll-out our first devices to cardiologists, physicians, research scientists and other opinion leaders and on April 6, 2018, we deployed our new Bioflux remote monitoring device to its first customer  a reputed medical practice specializing in diagnosing, treating, managing, and researching diseases and disorders of the heart and vascular system. In 2018 and 2019, we expect to begin widespread distribution, with the addition of a major channel distributor to enable a market penetration of approximately 2,213 physician offices (approximately 1% of all physician offices in the U.S.), 58 hospitals (approximately 1% of all hospitals in the U.S.), and 30 IDTFs (an estimated 1% of all IDTFs in the U.S.).

In November 2016, we announced a partnership with Global to Local (G2L), an organization dedicated to providing programs that improve individual and community health outcomes, expand access to healthcare services, and empower economic development in the most diverse and underserved communities. The collaboration between Biotricity and G2L will initially focus on building innovative solutions for outcome measurements for individuals suffering from chronic disease. Our partnership with G2L is expected to help develop the next generation of chronic care solutions that address the gaps identified in existing solutions, like underserved populations which face barriers to basic health and economic resources, including a lack of access to preventative care. Under the term of our partnership and collaboration agreement with G2L our partnership may be terminated at any time on 60 days notice and there are no payment obligations between us and G2L. Any payment obligations between us and G2L will be negotiated by the Company and G2L. 

Through informal discussions with a limited number of cardiologists and electrophysiologists, we believe that our insourcing business model will be successful and will lead to end-users and payers switching to our MCT device from existing modalities, and accepting ongoing fees related to providing the technology platform, data charges and support; however, [except for SAEHi none of such cardiologists or electrophysiologists have committed to do so, and we have no definitive agreements in place with any end-users and payors]. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that any of them will in fact follow through as they indicated or that our business model will prove successful once launched.

Product and Technology

Bioflux is an advanced, integrated ECG device and software solution for the MCT market. The Bioflux device is comprised of a wet electrode and worn either on a lanyard around the neck or on a belt clip around the waist. The Bioflux ECG reporting software will allow doctors and labs to view a patients ECG data for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. Both the device and software are in accordance with MCT billing code standards, compliant with arrhythmia devices and alarms as defined by the FDA, and require 510(k) clearance, which has been obtained.
 The Bioflux device has been developed, among other things, with the following features:

·
 GSM mobile chip for global cellular network compatibility;

·
 Touch-screen LCD viewer; and

·
 Extended battery pack for an additional 48 hours of battery life.
 
9

The Bioflux platform has a built-in cellular chipset and a real-time embedded operating system which allows for our technology to be utilized as an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. This technology can be leveraged into other applications and industries by utilizing the platform and OS side of Bioflux.

Our ECG software component is a customized solution based on what we believe is the only FDA cleared ECG viewer software for use in MCT, from CardioComm Solutions Inc. CardioComms ECG viewer software, which our software is based on, is already installed and utilized by approximately 300 hospitals and call centers, and we believe we can leverage this familiarity to gain access to decision makers at such hospitals and call centers and introduce the Bioflux device quickly and efficiently into the marketplace. We are integrating the ECG reporting software with the Bioflux device for a seamless user experience.

Future Markets

It is widely reported that chronic illnesses related to lifestyle diseases are on the rise, resulting in increased healthcare costs. This has caused a major shift in the US healthcare market, emphasizing a need for evidence based healthcare system focused on overall health outcomes. Patient compliance is a critical component in driving improved health outcomes, where the patient adheres to and implements their physicians recommendation. Unfortunately, poor patient compliance is one of the most pressing issues in the healthcare market. One of the key contributing factors to this is the lack of a feedback mechanism to measure improvement and knowledge. Studies show that poor patient compliance costs the US healthcare system $100 to $300 billion annually, representing 3% to 10% of total US healthcare costs.

The above trends point to a need for preventative care solutions that are clinically relevant and designed for the consumer to promote compliance. Current consumer products are simple gadgets with limited, if any, clinical relevance. This forces patients to rely on clinical visits to gauge improvement, with time between visits being spent on following and implementing physician recommendations. Research has shown that the latter is closely linked to non-compliance due to the lack of feedback to patients.

We expect that Biolife, our planned second product, will be focused on filling this need by developing a clinically relevant, preventative care and disease management solution for the consumer. A key underlying component of Biolife is expected to be the ability to measure patient improvementswith clinical accuracywhich will drive feedback and eventual patient compliance. This approach is implemented in our development process by focusing on a disease/chronic illness profile, as opposed to a customer profile. We are focused on cardiovascular disease for its first preventative care solution since Bioflux is aimed at the same health segment. This will enable us to leverage the knowledge and expertise gained with Bioflux and apply it to Biolife.

Preventative Care

The preventative care market (also referred to as the health and wellness market) was estimated to be valued at $452 billion in 2015. The preventative care market segments include: core diagnostic market and therapeutics ($42 billion), personalized medical care ($100 billion) and nutrition and wellness ($310 billion).

With the knowledge and expertise gained during the development of the Bioflux MCT solution, we have developed a secondary device, Biolife, aimed at the preventative consumer healthcare market. Biolife is a health and lifestyle solution comprised of an ECG monitoring device, an app, and social media support. Biolife will track, simplify and generate a users health pattern score by aggregating medical grade ECG data with a lifestyle log. The idea is to provide real-time feedback and a social support system, so that the individual is motivated to be proactive about preventing adverse cardiac complications.

Biolifes target market are individuals between 45 to 75, and those at risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic health illnesses who want the support of making lifestyle changes to have a better quality of life.
 
10

We are currently prepared to enter future markets for users that are interested in:

·
 Self-management of cardiovascular disease and other related chronic diseases;

·
 Users seeking lifestyle and wellness applications for remote ECG monitoring; and

·
 Users seeking a predictive and prognostic solution using ECG (known as Heart Rate Variability).

Adjacent Chronic Healthcare Markets and Prenatal Care

In the next few years, we intend to expand our reach with medical-grade solutions for diabetes, sleep apnea, fetal monitoring, and other adjacent healthcare and lifestyle markets.

Bionatal is a proposed solution for monitoring the fetus health by remote cardiac monitoring. In the US, there are approximately 60,000 fetal deaths per year. First time mothers are at the greatest risk for still births, approximating 20% of 840,000 pregnancies. Bionatals fetal ECG monitoring solution has a total market of $2.3 million, with an initial target of 900,000 pregnancies.

Event Monitoring

The Holter and Event Loop monitors are significantly simplified versions of an MCT device without a cellular connectivity solution. Holter and Event Loop monitors require data to be downloaded manually, for test periods of 24 hours to 30 days. With just a few adjustments to the software, Biofluxs MCT device is expected to be able to be used as a Holter or an Event loop monitor, which would open up the entire Holter and Event Loop monitor markets which have been estimated to be $3.7 billion in 2020. Combined with Biofluxs global cellular chipset, the Bioflux MCT device can become a 3 in 1 device that is applicable to the global event monitoring market. Bioflux intends to offer this complete solution to its three target markets: physicians, clinics/hospitals and IDTFs, which includes the Bioflux MCT device, Bioflux ECG reporting software, and access to a third party ECG monitoring center. We do not expect for there to be any cost to any of our customers for the device itself, as our entire revenue is expected to be derived from the pay-per-use service.
Competition

The medical technology equipment industry is characterized by strong competition and rapid technological change. There are a number of companies developing technologies that are competitive to our existing and proposed products, many of them, when compared to our Company, having significantly longer operational history and greater financial and other resources.
 
11

Within the US event monitoring systems market, the MCT product segment is comprised of 5 main competitors that we are aware of. These competitors have increased market presence and distribution primarily through existing IDTFs. The existing competitors have maintained a competitive advantage within the market by controlling the distribution of all available MCT devices and software solutions. Our primary competitors in the MCT market are:

·
 Biotelemetry (formerlyCardioNet). We believe that CardioNet, LLC, a subsidiary of BioTelemetry, Inc. (NASDAQ:BEAT), has the largest network of IDTFs within the MCT market. CardioNet is considered a complete solution provider as it produces and distributes its own MCT device, software solution, and MCT monitoring centers. The company acquired its MCT device through the acquisition of a MCT manufacturer, Braemar. Upon acquisition of Braemar, CardioNet offered limited support to other clients utilizing Braemars technology. This resulted in CardioNet increasing the use of its device and software solution, enabling wide market penetration. We believe that CardioNets business model is focused on providing the MCT diagnostic service, as opposed to selling MCT solutions to other IDTFs or service providers, which enables a perpetual per-read fee as opposed to one time device or software sales. Equity research analysts categorize CardioNet as a clinical health provider, because of its business model, rather than as a medical device company. As such, we believe that CardioNets market cap is limited by the low multiples associated with that type of business, and, as a clinical health provider, CardioNet has significant overhead and fixed costs associated with monitoring centers and health professionals.

·
 LifeWatch AG (Acquired by Biotelemtry). LifeWatchAG (SIX Swiss Exchange:LIFE) is a public company with primary operations in Switzerland, the United States and Israel. LifeWatch operates a large network of IDTFs. LifeWatch is smaller relative to CardioNet, yet we believe it follows the same business model. To this end, LifeWatch has developed its own MCT device and software solution, as well as established MCT monitoring centers.

·
 Preventice (formerly eCardio.)  eCardio is a private company, based in Houston, Texas. eCardios device is manufactured by a third party medical device company, TZ Medical. eCardio has integrated TZ Medicals device with its software solution to create a complete MCT solution. Similar to LifeWatch and CardioNet, we believe eCardio follows the same business model of offering the MCT service and acting as a clinical health provider.

·
 Linecare. Linecare is a private company, based in Clearwater, Florida. We believe that Linecares main focus is respiratory care, but it also has franchises in diagnostic care, including the MCT product segment of the ECG monitoring market. Linecare has followed a similar approach as eCardio, where they have integrated TZ Medicals device into their software solution to offer a complete MCT service. Similarly, it acts as a clinical health provider and offers its MCT service as an outsourced offering to the physician.

·
 ScottCare. ScottCare is a private company in the US and a subsidiary of Scott Fetzer Company, a division of Berkshire Hathaway. ScottCare provides equipment for cardiovascular clinics and diagnostic technicians. ScottCare has built its own MCT device and software solution. Unlike the others, ScottCare offers its solution in an insourced model, where the physician has the opportunity to bill. This model requires the physician to purchase a minimum number of devices at an approximate average cost of $2,000 and their software at a cost of $25,000 to $40,000. After this initial upfront cost, ScottCare charges an additional per test fee for monitoring. We believe the above model creates a long return on investment for the physician. In our opinion, this has resulted in little market penetration for ScottCare as compared to the others.
 
12

In addition, we note that:

·
 Medtronic. Medtronic is a major medical device conglomerate. It has an MCT solution by the name of SEEQ that was added to their portfolio through the acquisition of Corventis. We have seen no significant activity or usage with SEEQ in our market analysis. We also note that SEEQ is a patch based MCT solution that only collects data on 1 lead. As such, it has strong competition from 3 lead systems which are the standard for MCT. In early 2018, Medtronic withdrew SEEQ from the marketplace. We do not view Medtronic as a primary competitor, but, given the size and reach of Medtronic, they are an organization that we must continuously watch and be aware of.

·
 TZ Medical. TZ Medical is a medical device company that focuses on manufacturing a variety of medical devices. We do not consider TZ Medical to be a direct competitor as they produce an MCT device that is available for purchase, such as to eCardio as described above. However, we do not believe that TZ Medical has a software solution, requiring any new entrant to either acquire or build out a software solution and then integrate that with the TZ Medical device. This creates a requirement for a large upfront capital investment. As a result, we believe this approach only works for organizations looking to become MCT solution providers with the same business model as the others.

We believe that our Bioflux MCT solution will successfully compete because:

·
 it is designed as a platform to encompass all segments of the event monitoring market;

·
 of the insourcing business model which we believe is applicable to a significantly larger portion of the total available market and enable more efficient strategic penetration and distribution; and

·
 for the other reasons described earlier under Market Opportunity.

Intellectual Property

We primarily rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.

We acquired a customized version FDA cleared ECG reporting software, for use in MCT, from CardioComm Solutions Inc. Use of this software is exclusive to Bioflux for the MCT market, except that CardioComm may continue to work with its pre-existing relationships in respect to existing MCT Solutions, including TZ Medical; however, we do not believe that any of such pre-existing relationships have incorporated CardioComms software in their solutions at this time. The exclusivity is indefinite unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement, including termination by CardioComm if we fail to remain current in the payment of applicable royalty fees. Now that CardioComm has delivered the final software to us, and given that we have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, we will be required to pay a royalty fee equal to a $20.00 ECG cardio-scan fee, on a per patient and an as-collected basis, managed through the software, provided that the minimum annual royalty fee shall be $75,000 for the first year and $150,000 per annum thereafter. 

We have and generally plan to continue to enter into non-disclosure, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with all new employees as a condition of employment. In addition, we intend to also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
13

We also may from time to time rely on other intellectual property developed or acquired, including patents, technical innovations, laws of unfair competition and various other licensing agreements to provide our future growth and to build our competitive position. We have filed an industrial design patent in Canada, and we may decide to file for additional patents as we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent or other rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.

Currently, we do not have any registered copyrights; however, we may obtain such registrations in the future.

Research and Development

Our research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us in California and Toronto on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies.

The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed products, to enhance the commercial value of such products.

We incurred research and development costs of $1,762,561 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, and $1,138,252 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. 

Government Regulation

General

Our proposed product is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of the our medical device products.

In addition to those indicated below, the only other regulations we encounter are regulations that are common to all businesses, such as employment legislation, implied warranty laws, and environmental, health and safety standards, to the extent applicable. We will also encounter in the future industry-specific government regulations that would govern our products, if and when developed for commercial use. It may become the case that other regulatory approvals will be required for the design and manufacture of our products and proposed products.

U.S. Regulation

The FDA governs the following activities that Biotricity performs, will perform, upon the clearance or approval of its product candidates, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:

·
 product design, and development;

·
 product safety, testing, labeling and storage;

·
 record keeping procedures; and

·
 product marketing.
 
14

There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the approval or clearance and subsequent commercial marketing of Biotricitys products. These include:

·
 the timely submission of product listing and establishment registration information, along with associated establishment user fees;

·
 continued compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which require specification developers and manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;

·
 labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;

·
 clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that would constitute a major change in intended use;

·
 Medical Device Reporting regulations (MDR), which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;

·
 adequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same;

·
 post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;

·
 post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and

·
 notices of correction or removal and recall regulations.

Unless an exemption applies, before Biotricity can commercially distribute medical devices in the United States, it must obtain, depending on the classification of the device, either prior 510(k) clearance, 510(k) de-novo clearance or premarket approval (PMA), from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of regulatory controls needed to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness:

Class I devices, which are low risk and subject to only general controls (e.g., registration and listing, medical device labeling compliance, MDRs, Quality System Regulations, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding) and, in some cases, to the 510(k) premarket clearance requirements;

Class II devices, which are moderate risk and generally require 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the United States as well as general controls and potentially special controls like performance standards or specific labeling requirements; and

Class III devices, which are devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Class III devices generally require the submission and approval of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. 
 
15

The custom software and hardware of our products are classified as Class II. Class II devices are those for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient histories and FDA guidance documents. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for these devices is generally accomplished through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo premarket notification process. As part of the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo notification process, the FDA may have required the following:

·
 Development of comprehensive product description and indications for use.

·
 Completion of extensive preclinical tests and preclinical animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.

·
 Comprehensive review of predicate devices and development of data supporting the new products substantial equivalence to one or more predicate devices.

·
 If appropriate and required, certain types of clinical trials (IDE submission and approval may be required for conducting a clinical trial in the US).

Clinical trials involve use of the medical device on human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent for their participation in the clinical study. A written protocol with predefined end points, an appropriate sample size and pre-determined patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, is required before initiating and conducting a clinical trial. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations that among other things, govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a significant risk, as defined by the FDA, the agency requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA denies the application or notifies the company that the investigation is on hold and may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE that requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but it must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements.

Given successful completion of all required testing, a detailed 510(k) premarket notification or 510(k) de-novo was submitted to the FDA requesting clearance to market the product. The notification included all relevant data from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the products manufacturing controls and proposed labeling, and other relevant documentation.

A 510(k) clearance letter from the FDA then authorized commercial marketing of the device for one or more specific indications of use.

After 510(k) clearance, Biotricity is required to comply with a number of post-clearance requirements, including, but not limited to, Medical Device Reporting and complaint handling, and, if applicable, reporting of corrective actions. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to QSRs. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with QSRs, which impose extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements on medical device manufacturers. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the change, validation activities may need to be performed. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with QSRs and other types of regulatory controls.
 
16

After a device receives 510(k) clearance from FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use or technological characteristics, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make the determination of whether a modification requires a new 510(k) notification or PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturers decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for a particular change, the FDA may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease U.S. marketing and/or recall the modified device until additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.

The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, will also regulate the advertising claims of Biotricitys products to ensure that the claims it makes are consistent with its regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that product advertising is neither false nor misleading.

We received 510(k) clearance for both the software and hardware components of our Bioflux product. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a notification to the FDA demonstrating that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device (i.e., a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or Class II, or a 510(k)-cleared device). The FDAs 510(k) clearance process generally takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted but also can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device or its intended use is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the device is automatically placed into Class III, requiring the submission of a PMA. Once the information is submitted, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant a company 510(k) clearance for its pipeline products, and failure to obtain the necessary clearances for its products would adversely affect its ability to grow its business. Delays in receipt or failure to receive the necessary clearances, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce its business prospects.

Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process due to lack of a predicate device but would be considered low or moderate risk may be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo process. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, or FDAMA added the de novo classification pathway now codified in section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. This law established an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent, or NSE, determination in response to a 510(k) submission. Through this regulatory process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receipt, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device through what is called a de novo request. In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), in order to provide a second option for de novo classification. Under this second pathway, a sponsor who determines that there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence can submit a de novo request to FDA without first submitting a 510(k).

In the event that a company receives a Not Substantially Equivalent determination for its candidates in response to a 510(k) submission, the device may still be eligible for the 510(k) de-novo classification process.

Devices that cannot be cleared through the 510(k) or 510(k) de-novo classification process require the submission of a PMA. The PMA process is much more time consuming and demanding than the 510(k) notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from preclinical and/or clinical studies and data relating to manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDAs satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. After a PMA application is submitted, the FDAs in-depth review of the information generally takes between one and three years and may take significantly longer. If the FDA does not grant 510(k) clearance to its future products, there is no guarantee that Biotricity will submit a PMA or that if it does, that the FDA would grant a PMA approval of Biotricitys future products, either of which would adversely affect Biotricitys business.
 
17

We also need to establish a suitable and effective quality management system, which establishes controlled processes for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution. We plan to do this in compliance with the internationally recognized standard ISO 13485:2013 Medical Devices  Quality Management Systems  Requirements for Regulatory Purposes. Following the introduction of a product, the FDA and foreign agencies engage in periodic reviews of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in our product development processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.

Foreign Regulation

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Manufacturing and Suppliers

Until recently, we have focused primarily on research and development of the first generation version of the Bioflux, as well as starting the prototyping of Biolife and proposed marketing and distribution, we are not yet at a stage to commence volume production of our products. We currently assemble our devices at our Redwood City, California facility. In order to maintain compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing facilities must be periodically re-evaluated and qualified under a quality system to ensure they meet production and quality standards. Suppliers of components and products used to manufacture our devices must also comply with FDA regulatory requirements, which often require significant resources and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages.

We have a scalable manufacturing strategy and goals and use Providence Enterprises, which is an FDA qualified manufacturer for contract manufacturing. We do not have a contract with Providence or any obligation to use them (nor do they have any obligations with respect to us other than with respect to any specific orders we may make) and we enter into purchase orders for each manufacturing request we have with Providence, as we would with other vendors. Despite our working relationship with Providence, we intend to continue to identify and develop other efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and options to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards or production volumes required to successfully mass market our products, especially at the low-cost levels we require to facilitate and absorb the near-free distribution of our products pursuant to our proposed business plan. 
 
18

We currently rely on a number of principal suppliers for the components that make up our products and proposed products; these include Digikey Corporation and Mouser Electronics for electronics and connectors, Stolmann for Bluetooth modules, Yongan Innovations for batteries, Dongguan Bole RP&M Cp. Ltd. for plastics, Unimed Medical for ECG cables, and Medico Systems for touch-panel LCD displays. We believe that the raw materials used or expected to be used in our planned products can be acquired from multiple sources and are readily available on the market.

Employees
 We currently have 11 full-time employees and approximately 20 consultants who are based in our offices located in Toronto, Canada and Silicon Valley, California. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company and, with the consultants, support management, engineering, manufacturing, and administration. We have no unionized employees.
 Based on funding ability, we currently plan to hire 20 to 30 additional full-time employees within the next 12 months, whose principal responsibilities will be the support of our sales, marketing, research and development, and clinical development activities.
 We consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
 Appointment to Board of Advisors
 In November 2016, we appointed Dr. Rony Shimony to our Board of Advisors. Mr. Shimony is an internationally recognized clinical cardiologist who brings over 25 years of experience in cardiac patient care and related technology to the Company. Dr. Shimony, MD, FACC and Associate Profession or Medicine and Cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, brings vast knowledge and expertise in Cardiovascular Disease to Biotricity, and will help advise the Company as we develop and roll out our innovative biometric device for planned future commercialization. Dr. Shimony joins the existing members of the Board of Advisors  Dr. David Liepert, Thomas Nelson, Bernard Rice, John Rother and Danny Sands  and is expected to assist in guiding the Company on its growth and product development to positively affect patient outcomes.
