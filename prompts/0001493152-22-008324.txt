ITEM 1. | Business
----------------------------------------------------+---------

GENERAL
 
AIM ImmunoTech Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “AIM”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) are an immuno-pharma company headquartered in Ocala, Florida, and focused on the research and development of therapeutics to treat multiple types of cancers, viral diseases and immune-deficiency disorders. We have established a strong foundation of laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids and natural interferon to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body, and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain cancers and chronic diseases.
 
Our flagship products are Ampligen® (rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and Alferon N Injection® (Interferon Alfa-N3). Ampligen has not been approved by the FDA or marketed in the United States. Ampligen is approved for commercial sale in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”).
 
Our primary present business focus involves Ampligen. Ampligen represents a dsRNA being developed for globally important cancers, viral diseases and disorders of the immune system.
 
We currently are proceeding primarily in four areas:
 

● | A randomized controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of Ampligen compared to a control group to treat locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Evaluate Ampligen in other cancers, as a potential therapy that modifies the tumor microenvironment with the goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to check point inhibitors. 
● | Exploring Ampligen’s antiviral activities and potential use as a prophylactic or treatment for existing viruses, new viruses and mutated viruses thereof. 
● | Ampligen as a treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (“ME/CFS”) and fatigue and/or difficulty thinking/concentrating as the predominate Post-COVID conditions (as referenced on CDC website Sept. 16, 2021). 

 
We are prioritizing our activities in an order related to the stage of development, with those clinical activities such as pancreatic cancer, ME/CFS and Post-COVID conditions having priority over antiviral experimentation. We intend that priority clinical work be conducted in FDA- or EMA-authorized trials which could support a potential future New Drug Application (“NDA”). However, our antiviral experimentation is designed to accumulate additional preliminary data supporting our hypothesis that Ampligen is a powerful, broad-spectrum prophylaxis and early-onset therapeutic that may confer enhanced immunity and cross-protection. Accordingly, we will conduct our antiviral programs in those venues most readily available and able to generate valid proof-of-concept data, including foreign venues.
 
Immuno-Oncology.
 
We are focused on pancreatic cancer because testing results, to date, primarily conducted in the Netherlands, have been very promising. The Netherlands study generated statistically significant data indicating that Ampligen extended survival well beyond the Standard of Care (“SOC”). These data support the proposition that Ampligen, when administered in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer after systemic chemotherapy showed a statistically significant increase in survival rate. In October 2021, we and our Contract Research Organization, Amarex Clinical Research LLC (“Amarex”), submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for a planned Phase 2 study of Ampligen as a therapy for locally advanced or metastatic late-stage pancreatic cancer. The FDA placed the study on Clinical Hold in November 2021 and provided valuable feedback on the study design. We submitted our response to the Clinical Hold in February 2022. In March 2022, we received notification from the FDA that the Clinical Hold was released and cleared, meaning that we are now able to proceed with the study. Assuming this trial and subsequent planned clinical trials confirm the existing data, our goal is to then submit an NDA for use of Ampligen in pancreatic cancer patients.
 
Ampligen has also demonstrated in the clinic the potential for standalone efficacy in a number of solid tumors. We have also seen success in increasing survival rates and efficacy in the treatment of animal tumors when Ampligen is used in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies. In fact, in March 2022 we announced interim data from an investigator-initiated, Phase 2, single-arm, efficacy/safety trial to evaluate the effectiveness of combining intensive locoregional intraperitoneal (IP) chemoimmunotherapy of cisplatin with IP Ampligen (TLR-3 agonist) and IV infusion of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (IVP) for patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. We believe that data from the study, which is being conducted by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, demonstrated that when combining three drugs – Ampligen and pembrolizumab, which are both immune therapies, with cisplatin, a chemotherapy – evidence of increased biomarkers associated with T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function has been seen. Importantly, increases of these biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment have been correlated with favorable tumor responses. These successes in the field of immuno-oncology have guided our efforts toward the potential use of Ampligen as a combinational therapy for the treatment of a variety of solid tumor types. The first of our patent applications in this space was granted by the Netherlands on March 15, 2021.

Ampligen as an Antiviral.
 
We have a research and pre-clinical history that indicates broad-spectrum antiviral capability of Ampligen in animals. We hope to demonstrate that it has the same effect in humans. To do this, among other things, we need a population infected with a virus. That is why we have spent significant resources on COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) which is active and still infecting many subjects. While much would need to be done to get Ampligen to market as a broad-spectrum antiviral, we believe that it is important to focus our efforts first and foremost on thoroughly proving the concept, especially while there is still a large COVID-19-infected population. Previously, animal studies were conducted that yielded positive results utilizing Ampligen to treat Western Equine Encephalitis Virus, Ebola and SARS-CoV-1. We have conducted experiments in SARS-CoV-2 showing Ampligen has a powerful impact on viral replication. The prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against SARS-CoV-2.
 
The FDA has requested that we provide additional data to assist the agency in evaluating the potential risks and benefits of administering Ampligen to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 individuals. However, as discussed in more detail below, where the threat to the patient from COVID-19 is high, the FDA has already authorized Ampligen in a clinical trial of patients with COVID-19 who have a pre-existing cancer. That Phase 1/2a study utilizing Ampligen is underway. We have also elected to explore studies (initially with healthy volunteers) outside the United States, and have already conducted an intranasal safety study in the Netherlands.
 
In this regard, the Centre for Human Drug Research (“CHDR”), a foundation located in Leiden in the Netherlands, managed a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind study for us to evaluate the safety, tolerability and biological activity of repeated administration of Ampligen intranasally. A total of 40 healthy subjects received either Ampligen or a placebo in the trial, with the Ampligen given at four escalating dosages across four cohorts, to a maximum level of 1,250 micrograms. All patients had completed treatment by June 2021 and the Final Safety Report reported no Serious or Severe Adverse Events at any dosage level.
 
Following the completion of the Phase 1 dosing in the CHDR managed study, and based on its positive interim results, we engaged hVIVO to conduct a Human Challenge Trial (“HCT”) at their quarantine facility in the U.K. to test Ampligen as a potential intranasal antiviral therapy using a human Rhinovirus hRV (common cold virus) and Influenza. The REC provided a “favorable opinion” to proceed, but the MHRA issued a Non-Acceptance response in November 2021. A full revised application was resubmitted in December 2021. The MHRA issued Grounds for Non-Acceptance and requested additional data before moving forward. As the request would require us to first conduct an animal experiment that we believe would take approximately six months to complete, we determined that continuing with the HCT application process would not be a prudent use of our resources, so we terminated our agreement with hVIVO and officially notified the MHRA of our decision to withdraw our application. As the MHRA’s Grounds for Non-Acceptance had already been issued, our withdrawal was technically recognized as a rejection of the proposed study.
 
Today, some two years after COVID-19 first appeared, the world has a number of vaccines and some promising therapeutics. Our quest to prove the antiviral activities of Ampligen continues. If Ampligen has the broad-spectrum antiviral properties that we believe that it has, it could be a very valuable tool in treating variants of existing viral diseases, including COVID-19, or novel ones that arise in the future. Unlike most developing therapeutics which attack the virus, Ampligen works differently. We believe that it activates antiviral immune system pathways that fight not just a particular virus or viral variant, but other similar viruses as well.
 
Please see “Ampligen as a Potential Antiviral” below.
 
Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS and Post-COVID Conditions
 
We have long been focused on seeking the FDA’s approval for the use of Ampligen to treat ME/CFS. In fact, in February 2013, we received a Complete Response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for our Ampligen NDA for ME/CFS, stating that we should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses.
 
While developing a comprehensive response to the FDA and a plan for a confirmatory trial for the FDA NDA, we proceeded independently in Argentina and, in August 2016, we received approval of an NDA from Administracion Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnologia Medica (“ANMAT”) for commercial sale of Ampligen in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. On June 10, 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. The next steps in the commercial launch of Ampligen include ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. This testing and approval process is currently delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ANMAT’s internal processes. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 in Argentina is taxing the nation’s health care system and is, understandably, the main priority of its regulators. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina.

The FDA authorized an open-label treatment protocol (“AMP-511”) allowing patient access to Ampligen for treatment in a study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen to treat this very serious and chronic condition. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through a consortium group of clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen in patients with CFS. The AMP-511 protocol is ongoing. In October 2020, we received Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 protocol to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms that we referred to as Post-COVID-19 chronic fatigue. As of December 31, 2021, there are 11 patients enrolled in this open-label expanded access treatment protocol (including 2 post-COVID-19 patients with cognitive dysfunction). Early data from the ongoing AMP-511 Expanded Access Program has indicated that patients with cognitive function deficiency have reported improvements in cognitive function after Ampligen treatment.
 
We plan on a comprehensive follow through with the FDA regarding the use of Ampligen as a treatment for ME/CFS. We have learned a great deal since the FDA’s CRL and plan to adjust our approach to concentrate on specific ME/CFS symptoms. Responses to the CRL and a proposed confirmatory trial are being worked on now by our R&D team and consultants.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
 
Certain statements in this Report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the Exchange Act. These statements are based on our management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions about future events, conditions and results and on information currently available to us. Discussions containing these forward-looking statements may be found, among other places, in this “Risk Factors” section; Item 1. “Business”, Part I; Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Part II; Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 
All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included or incorporated herein regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, future revenues, projected costs, plans, prospects and objectives are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “think,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “continue,” “potential,” “likely,” “opportunity” and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements.
 
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are risks and uncertainties inherent in our business including, without limitation: our ability to adequately fund our projects as we will need additional funding to proceed with our objectives, the potential therapeutic effect of our products, the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval, our ability to find senior co-development partners with the capital and expertise needed to commercialize our products and to enter into arrangements with them on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to manufacture and sell any products, our ability to enter into arrangements with third party vendors, market acceptance of our products, our ability to earn a profit from sales or licenses of any drugs, our ability to discover new drugs in the future, changing market conditions, changes in laws and regulations affecting our industry, and issues related to our New Brunswick, New Jersey facility.
 
We are in various stages of seeking to determine whether Ampligen will be effective in the treatment of multiple types of viral diseases, cancers, and immune-deficiency disorders. We discuss in this Report our current and anticipated future activities, all of which are subject to change for a number of reasons. Significant testing and trials will be required to determine whether Ampligen will be effective in the treatment of these conditions. Results obtained in animal models do not necessarily predict results in humans. Human clinical trials will be necessary to prove whether or not Ampligen will be efficacious in humans. No assurance can be given as to whether current or planned clinical trials will be successful or yield favorable data and the trials are subject to many factors including lack of regulatory approval(s), lack of study drug, or a change in priorities at the institutions sponsoring other trials. In addition, initiation of planned clinical trials may not occur secondary to many factors including lack of regulatory approval(s) or lack of study drug. Even if these clinical trials are initiated, we cannot assure that the clinical studies will be successful or yield any useful data or require additional funding.
 
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus and our prior research into Ampligen’s antiviral activity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, we now are focusing on the potential of Ampligen to serve as a protective prophylaxis and an early-onset therapeutic for severe respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Our beliefs rely on a number of studies. No assurance can be given that future studies will not result in findings that are different from those reported in the studies we refer to. The pandemic is disrupting world health and world economies and most likely will continue to do so for a long time. While we are able to continue to operate, clearly, like all businesses, we are unable to gauge how bad this pandemic will affect our operations in the future. We reached out to numerous foreign governments related to COVID-19 and, if successful, will be working in these countries. Operating in foreign countries carries with it a number of risks, including potential difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that our potential operations in foreign countries will not be adversely affected by these risks. We have filed provisional patent applications related to the COVID-19 coronavirus. However, these filings do not assure that patents will ultimately be granted.

In February 2013, we received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our Ampligen New Drug Application, or NDA, for the treatment of CFS. The FDA communicated that we should conduct at least one additional clinical trial, complete various nonclinical studies and perform a number of data analyses. Accordingly, the remaining steps to potentially gain FDA approval of the Ampligen NDA, the final results of these and other ongoing activities could vary materially from our expectations and could adversely affect the chances for approval of the Ampligen NDA. These activities and the ultimate outcomes are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to risks that (i) the FDA may ask for additional data, information or studies to be completed or provided; and (ii) the FDA may require additional work related to the commercial manufacturing process to be completed or may, in the course of the inspection of manufacturing facilities, identify issues to be resolved. A proposed confirmatory trial and responses to the CRL are being worked on now by our R&D team and consultants.
 
In August 2016, we received approval of our NDA from Administracion Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnologia Medica, or ANMAT, for commercial sale of rintatolimod (U.S. tradename: Ampligen®) in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. The product will be marketed by GP Pharm, our commercial partner in Latin America. We believe, but cannot assure, that this approval provides a platform for potential sales in certain countries within the European Union under regulations that support cross-border pharmaceutical sales of licensed drugs. In Europe, approval in a country with a stringent regulatory process in place, such as Argentina, should add further validation for the product as the Early Access Program, or EAP, as discussed below and underway in Europe in pancreatic cancer. ANMAT approval is only an initial, but important, step in the overall successful commercialization of our product. There are a number of actions that must occur before we could be able to commence commercial sales in Argentina. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. We are currently working with GP Pharma on the commercial launch of Ampligen in Argentina. Commercialization in Argentina will require, among other things, an appropriate reimbursement level, appropriate marketing strategies, completion of manufacturing preparations for launch and ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. This testing and approval process is currently delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ANMAT’s internal processes. Approval of rintatolimod for severe CFS in the Argentine Republic does not in any way suggest that the Ampligen NDA in the United States or any comparable application filed in the European Union or elsewhere will obtain commercial approval.
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with myTomorrows, a Netherlands based company, for the commencement and management of an EAP in Europe and Turkey related to CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, myTomorrows, as our exclusive service provider and distributor in this territory, is performing EAP activities. In January 2017, the EAP was extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. In February 2018, we signed an amendment to extend the territory to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval. In March 2018, we signed an amendment to which myTomorrows will be our exclusive service provider for special access activities in Canada for the supply of Ampligen for the treatment of CFS. MyTomorrows provides services related to the supply and distribution of Ampligen to patients in Early Access Programs (EAP) which is initiated through a physician’s request; there have been no physician requests that have led to government approval, therefore no patients have been treated under an EAP for either pancreatic cancer or CFS in Canada. No assurance can be given that we can sufficiently supply product should we experience an unexpected demand for Ampligen in our clinical studies, the commercial launch in Argentina or pursuant to the EAPs. No assurance can be given that Ampligen will prove effective in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
 
Multiple Ampligen clinical trials are underway, in various phases of development and activity, with a number of subjects enrolled at university cancer centers testing whether tumor microenvironments can be reprogrammed to increase the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, including checkpoint blockade. One site of clinical trials is Roswell Park and the other is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. (See: “Research and Development; Immuno-oncology and Pancreatic Cancer”). No assurance can be given as to the results of these underway trials. No assurance can be given as to whether some or all of the planned additional oncology clinical trials will occur and they are subject to many factors, including lack of regulatory approval(s), lack of study drug, or a change in priorities at the sponsoring universities or cancer centers. Even if these additional clinical trials are initiated, as we are not the sponsor, we cannot assure that these clinical studies or the studies underway will be successful or yield any useful data. In addition, initiation of planned clinical trials may not occur secondary to many factors including lack of regulatory approval(s) or lack of study drug. Even if these clinical trials are initiated, we cannot assure that the clinical studies will be successful or yield any useful data or require additional funding.

Our overall objectives include plans to continue seeking approval for commercialization of Ampligen in the United States and abroad as well as seeking to broaden commercial therapeutic indications for Alferon N Injection presently approved in the United States and Argentina. We continue to pursue senior co-development partners with the capital and expertise needed to commercialize our products and to enter into arrangements with them on commercially reasonable terms. Our ability to commercialize our products, widen commercial therapeutic indications of Alferon N Injection and/or capitalize on our collaborations with research laboratories to examine our products are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to our, ability to enter into more definitive agreements with some of the research laboratories and others that we are collaborating with, to fund and conduct additional testing and studies, whether or not such testing is successful or requires additional testing and meets the requirements of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. We do not know when, if ever, our products will be generally available for commercial sale for any indication.
 
We strived to maximize the outsourcing of certain components of our manufacturing, quality control, marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance and regulatory groups. We cannot provide any guarantee that the facility or our contract manufacturers will pass an FDA pre-approval inspection for Alferon N Injection manufacturing.
 
The production of new Alferon N Injection Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, or API, is currently on hold. While the New Brunswick facility is approved by the FDA under the Biological License Application, or BLA, for Alferon N Injection, and we intend to maintain a certain amount of space at the to-be-sold facility, the sale of the facility — announced in March 2022 — will move up the timeline for contracting with a CMO, or CMOs, capable of producing Alferon, and receiving FDA approval to do so, prior to commercial sale of newly produced inventory product. If and when we obtain a reaffirmation of FDA BLA status and have begun production of new Alferon N Injection API, it will need FDA approval as to the quality and stability of the final product before commercial sales can resume. We may need additional funds to finance the validation process. If we are unable to gain the necessary FDA approvals related to the manufacturing process and/or final product of new Alferon N Injection inventory, our operations most likely will be materially and/or adversely affected. In light of these contingencies, there can be no assurances that the approved Alferon N Injection product will be returned to production on a timely basis, if at all, or that if and when it is again made commercially available, it will return to prior sales levels.
 
In December 2020, we added Pharmaceutics International Inc. (“Pii”) as a “Fill & Finish” provider to enhance our capacity to produce Ampligen. This addition amplifies our manufacturing capability by providing redundancy and cost savings. The contracts augment our active and in-process fill and finish capacity.
 
There have been delays related to importing Ampligen to China. We are working with Smoore to alleviate these issues and to identify a mutually beneficial course of action that would allow us to move forward with the proposed testing of Ampligen. We will announce when the shipment for testing purposes has been completed. AIM and Smoore signed a two-year extension of their MTA in May 2021. We are exploring avenues to further test Ampligen as an inhalation therapy in the United States and Europe, while Smoore continues to work toward receiving authorization to import Ampligen to China.
 
We believe, and are investigating, Ampligen’s potential role in enhancing the activity of influenza vaccines. While certain studies involving rodents, non-human primates (monkeys) and healthy human subjects indicate that Ampligen may enhance the activity of influenza vaccines by conferring increased cross-reactivity or cross-protection, further studies will be required and no assurance can be given that Ampligen will assist in the development of a universal vaccine for influenza or other viruses.
 
Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise.
 
This Report also refers to estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other data about our industry. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the markets in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.

OUR PRODUCTS
 
Our primary pharmaceutical product platform consists of Ampligen (rintatolimod), a first-in-class drug of large macromolecular double-stranded (ds) RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules, and our FDA-approved natural alpha-interferon product, Alferon N Injection.
Ampligen®
 
Ampligen is approved for sale in Argentina (to 2026) for severe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”) and is an experimental drug in the United States currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of certain cancers and ME/CFS. Over its developmental history, Ampligen has received various designations, including Orphan Drug Product Designation (FDA and European Medicines Agency [“EMA”]), Treatment protocol (e.g., “Expanded Access” or “Compassionate” use authorization) with Cost Recovery Authorization (FDA) and “promising” clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports (“AHRQ” or Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). Based on the results of published, peer-reviewed pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that Ampligen may have broad-spectrum antiviral and anti-cancer properties.
 
We believe that nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of many human diseases. Ampligen represents the first drug in the class of large (macromolecular) dsRNA molecules to apply for NDA review. There are two forms of nucleic acids: deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) and ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). DNA is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes, the cell’s genetic machinery. RNA is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell’s behavior which, in turn, regulates the action of groups of cells, including the cells which comprise the body’s immune system. RNA directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors. Our drug technology utilizes specifically configured RNA and is a selective Toll-like Receptor 3 (“TLR3”) agonist that can be administered intravenously, intranasally and intraperitoneally. Ampligen has been assigned the generic name rintatolimod by the United States Adopted Names Council (“USANC”) and has the chemical designation poly(I):poly(C12U).

Expanded Access Program/Early Access Programs/clinical trials of Ampligen that have been conducted or that are ongoing include studies of the potential treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, ME/CFS, Hepatitis B, HIV, COVID-19 and Post-COVID conditions.
 
We have received approval of our NDA from ANMAT for the commercial sale of Ampligen in the Argentine Republic for the treatment of severe CFS. The product will be marketed by GP Pharm, our commercial partner in Latin America. Shipment of the drug product to Argentina was initiated in 2018 to complete the release testing by ANMAT needed for commercial distribution. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. In June 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. We are currently working with GP Pharm on the commercial launch of Ampligen in Argentina. Commercialization in Argentina will require, among other things, GP Pharm to establish disease awareness, medical education, creation of an appropriate reimbursement level, design of marketing strategies and completion of manufacturing preparations for launch and ANMAT conducting a final inspection of the product and release tests before granting final approval to begin commercial sales. AIM has supplied GP Pharm with the Ampligen required for testing and ANMAT release. This testing and approval process is currently delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ANMAT’s internal processes. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 in Argentina is taxing the nation’s health care system and is, understandably, the main priority of its regulators. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina. We continue to pursue our Ampligen NDA, for the treatment of CFS with the FDA.
 
The FDA has authorized an open-label expanded access treatment protocol (“AMP-511”) allowing patient access to Ampligen in a study under which severely debilitated CFS patients have the opportunity to be on Ampligen to treat this very serious and chronic condition. The AMP-511 protocol started in the 1990s and is ongoing. The data collected from the AMP-511 protocol through clinical sites provide safety information regarding the use of Ampligen in patients with CFS. We are establishing an enlarged database of clinical safety information which we believe will provide further documentation regarding the absence of autoimmune disease associated with Ampligen treatment. We believe that continued efforts to understand existing data, and to advance the development of new data and information, will ultimately support our future filings for Ampligen and/or the design of future clinical studies that the FDA requested in a CRL. The FDA approved an increased reimbursement level from $200 to $345 per 200 mg vial of Ampligen, due to increased production costs; which was re-authorized in 2021. At this time, we do not plan on passing this adjustment along to the patients in this program. As of December 31, 2021, there are 11 patients enrolled in this open-label expanded access treatment protocol (including 2 post-COVID-19 patients with cognitive dysfunction). In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms; four of the 11 patients enrolled have post-COVID chronic-fatigue-like symptoms. Early data from the ongoing AMP-511 Expanded Access Program has indicated that patients with cognitive function deficiency have reported improvements in cognitive function after Ampligen treatment.
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement with myTomorrows, a Netherlands based company, for the commencement and management of an Early Access Program (“EAP”) in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, myTomorrows also is managing all Early Access Programs and Special Access Programs in Europe, Canada and Turkey to treat pancreatic cancer and ME/CFS patients. The agreement was automatically extended for a period of 12 months on May 20, 2021, and will automatically extend for an additional period of 12 months on May 20, 2022.
 
In April 2018, we completed data analysis of an intranasal human safety study of Ampligen-plus-FluMist®, known as AMP-600. The study was previously closed after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) made a general recommendation against the use of FluMist® at that time. Intranasal Ampligen in combination with FluMist® was generally well-tolerated in the study.
 
In June 2018, Ampligen was cited as outperforming two other TLR3 agonists — poly IC and natural double stranded RNA — in creating an enhanced tumor microenvironment for checkpoint blockage therapy in the journal of Cancer Research (http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2018/05/31/0008-5472.CAN-17-3985). In a head-to-head study in explant culture models, Ampligen activated the TLR3 pathway and promoted an accumulation of killer T cells but, unlike the other two TLR3 agonists, it did so without causing regulatory T cell (Treg) attraction. These findings were considered important because they indicate that Ampligen selectively reprograms the tumor microenvironment by inducing the beneficial aspects of tumor inflammation (attracting killer T cells), without amplifying immune-suppressive elements such as regulatory T cells. The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and Roswell Park as a part of the NIH-funded P01 CA132714 and Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence (“SPORE”).
 
In 2018, we completed production of two commercial-size batches of more than 16,000 vials of Ampligen, following its “Fill & Finish” at Jubilant HollisterStier, the Contract Manufacturing Organization. These lots passed all required testing for regulatory release for human use and are being used for multiple programs, including the treatment of ME/CFS, the pancreatic cancer EAP in the Netherlands, and will continue to be used for ongoing and future clinical studies in oncology. Additionally, two lots of Ampligen were manufactured in December 2019 and January 2020 at Jubilant HollisterStier. The current manufactured lots of Ampligen have been fully tested and released for commercial product launch in Argentina and for clinical trials. Additionally, in December 2020, we added Pharmaceutics International Inc. (“Pii”) as a “Fill & Finish” provider to enhance our capacity to produce Ampligen. This addition amplifies our manufacturing capability by providing redundancy and cost savings. The contracts augment our active and in-process fill and finish capacity.

Alferon N Injection®
 
Alferon N Injection is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon. Alferon N Injection is the only natural-source, multi-species alpha interferon currently approved for sale in the United States and Argentina for the intralesional (within lesions) treatment of refractory (resistant to other treatment) or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Alferon N Injection is also approved in Argentina for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferons. Certain types of human papilloma viruses (“HPV”) cause genital warts, a sexually transmitted disease (“STD”). According to the CDC, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, with approximately 79 million Americans — most in their late teens and early 20s — infected with HPV. In fact, the CDC states that “HPV is so common that nearly all sexually active men and women get the virus at some point in their lives.” Although they do not usually result in death, genital warts commonly recur, causing significant morbidity and entail substantial health care costs.
 
Interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases. Researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon: alpha, beta, gamma and omega. Alferon N Injection contains a multi-species form of alpha interferon. The worldwide market for injectable alpha interferon-based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide. Alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways: by genetic engineering, by cell culture, and from human white blood cells. All three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the United States. Our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells. The potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant (i.e., synthetic) interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions. Natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon. In contrast, commercial recombinant alpha interferon products each contain only a single species. Researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus. Natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species, which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies. Natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated (i.e., partially covered with sugar molecules). Such glycosylation is not present on the currently U.S.-marketed recombinant alpha interferons. We believe that the absence of glycosylation may be in part responsible for the production of interferon-neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon. Although cell culture-derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species, the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon.
 
Alferon N Injection [Interferon alfa-n3 (human leukocyte derived)] is a highly purified, natural-source, glycosylated, multi-species alpha interferon product. There are essentially no neutralizing antibodies observed against Alferon N Injection to date and the product has a relatively low side-effect profile. The recombinant DNA derived alpha interferon formulations have been reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year of treatment, probably due to neutralizing antibody formation (See “Manufacturing” and “Marketing/Distribution” sections below for more details on the manufacture and marketing/distribution of Alferon N Injection).
 
PATENTS AND NON-PATENT EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 44 patents worldwide with 39 additional pending patent applications comprising our intellectual property. Please see “Note 5: Patents, Trademark Rights and Other Intangibles (FASB ASC 350 General Intangibles Other than Goodwill)” under Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these patents. We continually review our patents’ rights to determine whether they have continuing value.
 
In February 2020, we filed three provisional patent applications related to Ampligen in our efforts toward joining the global health community in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. These include: 1) Ampligen as a therapy and prophylaxis for COVID-19; 2) Ampligen as part of a proposed intranasal universal coronavirus vaccine; and 3) a high-volume manufacturing process for Ampligen.
 
In 2016, we received a new Ampligen composition of matter patent in the US (#9,315,538). In 2015, we were granted a new composition of matter patent (#2340307) by the European Patent Office and we received twenty-eight new patents in various EU countries. In 2014, we were granted a new composition of matter patent in the United States (#8722874) covering Ampligen formulations.

The Ampligen U.S. CFS treatment patent (#6130206) expired October 10, 2017 (we believe that the expiration of this patent will have minimal impact on us; see details on U.S. #9315538, U.S. #8722874 and the information from the FDA has granted “orphan drug status” to the drug for CFS below). Our U.S. Ampligen Trademark (#73617687) has been renewed through December 6, 2028. New therapeutic use patent applications are pending. On May 13, 2014, the United States Patent Office issued patent U.S. #8722874 titled “Double-Stranded Ribonucleic Acids with Rugged Physiochemical Structure and Highly Specific Biologic Activity,” with all rights assigned to us. The patent claims a novel form of rugged dsRNA. Rugged dsRNA are nucleic acids with a unique composition and physical characteristic identified with high specificity of binding to Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3), thereby conveying an important range of therapeutic opportunities. The newly discovered form of dsRNA has increased bioactivity and binding affinity to the TLR 3 receptor because of its reduced tendency to form branched dsRNA which can inhibit receptor binding. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the newly discovered nucleic acid as active ingredients and methods of treatment with those formulations are also described in the issued patent. We believe that the issuance of U.S. Patents #9315538 and #8722874 will help ensure that we retain patent protection for novel formulations of Ampligen products until at least 2029.
 
In September 2015, the European Patent Office granted the European version of U.S. Patent #9315538, with all rights assigned to us.
 
In addition to our patent rights relating to Ampligen, the FDA has granted “orphan drug status” to the drug for CFS, HIV/AIDS, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and malignant melanoma. Orphan drug status grants us protection against the potential subsequent approval of other sponsors’ versions of the drug for these uses for a period of seven years following FDA approval of Ampligen for each of these designated uses. The first NDA approval for Ampligen as a new chemical entity will also qualify for four or five years of non-patent exclusivity during which abbreviated new drug applications seeking approval to market generic versions of the drug cannot be submitted to the FDA. (See “Government Regulation” below.)
 
In May 2011, a new United States Patent #7943147 was granted for the use of Ampligen as a vaccine adjuvant for use with seasonal influenza vaccine to induce an enhanced immune response against H5N1 avian influenza.
 
In March 2021, we were granted a patent by the Netherlands Patent Office with granted patent claims that include, but are not limited to, the use of Ampligen as a combination cancer therapy with checkpoint blockade inhibitors (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab).
 
With respect to Alferon N Injection, the composition is a complex mixture of natural interferon species that is manufactured from human leukocytes obtained from human blood donors. In addition, while it is the current standard by the FDA to treat biological drug products like interferon as “Well Characterized” biologics, a process for which chemical entities can have their identity, purity, impurities, potency, and quality controlled by chemical testing, Alferon N Injection, as a natural interferon, does not lend itself well to such testing. Moreover, FDA continues to require that each lot of Alferon N Injection we produce be tested and released by the FDA before it can be distributed for commercial sales. Because of the complexity of the Alferon N Injection manufacturing process and these additional regulatory requirements, we believe that potential manufacturers of generic, or so-called “bio-similar,” drug products are focused on developing recombinant interferon products, rather than natural interferon products. For these reasons, we believe that not having patent protection should have no or little impact on us. Additionally, at the receipt of the FDA certification for the revised Alferon N Injection manufacturing process and techniques in New Brunswick, NJ, it is our intention to file for additional patent protection.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (“R&D”)
 
Our general focus during the past several fiscal years has been on the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of immune-based disorders including cancer and CFS. While we have previously estimated milestone dates when significant progress could be reported, the reality of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could mean the re-direction of resources away from ongoing clinical trials and toward the research and development of potential treatments for the coronavirus. In this regard, we have widened our focus to include research and development of potential prophylactic and therapeutic applications for the treatment of COVID-19, including the long-term effects of COVID-19.
 
Immuno-Oncology
 
The potential of Ampligen as an immuno-oncology therapeutic has been a major focus of AIM since our current leadership took over in 2016. We have been working with the University of Pittsburgh’s chemokine modulation research initiative, which includes the use of Ampligen as a potential adjuvant to modify the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) with the goal of increasing anti-tumor responses to check point inhibitors (“CPI”). As part of this collaboration, we have supplied Ampligen to the University. The study, under the leadership of Robert P. Edwards, MD, chair of gynecologic services at Magee-Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and Professor of Surgery Pawel Kalinski, M.D., Ph.D., at Roswell Park, Buffalo, N.Y., involved the chemokine modulatory regimen developed by Dr. Kalinski’s group and successfully completed the Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with resectable colorectal cancer. In the 1st quarter of 2017, Dr. Kalinski relocated to Roswell Park in Buffalo, NY and has established a cancer program which will continue to require a supply of Ampligen.

Multiple Ampligen clinical trials are underway or recently completed at major university cancer centers testing whether tumor microenvironments can be reprogrammed to increase the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors, The underway trials are:
 

● | Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer - A follow-up Phase 2 study of advanced recurrent ovarian cancer using cisplatin, pembrolizumab, plus Ampligen; up to 45 patients to be enrolled; enrollment has commenced, and numerous patients have commenced treatment. We recently announced interim data from the study, which demonstrated that evidence of increased biomarkers associated with T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function was seen when combining Ampligen, pembrolizumab and cisplatin. Increases of these biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment have been correlated with favorable tumor responses https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03734692 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Stage 4 Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Phase 1/2 study of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer using chemokine modulation therapy, including Ampligen and pembrolizumab. Eight patients were enrolled and treated. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03599453 
● | Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer Metastatic to the Liver - Phase 2a study of Ampligen as a component of chemokine modulatory regimen on colorectal cancer metastatic to liver; recruitment has been completed; 15 patients were enrolled and treated. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03403634 
● | Early-Stage Prostate Cancer - Phase 2 study investigating the effectiveness and safety of aspirin and Ampligen with or without interferon-alpha 2b (Intron A) compared to no drug treatments in a randomized three-arm study of patients with prostate cancer before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patient enrollment has been initiated in this study designed for up to 45 patients. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03899987 
● | Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Phase 1 study of chemokine modulation plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage triple negative breast cancer has received FDA authorization; the objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a combination of Ampligen, celecoxib with or without Intron A, when given along with chemotherapy; the goal of this approach is to increase survival. This study is recruiting patients designed for up to 24 patients. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04081389 

 
The below Ampligen clinical trials and related activities are planned for initiation in 2022:
 

● | Phase 2 Pancreatic Cancer Trial - In October 2021, AIM and Amarex submitted an IND application with the FDA for a planned Phase 2 study of Ampligen as a therapy for locally advanced or metastatic late-stage pancreatic cancer. The FDA placed the study on Clinical Hold in November 2021 and provided valuable feedback on the study design. We submitted our response to the Clinical Hold in February 2022. In March 2022, we received notification from the FDA that the Clinical Hold was released and cleared, meaning that we are now able to proceed with the study. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Ovarian Cancer - A Phase 2 Cisplatin-Resistant Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study utilizing Ampligen is planned at the University of Pittsburgh. 
● | Refractory Melanoma — Phase 2 study that will evaluate polarized dendritic cell vaccine, interferon alpha-2, Ampligen and celecoxib for the treatment of HLA-A2+ refractory melanoma at Roswell Park. Up to 24 patients to be enrolled (See: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04093323). 

 
As part of this business and scientific strategy, and after lengthy discussions with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, we have determined that it is not in our stockholders’ best interests to relinquish “Third-Party Beneficiary” rights to any of our pre-existing intellectual property without appropriate compensation and licensing terms. This business decision has created an impasse which means we will not be moving forward with certain planned trials at Roswell Park. These trials are:
 

● | A colorectal carcinoma trial; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A proposed brain metastatic triple-negative breast cancer trial; 
● | A proposed non-small cell lung cancer trial; and 
● | A urothelial, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma trial. 

 
Furthermore, unlike pancreatic cancer and advanced recurrent ovarian cancer, these previous planned studies are not on our near-term critical path for future NDAs. Therefore, these will only become a priority after we accomplish our near-term goals related to pancreatic cancer and advanced recurrent ovarian cancer where data supports priority status.

Advanced Ovarian Cancer
 
Results of the Phase 1 portion of a Phase 1/2 study of intraperitoneal chemo- immunotherapy in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer were published in the American Association for Cancer Research publication, Clinical Cancer Research (Clin Cancer Res January 19 2022 DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-3659). The study results represent an important extension of prior studies using human tumor explants that showed Ampligen’s potentially important role as a TLR3 agonist acting synergistically with high-dose IFNα and celecoxib to selectively enhance Teff cell-attractants while suppressing Treg-attractants in the tumor microenvironment with a concomitant increase in the Teff/Treg ratio. The importance of boosting the Teff/Treg ratio in the tumor microenvironment is that it is associated with the conversion of ‘cold’ tumors into ‘hot’ tumors, which have an increased sensitivity to chemo-immunotherapy and an improved chance of showing tumor regression. The Phase 1 portion was designed to establish intraperitoneal safety. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02432378
 
In March 2021, we were granted a patent by the Netherlands Patent Office with granted patent claims that include, but are not limited to, the use of Ampligen as a combination cancer therapy with checkpoint blockade inhibitors (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab). Interim data from an investigator-initiated, Phase 2, single-arm, efficacy/safety trial demonstrated that evidence of increased biomarkers associated with T cell chemotaxis and cytolytic function was seen when combining Ampligen, pembrolizumab and cisplatin. It is critical to note that increases of these biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment have been correlated with favorable tumor responses. All told, the study has seen a Clinical Benefit Rate of 61.6%; a study of pembrolizumab alone in the treatment of advanced recurrent ovarian cancer found Objective Response Rates of 7.4% and 9.9% across two cohorts.
 
The positive data makes this patent have heightened potential. Similar patents are pending in other counties.
 
Pancreatic Cancer
 
In January 2017, the EAP established under our agreement with myTomorrows to enable access of Ampligen to ME/CFS patients was extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in Europe and Turkey and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program. In February 2018, the agreement with myTomorrows was extended to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval. There have been no physician requests to date that would cause the program to move forward with the approval process.
 
A total of 42 pancreatic cancer patients received treatment with Ampligen immuno-oncology therapy under the EAP program at Erasmus MC in the Netherlands. Supervised by Prof. Casper van Eijck, MD, the team at Erasmus MC in September 2020 reported data which demonstrated a statistically significant positive survival benefit when using Ampligen in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer after systemic chemotherapy, compared with historical control patients. We are working with our Contract Research Organization, Amarex Clinical Research LLC, to seek FDA “fast-track” and to obtain IND authorizations to conduct follow-up pancreatic cancer Phase 2 clinical trials with potential sites in the Netherlands at Erasmus MC under Prof. van Eijck, and also at major cancer research centers in the United States such as The Buffett Cancer Center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). Additionally:
 

● | In December 2020, the FDA granted Ampligen Orphan Drug Designation status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States or meets cost recovery provisions of the act. The status helps incentivize the treatment of therapies to treat unmet medical needs by providing a company with seven years of exclusivity rights once a drug reaches market. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In February 2021, our subsidiary, NV Hemispherx Biopharma Europe, received formal notification from the European Commission (“EC”) granting Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for Ampligen as a treatment for pancreatic cancer. Orphan products, once commercially approved in the European Union (“EU”), receive benefits including up to ten years of protection from market competition from similar medicines with similar active component and indication for use that are not shown to be clinically superior. 

 
In June 2021, Ampligen was featured in a publication containing state-of-the-art methodologies in the peer-reviewed medical journal Cancers as a potential treatment option for cancer patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study’s authors stated that Ampligen has the potential to reduce the severity of the deadly respiratory disease COVID-19. According to laboratory data presented in the publication, “Rintatolimod [Ampligen] activated the innate and the adaptive immune systems by activating a cascade of actions in human pancreatic cancer cells”, including:
 

● | Stimulation of interferon regulatory factors and activation of the interferon signaling pathway, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Production of immunomodulatory activity and 
● | Induction of the expression of MHC class I and II histocompatibility 

 
The full journal article is titled: “Rintatolimod Induces Antiviral Activities in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells: Opening for an Anti-COVID-19 Opportunity in Cancer Patients?” Cancers is a peer-reviewed, open access journal of oncology published semimonthly online by MDPI. The study’s authors include Prof. C.H.J. van Eijck, MD, PhD, the lead investigator for an EAP at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands.
 
In October 2021, we and Amarex submitted an IND application with the FDA for a planned Phase 2 study of Ampligen as a therapy for locally advanced or metastatic late-stage pancreatic cancer. In December 2021, the FDA responded with a Clinical Hold on the proposed study. We submitted our response to the FDA in February 2022.
 
In March 2022, we received notification from the FDA that the Clinical Hold was released and cleared, meaning that we are now able to proceed with the study. The AMP-270 clinical trial is planned to be a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel-arm study with the primary objective of comparing the efficacy of Ampligen versus a no treatment control group following FOLFIRINOX for subjects with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Secondary objectives include comparing safety and tolerability. We plan to enroll approximately 90 subjects across up to 30 centers in the U.S. and Europe. The Buffett Cancer Center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and Erasmus MC in The Netherlands are expected to be the primary study sites. Amarex Clinical Research will manage the AIM-sponsored Phase 2 study.

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”)
 
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”), also known as Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (“CFIDS”) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”), is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem. ME/CFS is recognized by both the government and private sector as a significant unmet medical need, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), FDA and the CDC. The CDC states on its website at https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/ that “Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with ME/CFS are often not able to do their usual activities. At times, ME/CFS may confine them to bed. People with ME/CFS have severe fatigue and sleep problems. ME/CFS may get worse after people with the illness try to do as much as they want or need to do. This symptom is known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). Other symptoms can include problems with thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness.”
 
Many severe ME/CFS patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest. ME/CFS is characterized by incapacitating fatigue with profound exhaustion and extremely poor stamina, sleep difficulties and problems with concentration and short-term memory. It is also accompanied by flu-like symptoms, pain in the joints and muscles, tender lymph nodes, sore throat and new headaches. A distinctive characteristic of the illness is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion, which do not subside with rest.
 
The high number of younger people being hospitalized for COVID-19 suggests considerable numbers of people in the prime of their lives may have a COVID-induced ME/CFS-like illness in their future. According to a 2016 journal article, the estimated annual cost of lost productivity related to ME/CFS was $9-37 billion in the United States, and for direct medical costs it was $9-14 billion.
 
In June of 2020, we filed a provisional patent application for, among other discoveries, the use of Ampligen as a potential early-onset therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 induced chronic fatigue.
 
Many survivors of the first SARS-CoV-1 epidemic in 2003 continued to report chronic fatigue, difficulty sleeping and shortness of breath months after recovering from the acute illness. “After one year, 17% of patients had not returned to work and 9% more had not returned to their pre-SARS work levels,” according to Simmaron Research. Now there is increasing evidence that patients with COVID-19 can develop a similar, ME/CFS-like illness. These patients are commonly referred to as “Long Haulers.”
 
In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 following clearance of the virus, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms. For more information on our AMP-511 Expanded Access Program, please see “OUR PRODUCTS: Ampligen” above.
 
In November 2020, we announced the publication of statistically significant data detailing how Ampligen could have a considerable positive impact on people living with ME/CFS when administered in the early stages of the disease. The data were published in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by the Public Library of Science. AIM researchers found that the TLR3 agonist Ampligen substantially improved physical performance in a subset of ME/CFS patients.
 
Ampligen as a Potential Antiviral
 
Following the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2002-03, Ampligen exhibited excellent antiviral properties and protective survival effect in NIH-contracted studies of SARS-CoV-1-infected mice, which is very similar to SARS-CoV-2, the novel virus that causes COVID-19.
 

● | The Barnard 2006 study (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095632020601700505) found that Ampligen reduced virus lung levels to below detectable limits. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Day 2009 study (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209005832 found that, instead of 100% mortality, there was 100% protective survival using Ampligen. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We compared key transcription regulatory sequences of SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 and found significant similarities, suggesting highly probable extension of the antiviral effects of Ampligen in the earlier NIH-contracted SARS experiments to COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus – which causes COVID-19 – shares important genomic and pathogenic similarities with SARS-CoV-1 (hence its name). Since Ampligen has shown antiviral activity against more distantly related coronaviruses, there was a reasonable probability that the antiviral effects of Ampligen against SARS-CoV-1 will likely extend to SARS-CoV-2, and as discussed below, recently, Ampligen has demonstrated ex vivo antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. We believe that this creates a compelling case for clinical trials to evaluate Ampligen as a potential tool in the fight against COVID-19.
 
Since the late 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, we have been actively engaged in determining whether Ampligen could be an effective treatment for this virus or could be part of a vaccine. We believe that Ampligen has the potential to be both an early-onset treatment for and prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. We believe that prior studies of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-1 animal experimentation may predict similar protective effects against the new virus.

In February 2020, we filed three provisional patent applications related to Ampligen in our efforts toward joining the global health community in the fight against the deadly coronavirus (See: https://aimimmuno.com/press-release/aim-immunotech-files-provisional-patent-application-for-the-use-of-ampligenr-as-a-potential-therapy-for-covid-19-induced-chronic- fatigue/). Our three provisional patent applications include: 1) Ampligen as a therapy for the coronavirus; 2) Ampligen as part of a proposed intranasal universal coronavirus vaccine that combines Ampligen with inactivated coronavirus, conveying immunity and cross-protection and; 3) a high-volume manufacturing process for Ampligen. Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970, which provides international protections for patents, these three provisional patent applications were converted in to two international patent applications based on the date of their filings.
 
In April 2020, we entered into a Material Transfer and Research Agreement (“MTA”) with Shenzhen Smoore Technology to study the utilization of an innovative Smoore inhalation delivery device and Ampligen as a potential treatment approach for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The MTA was extended for two years in May 2021. There have been obstacles related to importing Ampligen to China. We have been working with Smoore to alleviate these issues and to identify a mutually beneficial course of action that would allow us to move forward with the proposed testing of Ampligen outside of China. On parallel paths, over the past year, Smoore focused on the development of a personal inhalation device designed to administer Ampligen, given temperature parameters of dsRNA. Contemporaneously, we have studied the safety and efficacy of Ampligen using an ex vivo 3D model in primary human respiratory epithelial cells at Utah State University, which showed that Ampligen was able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral yields by 90% at clinically achievable intranasal Ampligen dosage levels, and conducted intranasal safety testing. AIM and Smoore signed a two-year extension of the MTA in May 2021. We are exploring avenues to further test Ampligen as an inhalation therapy in the United States and Europe, while Smoore continues to work toward receiving authorization to import Ampligen to China. However, progress in this area is stymied, and due to an inability to import the drug we are considering our options.
 
In August 2020, we contracted Amarex Clinical Research LLC (“Amarex”) to act as our Clinical Research Organization and provide regulatory support with regard to a possible clinical trial testing Ampligen’s potential as a COVID-19 prophylaxis via intranasal delivery.
 
Beginning in April 2020, we entered into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with numerous companies for the potential outsourcing of the production of polymer, enzyme, placebo as well as Ampligen, and one Contract Research Organization, Amarex, which will provide regulatory and monitoring support related to a clinical trial testing Ampligen’s intranasal safety and potential as a COVID-19 prophylaxis via intranasal delivery.
 
In addition, in February 2020 we joined with ChinaGoAbroad (“CGA”) to facilitate the entry of Ampligen into the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) for use as a prophylactic/early-onset therapeutic against COVID-19. CGA is a member-based online information platform and offline advisory firm serving to facilitate two-way international transactions relating to the PRC in collaboration with the China Overseas Development Association (“CODA”). While this relationship is currently inactive, we remain open to utilizing ChinaGoAbroad if and when an opportunity arises.
 
In May 2020, the FDA authorized an IND for Roswell Park to conduct a Phase 1/2a study of a regimen of Ampligen and interferon alpha in cancer patients with COVID-19 infections. This clinical trial, sponsored by Roswell Park in collaboration with us, will test the safety of this combination regimen in patients with cancer and COVID-19, and the extent to which this therapy will promote clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the upper airway. Several subjects have been treated and recruitment continues. It is planned that the phase 1/2a study will enroll up to 44 patients in two stages. Phase 1 will see 12-24 patients receiving both Ampligen and interferon alpha-2b at escalating doses. Once that initial phase is complete, further study participants will be randomized to two arms: one receiving the two-drug combination and a control group who will not receive Ampligen or interferon alpha but will receive best available care. We are a financial sponsor of the study and will provide Ampligen at no charge for this study.
 
In July 2020, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with Roswell Park pursuant to which Roswell Park will conduct a Phase 1/2a trial of Ampligen (rintatolimod) in combination with interferon alpha, in cancer patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We and the National Cancer Institute are supporting this trial. We reported in September 2020 that recruitment in the trial had begun (See clinicaltrials.gov/NCT04379518). In November 2020, the first patient in the study had been enrolled and treated. This study was amended to add 20 patients, with 10 randomized to receive a single dose of Ampligen and 10 patients to receive current best therapies.
 
We also entered into a specialized services agreement with Utah State University and have supplied Ampligen to support the University’s Institute for Viral Research in its research into SARS-CoV-2. The Utah State results show that Ampligen was able to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral yields by 90% at clinically achievable intranasal Ampligen dosage levels.
 
In October 2020, we received IRB approval for the expansion of the AMP-511 Expanded Access Program clinical trial for ME/CFS to include patients previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, but who still demonstrate chronic fatigue-like symptoms. Patients in the trial are treated with our flagship pipeline drug Ampligen. In January 2021, we commenced with the treatment of the first previously diagnosed COVID-19 patient with long-COVID symptoms (i.e., Long Hauler) in the AMP-511 study. Enrollment of Long Hauler patients continues in the study.

In November 2020, we entered into a Material Transfer and Research Agreement with Leyden Laboratories, B.V., (“Leyden Lab”) to facilitate two proposed studies/research projects:
 

● | An assessment of protective potential of intranasal administration of Ampligen in SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster challenge model; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An assessment of protective potential of intranasal Ampligen in lethal influenza mouse challenge model. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In January 2021, we entered into a Sponsor Agreement with the Centre for Human Drug Research (“CHDR”), a foundation located in the Leiden in the Netherlands, to manage a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and activity of repeated intranasal administration of Ampligen. AIM funded and sponsored the study. This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and biological activity of repeated administration of Ampligen intranasally. A total of 40 healthy subjects received either Ampligen or a placebo in the trial, with the Ampligen given at four escalating dosages across four cohorts, to a maximum level of 1,250 micrograms. All patients had completed treatment by June 2021 and the interim results reported no Serious or Severe Adverse Events at any dosage level. We believe that the trial is a critical step in our ongoing efforts to develop Ampligen as a potential prophylaxis or treatment for COVID-19 and other respiratory viral diseases. Amarex provided us with monitoring support during the trial.
 
Following the completion of the Phase 1 dosing, and based on its positive interim results in June 2021 (which have since been publicly supported in a CHDR-created data visualization published in October 2021), we signed a Reservation and Start-Up Agreement with hVIVO, reserving space in hVIVO’s quarantine facility to sponsor a Phase 2a Human Challenge Trial (“HCT”) to test Ampligen as a potential intranasal antiviral therapy using a human Rhinovirus hRV (common cold virus) and Influenza. This antiviral study was to be conducted by hVIVO, a subsidiary of Open Orphan plc. We submitted a study protocol to the Oxford Research Ethics Committee (“REC”)/Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) in September 2021. The REC approved the protocol, but the MHRA provided a response outlining areas of the submission where it requires additional information. A response was submitted to MHRA in October 2021. The REC provided a “favorable opinion” to proceed, but the MHRA issued a Non-Acceptance response in November 2021. A full revised application was resubmitted in December 2021. The MHRA issued Grounds for Non-Acceptance and requested additional data before moving forward. As the request would require us to first conduct an animal experiment that we believe would take approximately six months to complete, we determined that continuing with the HCT application process would not be a prudent use of our resources, so we terminated our agreement with hVIVO and officially notified the MHRA of our decision to withdraw our application. As the MHRA’s Grounds for Non-Acceptance had already been issued, our withdrawal was technically recognized as a rejection of the proposed study.
 
Additionally, we filed two COVID-19-related provisional patent applications in the third quarter of 2021. In August, we filed an application for Ampligen as both an intranasal and an intravenous therapy for what we describe as Post-COVID conditions. The people suffering from Post-COVID conditions, including some young adults, can be afflicted with severe difficulties in concentrating; serious memory problems; and the inability to live an active lifestyle, to work and even to perform everyday tasks. Early data has demonstrated that patients with symptoms of Post-COVID conditions being treated with Ampligen in the ongoing AMP-511 Expanded Access Program have reported improvements in cognitive function. Similarly, in ME/CFS, data supports the claim that Ampligen improves cognitive function. Then in September, we filed a patent application for Ampligen as a potential early-onset intranasal therapy designed to enhance and expand infection-induced immunity, epitope spreading, cross-reactivity and cross-protection in patients exposed to a wide range of RNA respiratory viruses, such as influenza, Rhinoviruses and SARS-CoV-2.
 
In addition to securing these two provisional patent applications, we also moved forward with proposed studies in these areas and with Pre-Investigational New Drug Applications in September. One pre-IND was for a Phase 2, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ampligen in patients experiencing Post-COVID conditions. Eighty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive twice weekly infusions of Ampligen or placebo for a period of 12 weeks. Amarex Clinical Research, an NSF International company, is managing the FDA submission and will manage the clinical trial. The pre-IND meeting request was transferred to the FDA’s Division of Neurology by the FDA’s Covid Scientific Technical Triage Team. In November, the FDA responded that there was insufficient information to support the proposed indication of post-COVID cognitive dysfunction. We are working with Amarex to revise the study and resubmit it to the FDA.

In September 2021, we submitted another pre-IND meeting request for two separate Phase 2 clinical studies to study the potential of Ampligen as both an infusion and an intranasal therapy for early-onset COVID-19. The two clinical trials would be Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ampligen as an:
 

● | Intravenous therapy – 200 mg of Ampligen or placebo, with five doses over a treatment period of 17 days; and an 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Intranasal therapy – 1,250 μg spray (625 μg per nostril), with seven doses over a treatment period of 15 days. 

 
The FDA responded that it was premature and denied our meeting request, noting the primary reason that we first needed to address its comments on two prior similar pre-IND submissions related to the potential risks of administering Ampligen to patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 were justified by potential benefits. We plan to respond to the FDA regarding the early onset COVID-19 submission. The FDA has already authorized Ampligen for a clinical trial in cancer patients, and subjects have been and will be treated in the investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our plans to study Ampligen in asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 cases await further consideration of the different risks and benefits associated with those trials.
 
Other Diseases
 
In Europe, the EMA has approved the Orphan Medicinal Products Designation for Ampligen as a potential treatment of Ebola virus disease and for Alferon N Injection as a potential treatment of MERS.
 
We concluded our series of collaborations designed to determine the potential effectiveness of Ampligen and Alferon N Injection as potential preventive and/or therapeutic treatments for Ebola-related disorders. Although we believe that the threat of both MERS and Ebola globally may reemerge in the future, it appears that the spread of these disorders has diminished. As a result, we have elected to focus our research and development efforts on other areas at this time.
 
In April 2021, we entered into an MTA with the University of Cagliari Dipartimento di Scienze della Vita e dell’Ambiente (“UNICA”), an educational institution, under the laws of Italy, located in Monserrato (Cagliari), Italy. The MTA relates to the research and development of the effects of Ampligen and its ability to induce interferon production in several cell lines, and also on the ability of the Ebola virus protein VP35 to bind to viral dsRNA and impede interferon’s upregulation and activity, and on Ampligen’s ability to reverse VP35 inhibition of interferon production in biological systems. The research is active and ongoing.
 
In May 2021, we filed a U.S. Provisional Patent Application for Ampligen as a potential therapeutic to possibly slow, halt, or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
The Administracion Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Tecnologia Medica (“ANMAT”) in Argentina approved Ampligen for commercial distribution for the treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“CFS”) in 2016. Shipment of the drug product to Argentina was initiated in 2018 to complete the release testing by ANMAT needed for commercial distribution. In September 2019, we received clearance from the FDA to ship Ampligen to Argentina for the commercial launch and subsequent sales. OI June 2020, we received import clearance from ANMAT to import the first shipment of commercial grade vials of Ampligen into Argentina. We are currently working with GP Pharm on the commercial launch of Ampligen in Argentina (See “Our Products; Ampligen” above).
 
Following our approval in Argentina, in 2017 we engaged Jubilant HollisterStier (“Jubilant”) to be our authorized CMO for Ampligen. Two lots of Ampligen consisting of more than 16,000 units were manufactured and released in 2018; these lots have been designated for human use in the United States in the cost recovery CFS program and for expanded oncology clinical trials. The production of additional polymer (Ampligen intermediates) took place in 2019 at our New Brunswick facility. Additionally, Jubilant manufactured two more lots of Ampligen in December 2019 and January 2020. The current manufactured lots of Ampligen have been fully tested and released for commercial product launch in Argentina and for clinical trials. In addition, we have supplied GP Pharm with the Ampligen required for testing and ANMAT release. Once final approval by ANMAT is obtained, we anticipate that GP Pharm will begin distributing Ampligen in Argentina.
 
In December 2020, we added Pharmaceutics International Inc. (“Pii”) as a “Fill & Finish” provider to enhance our capacity to produce Ampligen. This addition amplifies our manufacturing capability by providing redundancy and cost savings. The contracts augment our existing fill and finish capacity. We are prepared to initiate the production of additional Ampligen when and if needed.
 
In May 2021, we exercised our option to re-purchase the New Brunswick manufacturing facility, pursuant to the terms of the March 2018 sale and lease-back agreement. We thereafter sold certain equipment and machinery that we determined to be obsolete and no longer needed for current or future manufacturing. Then, on March 3, 2022, we entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with Acellories, Inc. as purchaser pursuant to which we will sell our property for $3.9 million. Among other things, the purchaser has a 45-day right of due diligence and has the right to terminate the agreement within that period.

Moving forward, we will require one or more Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMO”) to produce Ampligen API. While we believe we have sufficient Ampligen API to meet our current needs, we are also continually exploring new efficiencies so as to maximize our ability to fulfill future obligations. In this regard, in April 2021, we approved a proposal from Polysciences Inc. (“Polysciences”) for the manufacture of our Poly I and Poly C12U polynucleotides and associated test methods at Polysciences’ Warrington, PA location to enhance our capacity to produce the polymer precursors to the drug Ampligen. We are utilizing Polysciences’s expertise to refine our approach to polymer production. Additionally, we continue to be open to the possibility of agreements with other CMOs, so as to create redundancy and to meet the potential need for larger quantities of API.
 
Our second product, Alferon N Injection, is approved by the FDA for commercial sales in the United States for the treatment of genital warts. It is also approved by ANMAT in Argentina for commercial sales for the treatment of genital warts and in patients who are refractory to treatment with recombinant interferons. Commercial sales of Alferon N Injection in the United States will not resume until new batches of commercial filled and finished product are produced and released by the FDA. While our New Brunswick facility has FDA approval under the Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Alferon N Injection, and we intend to maintain a certain amount of space at the to-be-sold facility, we will need the FDA’s approval to release commercial product once we have identified our new manufacturing approach and submitted satisfactory stability and quality release data; the FDA has conducted any required inspections; and the FDA has approved our new manufacturing process. Currently, we are not manufacturing Alferon N Injection and there is no definitive timetable to resume production.
 
Licensing/Collaborations/Joint Ventures
 
To enable potential availability of Ampligen to patients on a worldwide basis, we have embarked on a strategy to license the product and/or to collaborate and/or create a joint venture with companies that have the demonstrated capabilities and commitment to successfully gain approval and commercialize Ampligen in their respective global territories of the world. Ideal partners would have the following characteristics: well-established global and regional experience and coverage; robust commercial infrastructure; a strong track record of successful development and registration of in-licensed products; and a therapeutic area fit (ME/CFS, immuno-oncology, e.g.).
 
MARKETING/DISTRIBUTION
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year exclusive Renewed Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Supply Agreement (the “Agreement”) with GP Pharm. Under this Agreement, GP Pharm was responsible for gaining regulatory approval in Argentina for Ampligen to treat severe CFS in Argentina and for commercializing Ampligen for this indication in Argentina. We granted GP Pharm the right to expand rights to sell this experimental therapeutic into other Latin America countries based upon GP Pharm achieving certain performance milestones. We also granted GP Pharm an option to market Alferon N Injection in Argentina and other Latin America countries (See “Our Products; Ampligen” above). The GP Pharm contract was extended in May 2021, and will now end on May 24, 2024.
 
In May 2016, we entered into a five-year agreement (the “Impatients Agreement”) with Impatients, N.V. (“myTomorrows”), a Netherlands-based company, for the commencement and management of an EAP in Europe and Turkey (the “Territory”) related to ME/CFS. Pursuant to the agreement, myTomorrows, as our exclusive service provider and distributor in the Territory, is performing EAP activities. These activities will be directed to (a) the education of physicians and patients regarding the possibility of early access to innovative medical treatments not yet the subject of a Marketing Authorization (regulatory approval) through named-patient use, compassionate use, expanded access and hospital exemption, (b) patient and physician outreach related to a patient-physician platform, (c) the securing of Early Access Approvals (exemptions and/or waivers required by regulatory authorities for medical treatments prior to Marketing Authorization) for the use of such treatments, (d) the distribution and sale of such treatments pursuant to such Early Access Approvals, (e) pharmacovigilance (drug safety) activities and/or (f) the collection of data such as patient-reported outcomes, doctor-reported experiences and registry data. We are supporting these efforts and supplying Ampligen to myTomorrows at a predetermined transfer price. In the event that we receive Marketing Authorization in any country in the Territory, we will pay myTomorrows a royalty on products sold. Pursuant to the Impatients Agreement, the royalty would be a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the Impatients Agreement) of Ampligen sold in the Territory where Marketing Authorization was obtained. The formula to determine the percentage of Net Sales will be based on the number of patients that are entered into the EAP. We believe that disclosure of the exact maximum royalty rate and royalty termination date could cause competitive harm. However, to assist the public in gauging these terms, the actual maximum royalty rate is somewhere between 2% and 10% and the royalty termination date is somewhere between five and fifteen years from the First Commercial Sale of a product within a specific country. The parties established a Joint Steering Committee comprised of representatives of both parties to oversee the EAP. No assurance can be given that activities under the EAP will result in Marketing Authorization or the sale of substantial amounts of Ampligen in the Territory. The agreement was automatically extended for a period of 12 months on May 20, 2021.

In January 2017, the ANMAT granted a five-year extension to a previous approval to sell and distribute Alferon N Injection (under the brand name “Naturaferon”) in Argentina. This extends the approval until 2022. A request to extend the approval beyond 2022 has been filed and is under review. In February 2013, we received the ANMAT approval for the treatment of refractory patients that failed or were intolerant to treatment with recombinant interferon, with Naturaferon in Argentina.
 
In January 2017, the EAP through our agreement with myTomorrows designed to enable access of Ampligen to ME/CFS patients was extended to pancreatic cancer patients beginning in the Netherlands. myTomorrows is our exclusive service provider in the Territory and will manage all EAP activities relating to the pancreatic cancer extension of the program.
 
In August 2017, we extended our agreement with Asembia LLC, formerly Armada Healthcare, LLC, to undertake the marketing, education and sales of Alferon N Injection throughout the United States. This agreement has expired and we are currently in discussions with Asembia exploring the continuation and expansion of this relationship.
 
In February 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows. This amendment extended the territory to cover Canada to treat pancreatic cancer patients, pending government approval. In March 2018, we signed an amendment to the EAP with myTomorrows, pursuant to which myTomorrows will be our exclusive service provider for special access activities in Canada for the supply of Ampligen for the treatment of ME/CFS.
 
In December 2020, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to 16 pancreatic cancer patients. In November 2021, we entered into a signed Letter of Agreement with myTomorrows for the delivery of Ampligen for the treatment of up to an additional 5 pancreatic cancer patients.
 
COMPETITION
 
The major pharmaceutical competitors for Ampligen include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., Novartis and AstraZeneca. Biotech competitors include Baxter International, Fletcher/CSI, AVANT Immunotherapeutics, AVI BioPharma and Genta. When we recommence sales of Alferon N Injection, it may compete with Intron® A, an injectable from Merck & Co.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of Alferon N Injection products and our ongoing research and product development activities. Ampligen and other products developed from the ongoing research and product development activities will require regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. In particular, new drug products for humans are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing as a condition for clearance by the FDA and by similar authorities in foreign countries. The process of seeking these approvals, and the ongoing process of compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, has and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue. We have received Orphan Drug designation for certain therapeutic indications, which we believe might under certain conditions help to accelerate the process of drug development and commercialization. Alferon N Injection is only approved for use in intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. Use of Alferon N Injection for other applications requires regulatory approval.
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work.
 
For more information about the current status of Alferon N Injection and Ampligen, please see “Our Products” above.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had personnel consisting of 21 full-time employees and two part-time employees. Five of the combined personnel are engaged in our research, development, clinical, and manufacturing effort with 18 performing regulatory, general administration, data processing, including bio-statistics, financial and investor relations functions. We have no union employees.
 
While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future.
