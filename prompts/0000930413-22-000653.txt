Fiscal Year



All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX’s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, “fiscal year 2021” means the period February 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.
Corporate History and Background



REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931.



In 2006, we started investing in ethanol production facilities. We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities – One Earth Energy, LLC (“One Earth”), NuGen Energy, LLC (“NuGen”), and Big River Resources, LLC (“Big River”). We own a majority interest in One Earth and NuGen. We also own a majority interest in an entity that owned and, until November 18, 2021, operated a refined coal facility. As we have ceased operating the refined coal facility, we began classifying the financial results of the operating segment as discontinued operations. We now have one reportable segment, ethanol and by-products.

General Overview



We reported net income attributable to REX common shareholders of $52.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2020. Our ethanol business bounced back strongly in fiscal 2021 particularly in the fourth quarter in comparison to fiscal 2020, which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two largest drivers of ethanol profitability are corn and ethanol pricing, both of which experienced significant volatility within the year. Chicago Board of Trade corn prices per bushel ranged from a low of $5.10 in September 2021 to a high of $7.40 in April 2021. S&P Global Platts ethanol pricing per gallon ranged from a low of $1.64 in February 2021 to a high of $3.80 in November 2021.



The form and structure of our ethanol investments are tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we partner. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants. We provide management oversight and direction with respect to most aspects of plant operations for our consolidated ethanol companies. We have equity investments in three entities engaged in the production of ethanol as of January 31, 2022. The following table is a summary of our ethanol entity ownership interests at January 31, 2022:




Entity | REX’s Current Ownership Interest 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
One Earth Energy, LLC | 75.8% 
NuGen Energy, LLC | 99.7% 
Big River Resources, LLC: Big River Resources W Burlington, LLC Big River Resources Galva, LLC Big River United Energy, LLC Big River Resources Boyceville, LLC | 10.3% 10.3% 5.7% 10.3% 




The three entities own a total of six ethanol production facilities, which in aggregate shipped approximately 699 millions gallons of ethanol over the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2022. REX’s effective ownership of gallons shipped, for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2022, by the ethanol production facilities in which we have ownership interests was approximately 282 million gallons.



Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon several factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market prices of ethanol and distillers grains are not always directly related to corn prices, at times ethanol and/or distillers grains prices may lag movements in corn prices. In an environment of higher corn prices or lower ethanol/distillers grains prices, the overall margin structure at the plants could be reduced. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or minimally positive operating margins.



We expect our ethanol plants to produce at least 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the actual gallons of denatured ethanol produced per bushel of grain processed as the realized yield. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by the realized yield) as the “crush spread.” Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants.

We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of commodity prices by utilizing forward grain purchase, forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts, and commodity futures and swap agreements, as management deems appropriate. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts generally lags the spot market with respect to ethanol prices. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than four months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in our realized crush spread for more than four months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future and swap contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities and commodity marketing activities.



On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, for approximately $12.0 million, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owned a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. As the plant was no longer eligible to receive federal production tax credits beginning on November 18, 2021, we ceased operations on that date. We began classifying this operation as discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.



During fiscal year 2013, we entered into a joint venture to file and defend patents for eSteam technology. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have not successfully had a field operation nor demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and our partner owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company. We have no current plans to operate this technology and are maintaining patents in limited countries.



We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, carbon sequestration, agricultural and other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.



Ethanol Industry



Ethanol is a renewable fuel produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in the fermentation process that is used in producing alcohol. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the facilities. An adequate supply of natural gas is key to maintaining optimal operating levels.



According to the Renewable Fuels Association (“RFA”), the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 15.0 billion gallons of ethanol in 2021. Although this is an increase of 1.2 billion gallons over the COVID-19 impacted 2020 volume, it is still below the estimated 15.8 billion gallons produced in 2019. Approximately 1.2 billion gallons were exported from the United States in 2021. According to the RFA, the United States ethanol industry consists of 208 plants in 25 states with an annual capacity of approximately 17.7 billion gallons of ethanol production.

Domestic demand for ethanol is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulations. On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “Energy Act of 2007”) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. The federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under Renewable Fuel Standard II (“RFS II”), established in October 2010. Corn-based ethanol is considered a conventional biofuel. There were mandated volumes established as part of the RFS II for conventional and advanced biofuels through the year 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture. The mandated volumes for conventional biofuel were to reach 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 and maintain that level until 2022.



The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions are met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region, or the United States. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, the EPA took action to reduce the volumes for both conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. The U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit ruled on July 28, 2017 against the EPA related to its decision to lower the 2016 volume requirements. As a result, the Court vacated the EPA’s decision to reduce the total renewable fuel volume requirements by 500 million gallons for 2016 through its waiver authority.



Under RFS II, a small refiner that processes less than 75,000 barrels of oil per day can petition the EPA for a waiver of their requirement to acquire and submit renewable identification numbers (“RINs”). The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, can grant the refiner a full or partial waiver, or deny the waiver. The EPA issued 85 refinery exemptions for 2016-2018 compliance years, undercutting the statutory renewable fuel volumes by a total of 4.0 billion gallons. In 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit vacated decisions by the EPA to extend exemptions of renewable fuel obligations to three small refineries. The Court ruled the extensions should not have been granted because the three refineries were not already in possession of exemptions. In addition, the Court ruled the economic hardship should be determined by whether compliance with RFS II alone created the hardship, not compliance with RFS II amongst other factors. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 25, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of small refiners and reversed the interpretation of “extension” of a waiver but not the economic hardship portion of the decision.



On December 7, 2021, the EPA issued proposed volumes for 2021 and 2022 and reduced the previously finalized volumes for 2020 to account for challenges for that year including the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed volumes for conventional biofuels were 13.32 billion gallons and 15.0 billion gallons for 2021 and 2022, respectively. The 2020 volumes were proposed at 12.5 billion gallons, down from the previously finalized 15.0 billion gallons. In addition, the EPA proposed denying 65 pending applications for small refinery exemptions (“SREs”) in response to the 2020 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. The EPA also proposed adding 250 million gallons of “supplemental obligation” to the 2022 proposed volumes and stated its intent to add another 250 million gallons to 2023 to address the remand of the 2016 waiver by the D.C Circuit. The EPA implemented a public notice and comment process on this announcement.

Ethanol Production



The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as “meal,” and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining “stillage” for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with a denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal by-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed, which recovers a portion of the corn value not absorbed in ethanol production. Depending on market and operating conditions, we may also sell modified distillers grains, or wet distillers grains, by removing less liquid content compared to DDGS. We also generate revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil produced at our facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets. 
The Primary Uses of Ethanol



Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Most regular gasoline is produced using blendstock with an octane rating of 84, which is then increased to 87 (the minimum octane rating required in most states) by adding 10% ethanol according to the RFA. The industry is attempting to expand ethanol blending above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The EPA has approved the use of 15% ethanol (“E-15”), which has an octane rating of 88, in gasoline for cars, SUV’s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. Previously, the EPA had not granted E-15 the same Reid vapor pressure (“RVP”) waiver as E-10 so it could only be sold from September 16 through May 31 for those vehicles in most markets. In May 2019, the EPA finalized regulatory changes to allow the same RVP waiver for E-15 for the summer months that it allows for E-10. However, in July 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the EPA ruling and stated the EPA had exceeded its authority.



Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely than gasoline that has not been oxygenated and thus reduce emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards.



Octane enhancer.  Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. Octane is a measure of fuel performance. Ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades.



Legislation



The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.

Refined Coal Facility



On August 10, 2017, we purchased, through a 95.35% owned subsidiary, the entire ownership interest of an entity that owned a refined coal facility. We began operating the refined coal facility immediately after the acquisition. Using licensed technology, our plant applied two separate chemicals to convert feedstock coal into refined coal, which was sold to the end user of the refined coal. The refined coal operating results were subsidized by federal production tax credits through November 18, 2021, subject to meeting qualified emissions reductions as governed by Section 45 of the IRC. We ceased operating the facility on November 18, 2021 and subsequently sold the facility. We began to report these results as discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2021.



Section 45 of the IRC was created by Congress to encourage the development and use of environmentally sound solutions to control harmful emissions during energy production and to facilitate and move the United States towards better compliance with global environmental energy standards. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended Section 45 of the IRC by adding provisions to incentivize the production of emission reducing refined coal. To qualify for tax credits under Section 45 of the IRC, a process must reduce coal emissions of nitrogen oxide by 20% and either sulfur dioxide or mercury by 40%.



Facilities



As of our fiscal year end, our consolidated ethanol entities owned a combined 1,122 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 278 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2021. We also own our corporate headquarters office building, consisting of approximately 7,500 square feet, located in Dayton, Ohio.
Human Capital Resources



The attraction, retention and development of employees is critical to our success. We accomplish these objectives through a variety of actions, including our competitive compensation policies, training initiatives and growth opportunities within our Company. At January 31, 2022, we had 124 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



We took measures to protect the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to meet the needs of our customers. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including our employees, and take appropriate actions to mitigate the impact, including emphasizing CDC guidelines.



We conduct regularly scheduled safety meetings and require all employees to go through safety training. We evaluate employee safety incidents monthly and investigate such incidents promptly. In addition, we conduct periodic safety audits performed by an independent third party. A portion of our incentive compensation plan rewards employees for attaining certain safety goals.



We believe we offer market competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees. In addition to competitive base wages, all employees are eligible for an incentive compensation program, a Company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare benefits, and paid time off.
