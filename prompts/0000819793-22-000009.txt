Item 1.    Business
Albany International Corp. (the Registrant, the Company, we, us, or our) and its subsidiaries are engaged in two business segments.
The Machine Clothing (“MC”) segment supplies consumable permeable and impermeable belts used in the manufacture of paper, paperboard, tissue and towel, pulp, nonwovens, fiber cement and several other industrial applications. Within the pulp and paper industry these belts are referred to as “machine clothing” or “paper machine clothing.” In other industries we serve the products we produce are generally referred to as “processing belts.”
We design, manufacture, and market paper machine clothing for each section of the paper machine and for every grade of paper. We manufacture and sell approximately twice as much paper machine clothing worldwide than any other company. Paper machine clothing products are customized, consumable products of technologically sophisticated design that utilize polymeric materials in a complex structure. The design and material composition of paper machine clothing can have a considerable effect on the quality of paper products produced and a meaningful effect on the energy and resource efficiency of the paper machines on which it is used. Principal paper machine clothing products include forming, pressing, and drying fabrics, and process belts. A forming fabric assists in paper sheet formation and conveys the very wet sheet through the forming section. Pressing fabrics are designed to carry the sheet through the press section, where water is pressed from the sheet as it passes through the press nip. In the drying section, drying fabrics manage air movement and hold the sheet against heated cylinders to enhance drying to a final moisture content between 4% to 9%, depending on the grade. 
Process belts are used in the press section to increase dryness and enhance sheet properties, as well as in other sections of the machine to improve runnability and enhance sheet qualities.
The MC segment also supplies engineered processing belts used in the manufacturing process in the pulp, corrugator, nonwovens, fiber cement, building products, and textile industries.
The MC segment sells its products directly to customer end-users in countries across the globe. MC products, manufacturing processes, and distribution channels are substantially the same in each region of the world in which we operate. The sales of paper machine clothing forming, pressing, and drying fabrics, individually and in the aggregate, accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated Net sales during one or more of the last three years. No individual customer accounted for as much as 10 percent of MC segment Net sales in any of the periods presented. A majority of MC segment Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 were for use in the production of the growing grades of tissue, containerboard, other paper categories, and other engineered fabrics, while less than 20% of MC segment Net sales were for the production of the declining newsprint and printing and writing papers categories.
The Albany Engineered Composites (“AEC”) segment, provides highly engineered, advanced composite structures to customers in the commercial and defense aerospace industries. The segment includes Albany Safran Composites, LLC (“ASC”), in which our customer, SAFRAN Group, owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest, AEC, through ASC, is the exclusive supplier to the LEAP program of advanced composite fan blades and fan cases under a long-term supply contract. The LEAP engine is used on the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX family of jets. AEC’s largest aerospace customer is the SAFRAN Group and sales to SAFRAN (consisting primarily of fan blades and cases for CFM’s LEAP engine) accounted for approximately 12 percent of the Company’s consolidated Net sales in 2021. Other significant programs served by AEC include the F-35, Boeing 787, Sikorsky CH-53K, and JASSM programs. AEC also supplies vacuum waste tanks for the Boeing 7-Series programs, and specialty components for the Rolls Royce lift fan on the F-35, as well as the fan case for the GE9X engine. In 2021, approximately 47% of the AEC segment’s sales were related to U.S. government contracts or programs.
See “Business Environment Overview and Trends” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a discussion of general segment developments in recent years.
Following is a table of Net sales by segment for 2021, 2020, and 2019.

International Operations
Our Machine Clothing business segment maintains manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Italy, Mexico, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. MC's global manufacturing footprint is designed to most efficiently meet regional customer requirements. Our AEC business segment maintains manufacturing facilities in the United States, France, Mexico, and Germany to meet customer demand in those regions.
Our global presence subjects us to certain risks, including tariffs and other restrictions on trade, and controls on foreign exchange and the repatriation of funds. While the direct impact of recent developments in global trade and tariff policy has not been significant, there is risk that the impact of such developments on companies in our supply chain will be reflected in higher costs from affected suppliers. We have a cash repatriation strategy that targets a certain amount of foreign current year earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. Changes in the trade or regulatory compliance in any country that we have significant cash balances could make it difficult to repatriate foreign earnings cost-effectively in the future.
Research and Development and Technology
We invest in research, new product development, and technical analysis with the objective of maintaining our technological leadership in each business segment. While much of our research activity supports existing products, we also engage in significant research and development activities for new technology platforms, products and product enhancements.
MC segment products are custom-designed for each user, depending on the type, size, and speed of the machine, and the products being produced. Product design is also a function of the machine section, the grade of product being produced, and the quality of the stock used. Technical expertise, judgment, and experience are critical in designing the appropriate clothing for each machine, position, and application. As a result, many employees in sales and technical functions have engineering degrees, paper mill experience, or other manufacturing experience in the markets in which they operate. Our market leadership position reflects our commitment to technological innovation. This innovation has resulted in new MC products and/or enhancements across all of our product lines.
Albany Engineered Composites designs, develops and manufactures advanced composite parts for complex aerospace applications, using a range of core technologies, including its proprietary 3D-woven reinforced composites technology, traditional 2D laminated composite structures, automated material placement, filament winding, through-thickness reinforcement, braiding, and thermoplastic pultrusion.
In addition to continuous significant investment in core research and development activities in pursuit of new proprietary products and manufacturing processes, experienced research and development employees in each business segment also work collaboratively with customers, OEMs and suppliers on targeted development efforts to introduce new products and applications in their respective markets.
Company-funded research expenses totaled $29.6 million in 2021, $25.8 million in 2020, and $26.9 million in 2019. In 2021, these costs were 3.2 percent of total Company Net sales, including $12.9 million, or 4.2 percent of Net sales, in our AEC segment. Research and development in the AEC segment includes both Company-sponsored and customer-funded activities. Some customer funded research and development may be on a cost sharing basis, in which case, amounts charged to the collaborating entity are credited against research and development costs. For customer-funded research and development in which we anticipate funding to exceed expenses, we include amounts charged to the customer in Net sales. Cost of sales associated with customer-funded research was $5.2 million in 2021, $5.1 million in 2020, and $6.8 million in 2019.

We have developed, and continue to develop, proprietary intellectual property germane to the industries we serve. Our intellectual property takes many forms, including patents, trademarks, trade names and domains, and trade secrets. Our trade secrets include, among other things, manufacturing know-how and unique processes and equipment. Because intellectual property in the form of patents is published, we often forgo patent protection and preserve the intellectual property as trade secrets. We aggressively protect our proprietary intellectual property, pursuing patent protection when appropriate. Our active portfolio currently contains over 2,400 patents, and approximately 250 new patents are typically granted each year. While we consider our total portfolio of intellectual property, including our patents, to be an important competitive advantage, we do not believe that any single patent is critical to the continuation of our business. All brand names and product names are trade names of Albany International Corp. or its subsidiaries. We have from time to time licensed some of our patents and/or know-how to one or more competitors, and have been licensed under some competitors’ patents, in each case mainly to enhance customer acceptance of new products. The revenue from such licenses is less than 1 percent of consolidated net sales.
Raw Materials
Primary raw materials for our MC products are polymer monofilaments and fibers, which have generally been available from a number of suppliers. In addition, we manufacture polymer monofilaments, a basic raw material for all types of machine clothing, at our facility in Homer, New York, which supplies approximately 25 percent of our worldwide monofilament requirements. In the AEC segment, the primary raw materials are carbon fiber and resin. While there are a number of potential suppliers of carbon fiber and other raw materials used by AEC, the use of certain suppliers may be mandated by customer agreements, and alternative suppliers would be subject to material qualification or other requirements that may preclude or delay their availability. In the case of mandated suppliers, AEC endeavors to enter into long-term supply agreements to help mitigate price and availability risks. Currently, the primary raw materials used in each segment are derived from petroleum, and are therefore sensitive to changes in the price of petroleum and petroleum intermediates.
Competition
In the paper machine clothing market, we believe that we had a worldwide market share of approximately 30 percent in 2021, while the two largest competitors each had a market share of approximately half of ours.
Price and technology are the primary means of competitive differentiation in the industry. Albany’s Machine Clothing product portfolio is broad and deep, with products for every part of the machine and a wide range of machine types and paper grades. The Company’s research and development team works closely with the sales and technical organization to develop new products to meet changes in customer needs, and also pursues targeted joint development activities with customers and equipment manufacturers to create new products. Albany’s experienced sales and technical team members – many of whom have worked in the industries that we serve - work closely with each customer to acquire deep understanding of the customer’s combination of raw materials, manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes, and paper, pulp, nonwovens or other product being produced – a combination that is unique to each customer, plant and machine. This experience and knowledge, combined with knowledge of and experience with the Company’s own extensive product portfolio, allows the sales and technical teams to ensure that the appropriate machine clothing products are being supplied for each part of the machine, to customize those products as needed for best performance, and to continuously propose new products that offer each customer the possibility of even better performance and increased savings. Our paper machine clothing solutions enable our customers to reduce energy consumption, improve resource efficiency, and help maintain and improve water quality. These efforts – which effectively integrate the Company’s experience and technological expertise into each product we sell – are reflected in the Company’s strong competitive position in the marketplace. Some of the Company’s paper machine clothing competitors also supply paper machines, papermaking equipment, and aftermarket parts and services, and often bundle clothing with original or rebuilt machines and/or aftermarket services.
The primary competitive factors in the markets in which our Albany Engineered Composites segment competes are product performance, delivery performance, quality, and price. Achieving lower weight without sacrificing strength is the key to improving fuel efficiency, which helps reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation, and is a critical performance requirement in the aerospace industry. Our broad array of capabilities in composites enables us to offer customers the opportunity to displace metal components and, in some cases, conventional composites with lower-weight, high-strength, and potentially high-temperature resistant composites. The dominant competitive factor is the relative importance the customer places on these performance benefits, which include fuel savings/ emissions reductions due to lower weight, against the possible cost advantage of more traditional metal and composite components.
