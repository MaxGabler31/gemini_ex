Item 1. Business
Synalloy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1958 as the successor to a chemical manufacturing business founded in 1945. Its charter is perpetual. The name was changed on July 31, 1967 from Blackman Uhler Industries, Inc. The Company's executive office is located at 4510 Cox Road, Suite 201, Richmond, Virginia 23060. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "Synalloy", "Company," "we" "us," and "our" refer to Synalloy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Company's business is divided into two reportable operating segments, the Metals Segment and the Specialty Chemicals Segment. The Metals Segment operates as three reporting units that include Bristol Metals, LLC ("BRISMET") and American Stainless Tubing, LLC ("ASTI") (collectively "Welded Pipe & Tube"), Palmer of Texas Tanks, Inc. ("Palmer"), and Specialty Pipe & Tube, Inc. ("Specialty"). The Metals Segment serves markets through pipe and tube and customers in the appliance, architectural, automotive and commercial transportation, brewery, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining, power generation (including nuclear), water and waste-water treatment, liquid natural gas ("LNG"), food processing, pharmaceutical, oil and gas and other industries. 
The Specialty Chemicals Segment operates as one reporting unit which includes Manufacturers Chemicals, LLC ("MC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manufacturers Soap and Chemical Company ("MS&C"), CRI Tolling, LLC ("CRI") and DanChem Technologies, Inc ("DanChem"). The Specialty Chemicals Segment produces specialty products for the pulp and paper, coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE), textile, automotive, household, industrial and institutional ("HII"), agricultural, water and waste-water treatment, construction, oil and gas and other industries.
General
Metals Segment – The segment is comprised of four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Synalloy Metals, Inc., which owns 100% of the membership interests of BRISMET, located in Bristol, Tennessee and Munhall, Pennsylvania; ASTI, located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina; Palmer, located in Andrews, Texas; and Specialty, located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas.
BRISMET manufactures welded pipe and tube, primarily from stainless steel, duplex, and nickel alloys. Pipe is produced in sizes from 3/8 inch outside diameter to 144 inches outside diameter and wall thickness from 1/4 inch up to 1 and 3/8 inches. Pipe smaller than 18 inches in outside diameter is made on equipment that forms and welds the pipe in a continuous process. Pipe larger than 18 inches in outside diameter is formed on presses or rolls and welded using a batch welding technique. Pipe is normally produced in standard 20-foot lengths, although BRISMET also has capabilities in the production of pipe without circumferential welds in lengths up to 60 feet. BRISMET is one of the few domestic producers capable of making pipe in 48-
foot lengths up to 36 inches in diameter. Additionally, BRISMET's Munhall facility manufactures ornamental stainless tube and galvanized carbon tube, as well as similar stainless pipe products as produced at the Bristol facility.
ASTI is a leading manufacturer of high-end ornamental stainless steel tube, supplying the automotive, commercial transportation, marine, food services, construction, furniture, healthcare, and other industries. ASTI's facilities are located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina. ASTI incorporates proprietary finishing capabilities and the highest levels of customer service and technical support to provide the customer with the highest quality ornamental products available in the market. ASTI's product range includes a variety of shapes, including rounds, squares, rectangles and ellipticals up to 5 inches outside diameter.
Palmer is a manufacturer of fiberglass and steel storage tanks for the oil and gas, waste water treatment and municipal water industries. As discussed in Note 4, on February 17, 2021 the Board of Directors authorized the permanent cessation of operations at Palmer and the subleasing of the Palmer facility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company permanently ceased operations and is in the process of divesting all remaining assets at the facility. 
Specialty is a leading master distributor of hot finish, seamless, carbon steel pipe and tube, with an emphasis on large outside diameters and exceptionally heavy wall thickness. Specialty's products are primarily used for mechanical and high-pressure applications in the oil and gas, heavy industrial, construction equipment, and chemical and other industries. Operating from facilities located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas, Specialty is well-positioned to serve the major industrial and energy regions in the United States. Specialty performs value-added processing on a majority of products shipped and typically processes and ships orders in 24 hours or less. Specialty plays a critical role in the domestic supply chain, by maintaining a diverse inventory of hard to find sizes of pipe and tube that support critical infrastructure applications across the United States.
At any given time, the Metals Segment relies on approximately 5 suppliers that furnish approximately 77% of total dollar purchases of raw materials and one supplier that furnishes 32% of total material purchases. The Company does not anticipate that the loss of this supplier would have a materially adverse effect on the Company as raw materials are readily available from a number of different sources, and the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its requirements.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – The segment consists of the Company's three production facilities located in Cleveland, Tennessee, Fountain Inn, South Carolina and Danville, Virginia. MC, CRI and DanChem are aggregated as one reporting unit and comprise the Specialty Chemicals Segment.
MC and CRI produce specialty formulations and intermediates for use in a wide variety of applications and industries. MC's primary product lines focus on the production of defoamers, surfactants, and lubricating agents. MC and CRI's end users include companies that supply agrochemical paper, metal working, coatings, water treatment, paint, mining, oil and gas, and janitorial and other applications. MC's and CRI's sulfation products represent a renewable resource and are alternatives to non-renewable petroleum derivatives. 
DanChem provides dedicated contract manufacturing services, as well as operating a multi-purpose plant with the ability to process a variety of difficult to handle materials including flammable solvents, viscous liquids and granular solids. DanChem has long-term relationships with a number of leading chemical companies that outsource their manufacturing production to DanChem allowing those customers to reach their target markets quicker.
The Specialty Chemicals Segment maintains three laboratories for applied research and quality control which are staffed by 18 employees, including multiple chemists.
The majority of raw materials used by the segment are available from numerous independent suppliers and approximately 29% of total purchases are from its top 5 suppliers. While some raw material needs are met by an individual supplier or only a few suppliers, the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its raw material requirements.
See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for financial information about the Company's segments.
Sales
Metals Segment – The Metals Segment utilizes a sales force comprised of inside sales employees, outside sales employees and independent manufacturers' representatives. The segment's products are sold to various distributors, OEM and end use customers.
There were no customers representing more than 10% of the Metals Segment's revenues for 2021 or 2020, respectively.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – Specialty chemicals are sold directly to various industries nationwide by sales representatives comprised of outside sales employees and independent manufacturers' representatives. The Specialty Chemicals Segment has one customer that accounted for approximately 15% of the segment's revenues for 2021 and 16% of the segment's revenues for 2020.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions
The Company is committed to a long-term strategy of reinvesting capital in our current business segments to foster organic growth and completing acquisitions that expand our manufacturing capabilities, product offerings and geographic footprint.
On October 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DanChem Technologies, Inc. ("DanChem"). The purpose of the transaction was to accelerate product development capabilities and provide entrance into new end-markets and applications within the Chemicals segment. The purchase price was $32.95 million before adjustments for working capital, transaction expenses, cash and debt. The tangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed from DanChem included accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, real property and accounts payable.
Environmental 
Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs of these assessments and/or cleanups can be reasonably estimated. Changes to laws and environmental issues, including climate change, are made or proposed with some frequency and some of the proposals, if adopted, might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. We are presently unable to quantify this risk.
Seasonality
The Company's businesses and products are generally not subject to seasonal impacts that result in significant variations in revenues from one quarter to another.
Backlogs
The Metals Segment's Welded Pipe & Tube Operations and the Specialty Chemicals Segment incur a significant dollar value of committed orders in advance of production. The backlog of open orders for the Welded Pipe & Tube Operations were $91.5 million and $40.8 million at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. The backlog of open orders for the Specialty Chemicals Segment were $12.9 million and $3.9 million at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our backlog may not be indicative of actual sales and, therefore, should not be used as a direct measure of future revenue. 
Human Capital
Safety and Wellness
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. Personal protective equipment is provided to employees to safely perform their job responsibilities. 
Because our business involves the manufacturing of physical products, many of our employees are unable to work from home. In an effort to keep our employees safe and maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented new health-related measures, including social distancing, restrictions on visitors to our facilities, limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings, limiting company travel, increasing cleanings of our facilities and providing personal protective equipment and disinfecting agents to employees.
Talent Management
Our approach to human capital management is one that seeks to foster an inclusive and respectful work environment where employees are empowered at all levels to implement new ideas, to better serve our customers and continuously improve our processes and operations. Our business results depend on our ability to manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include competition from other employers, availability of qualified individuals and opportunities for employee growth.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 707 employees, of which 638 were full-time employees. The Company considers relations with employees to be strong. The number of employees of the Company represented by unions, located at the Munhall, Pennsylvania, Mineral Ridge, Ohio, Bristol, Tennessee and Danville, Virginia facilities, is 342, or 48% of the Company's employees. They are represented by three locals affiliated with the United Steelworkers (the "USW") and one local affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers (the "UFCW"). Collective bargaining contracts for the USW locals expire at various dates between 2023 and 2024. Collective bargaining contracts for the UFCW local expires in 2024.
Our voluntary turnover rate in 2021 was approximately 23%. We monitor employee turnover rates by plant and the Company as a whole. The average employee tenure is approximately 8 years and we believe is driven by our competitive total rewards package offered to employees and development opportunities which promotes longer employee tenure.
Total Rewards
We invest in our workforce by offering a competitive total rewards package that includes a combination of salaries and wages, health and wellness benefits, retirement benefits and educational benefits. We strive to offer competitive total rewards packages and benefits for eligible employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants for positions with the Company receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status. We strive to provide an equitable and inclusive environment for all our employees with representation across all levels of our workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we live and work.
