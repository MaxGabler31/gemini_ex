Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an integrated, growth-oriented energy service company serving companies engaged in the exploration and development of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves and government-funded utilities, private utilities, public investor owned utilities, or IOUs, and co-operative utilities, or Co-Ops, through our energy infrastructure business. Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for our stockholders through organic opportunities and accretive acquisitions. Our suite of services includes pressure pumping services, infrastructure services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. Our pressure pumping services division provides hydraulic fracturing services. Our infrastructure services division provides construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our contract land and directional drilling services division provides drilling rigs and crews for operators as well as rental equipment, such as mud motors and operational tools, for both vertical and horizontal drilling. In addition to these service divisions, we also provide coil tubing services, pressure control services, flowback services, cementing services, equipment rentals and remote accommodations. We believe that the services we offer play a critical role in increasing the ultimate recovery and present value of production streams from unconventional resources as well as maintaining and improving electrical infrastructure. Our complementary suite of energy services provides us with the opportunity to cross-sell our services and expand our customer base and geographic positioning.
“Unconventional resources” references the different manner by which they are exploited as compared to the extraction of conventional resources. In unconventional drilling, the wellbore is generally drilled to specific objectives within narrow parameters, often across long, lateral intervals within narrow horizontal formations offering greater contact area with the producing formation. Typically, the well is then hydraulically fractured at multiple stages to optimize production. 
Our facilities and service centers are strategically located in Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Minnesota, West Virginia, Kentucky, Puerto Rico and Alberta, Canada primarily to serve the following areas:

• | The Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio;


• | Southern Ohio;


• | The Permian Basin in West Texas;


• | The Appalachian Basin in the Northeast;


• | The SCOOP and STACK in Oklahoma;


• | The Arkoma Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma;

• | The oil sands in Alberta, Canada.

Our operational division heads have an extensive track record in the oilfield and infrastructure service businesses with an average of over 35 years of oilfield services experience and over 25 years of infrastructure services experience. They bring valuable regional expertise and long-term customer relationships to our business. We provide our completion and production and contract land and directional drilling services to a diversified range of both public and private independent oil and natural gas producers and our infrastructure services to government-funded utilities, private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Our top five customers for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 71% of our revenue, were Gulfport Energy Corporation, or Gulfport, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, Newfield Exploration Company, or Newfield, Rice Energy, Inc., or Rice Energy, and Surge Operating LLC, or Surge Operating. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top five customers, representing 80% of our revenue, were Gulfport, Japan Canada Oil Sands Limited, or Oil Sands Limited, Rice Energy, Surge Operating and Hilcorp Energy Corporation. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our top five customers, representing 71% of our revenue, were Gulfport, EQT Production Company, Oil Sands Limited, RSP Permian LLC and Bantrel Co.
Our Services
Our revenues, operating profits and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to four reportable segments: pressure pumping services, infrastructure services, natural sand proppant services and contract land and directional drilling services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified five reportable segments consisting of pressure pumping services, well services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services. We changed our reportable segment presentation in 2017, as we no longer consider well services, which included Redback Energy Services LLC, Redback Coil Tubing LLC and Mammoth Energy Partners LLC, and our other energy services, which included Great White Sand Tiger Lodging Ltd., to be significant to the understanding of our results. We now present the results of our well service and other energy service activities as "Other." Additionally, during 2017, we added a new reportable segment for our infrastructure services activities. For additional information, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
Pressure Pumping Services
Pressure Pumping. We provide pressure pumping services, also known as hydraulic fracturing, to exploration and production companies. These services are intended to optimize hydrocarbon flow paths during the completion phase of horizontal shale wellbores. Currently, we provide pressure pumping services in the Utica Shale of Eastern Ohio, the mid-continent region in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin in Texas. Three of our fleets are currently providing services in the Utica Shale. Two of these fleets operate under a four-year contract expiring in September 2018. Additionally, we have two fleets operating in the mid-continent region and one fleet operating in the Permian Basin. Our pressure pumping services include the following:

• | Hydraulic Fracturing. We provide high-pressure hydraulic fracturing services. Fracturing services are performed to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations having low permeability such that the flow of hydrocarbons is restricted. We have significant expertise in multistage fracturing of horizontal oil and natural gas producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations.

The fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. Materials known as proppants, in our case primarily sand or ceramic beads, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to “break,” or loosen viscosity, and be forced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures created, thereby increasing the mobility of the hydrocarbons. As a result of the fracturing process, production rates are usually enhanced substantially, thus increasing the rate of return for the operator.
We own and operate fleets of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. Our hydraulic fracturing units consist primarily of a high pressure hydraulic pump, a diesel engine, a transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted to a flat-bed trailer. As of December 31, 2017, we had grown our pressure pumping business to six high pressure fleets consisting of an aggregate 117 high pressure fracturing units with pump nameplate capacity of 291,750 horsepower.
We refer to the group of fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” We operate on a 24-hour-per-day basis and we typically 
2

staff three crews per fleet. All of our fracturing units and high pressure pumps are manufactured to our specifications to enhance the performance and durability of our equipment and meet our customers’ needs.
Each hydraulic fracturing fleet includes a mobile, on-site control center that monitors pressures, rates and volumes, as applicable. From there, our field-level managers supervise the job-site by radio. Each control center is equipped with high bandwidth satellite hardware that provides continuous upload and download of job telemetry data. The data is delivered on a real-time basis to on-site job personnel, the operator and personnel at our headquarters for display in both digital and graphical form. 
An important element of fracturing services is determining the proper fracturing fluid, proppants and injection program to maximize results. In virtually all of our hydraulic fracturing jobs, our customers specify the composition of the fracturing fluid to be used. The fracturing fluid may contain hazardous substances, such as hydrochloric acid and certain petrochemicals. Our customers are responsible for the disposal of the fracturing fluid that flows back out of the well as waste water. The customers remove the water from the well using a controlled flow-back process, and we are generally not involved in that process or in the disposal of the fluid.
Master Services Agreements. We contract with most of our pressure pumping customers under master service agreements, or MSAs. Generally, our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, specify payment terms, audit rights and insurance requirements and allocate certain operational risks through indemnity and similar provision.
Infrastructure Services
Our infrastructure services business provides restoration, repair, transmission and distribution, or T&D, and commercial services. We offer a broad range of services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities, which include construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services. Our T&D services include the construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair of high voltage transmission lines, substations and lower voltage overhead and underground distribution systems. We also provide storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and other disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. In addition, we provide infrastructure services in the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States. Our commercial services include the installation, maintenance and repair of commercial wiring. 
We currently have agreements in place with government-funded utilities, private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. In particular, on October 19, 2017, one of our subsidiaries, Cobra Acquisitions LLC, or Cobra, entered into an emergency master services agreement with PREPA (such agreement, as subsequently amended through December 21, 2017, is hereinafter referred to as the initial PREPA contract). The initial PREPA contract has a one-year term and provided for up to $200.0 million of services which was initially expected to be fully utilized within a 120-day period. The scope of the work provided for in the initial PREPA contract included labor, supervision, tools and equipment to perform storm repairs at various locations in Puerto Rico. The initial PREPA contract was fully applied to services performed by Cobra as of January 3, 2018. Due to the continuing need for Cobra’s services, on January 28, 2018, Cobra and PREPA amended the initial PREPA contract to increase the total contract amount by an additional $245.4 million up to a total of $445.4 million. Under the terms of this amendment, the number of workers requested by PREPA and provided by Cobra increased to at least 882, up from 434 in the initial PREPA contract, and the billable daily rate for those workers was decreased. On February 27, 2017, Cobra and PREPA again amended the PREPA contract to further increase the contract amount by $500.0 million up to a total of $945.4 million. In addition to continuing its repair and restoration work, under the terms of this amendment Cobra will be able to source construction materials needed to rebuild the electrical infrastructure in Puerto Rico on a pass-through basis. To support its efforts, Cobra has two berthing barges with accommodations for approximately 550 people mobilized to Puerto Rico. In addition to its employees, Cobra also subcontracts additional resources where needed to assist in its repair efforts, including helicopters and pilots to erect towers and pull wire for reconnection, steel workers to fix transmission poles and rework steel damaged in the storm, road equipment and operators to carve access to work sites, tree services to clear brush and trees and security teams. Based on the current level of services provided, Cobra anticipates the additional amounts specified in the amendments will fund its activities in Puerto Rico through mid-2018.
Natural Sand Proppant Services
In our natural sand proppant business, we mine, process and sell sand. We also buy processed sand from suppliers on the spot market and resell that sand. Natural sand proppant, also known as frac sand, is the most widely used type of proppant due to its broad applicability in unconventional oil and natural gas wells and its cost advantage relative to other proppants. Natural frac sand may be used as proppant in all but the highest pressure and temperature environments and is being employed in nearly all major U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas producing basins, including those in which we operate.
3

At our Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin plants, we mine and process sand into premium monocrystalline sand (also known as frac sand), a specialized mineral that is used as a proppant. We also purchase raw or washed sand and process it at our indoor sand processing plant located in Pierce County, Wisconsin. We sell sand to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance recovery rates from unconventional wells. Our sand processing plants produce a range of frac sand sizes for use in all major North American shale basins, including a majority of the standard proppant sizes as defined by the ISO/API 13503-2 specifications. These grain sizes can be customized to meet the demands of our customers with respect to a specific well. Our supply of Jordan substrate exhibits the physical properties necessary to withstand the completion and production environments of the wells in these shale basins. Our indoor processing plant in Pierce County, Wisconsin is designed for year-round continuous wet and dry plant operation. Our processing plants in Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin have indoor dry plants designed to operate year-round and outdoor wet plants that generally operate eight months per year.
We also provide logistics solutions to facilitate delivery of our frac sand products to our customers. Our frac sand products are primarily shipped by rail to our customers in the Utica Shale, SCOOP/STACK, DJ Basin, Permian Basin and the Montney Shale in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. Our logistics capabilities in this regard are important to our customers, who focus on both the reliability and flexibility of product delivery. Because our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities near their job sites, they typically prefer product to be delivered where and as needed, which requires predictable and efficient loading and shipping capabilities. We contract with third party providers to transport our frac sand products to railroad facilities for delivery to our customers. We currently lease or have access to origin transloading facilities on the Canadian National Railway Company (CN), Union Pacific (UP), Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and the Canadian Pacific (CP) rail systems and use an in-house railcar fleet that we lease from various third parties to deliver our frac sand products to our customers. Origin transloading facilities on multiple railways allow us to provide predictable and efficient loading and shipping of our frac sand products. We also utilize a destination transloading facility in Yorkville, Ohio, to serve the Utica Shale, and utilize destination transloading facilities located in other North American resource plays, including the Montney Shale, to meet our customers’ delivery needs.
Contract Land and Directional Drilling Services
Our contract land and directional drilling business provides contract drilling and directional drilling services.
Contract Drilling. As part of our contract drilling services, we provide both vertical and horizontal drilling services to our customers. Currently, we perform our contract drilling services in the Permian Basin of West Texas. 
A majority of the wells we drill for our customers are drilled in unconventional basins or resource plays. These plays are generally characterized by complex geologic formations that often require higher horsepower, premium rigs and experienced crews to reach targeted depths. As of December 31, 2017, we owned 12 land drilling rigs, ranging from 800 to 1,500 horsepower, eight of which are specifically designed for drilling horizontal and directional wells, which continue to increase as a percentage of total wells drilled in North America and are frequently utilized in unconventional resource plays. As of December 31, 2017, three of our 12 drilling rigs were operating under term contracts with a term of more than one well or a stated period of time. To facilitate the provision of our contract drilling services, as of December 31, 2017, we also owned 42 trucks specifically tailored to move rigs and four cranes to assist us in moving rigs in the Permian Basin.
A land drilling rig generally consists of engines, a hoisting system, a rotating system, a drawworks, a mast, pumps and related equipment to circulate the drilling fluid under various pressures, blowout preventers, drill string and related equipment. The engines power the different pieces of equipment, including a rotary table or top drive that turns the drill pipe, or drill string, causing the drill bit to bore through the subsurface rock layers. Drilling rigs use long strings of drill pipe and drill collars to drill wells. Drilling rigs are also used to set heavy strings of large-diameter pipe, or casing, inside the borehole. Because the total weight of the drill string and the casing can exceed 500,000 pounds, drilling rigs require significant hoisting and braking capacities. Generally, a drilling rig’s hoisting system is made up of a mast, or derrick, a drilling line, a traveling block and hook assembly and ancillary equipment that attaches to the rotating system, a mechanism known as the drawworks. The drawworks mechanism consists of a revolving drum, around which the drilling line is wound, and a series of shafts, clutches and chain and gear drives for generating speed changes and reverse motion. The drawworks also houses the main brake, which has the capacity to stop and sustain the weights used in the drilling process. When heavy loads are being lowered, a hydromatic or electric auxiliary brake assists the main brake to absorb the great amount of energy developed by the mass of the traveling block, hook assembly, drill pipe, drill collars and drill bit or casing being lowered into the well.
The rotating equipment from top to bottom consists of a swivel, the kelly bushing, the kelly, the rotary table, drill pipe, drill collars and the drill bit. We refer to the equipment between the swivel and the drill bit as the drill stem. The swivel assembly sustains the weight of the drill stem, permits its rotation and affords a rotating pressure seal and passageway for 
4

circulating drilling fluid into the top of the drill string. The swivel also has a large handle that fits inside the hook assembly at the bottom of the traveling block. Drilling fluid enters the drill stem through a hose, called the rotary hose, attached to the side of the swivel. The kelly is a triangular, square or hexagonal piece of pipe, usually 40 feet long, that transmits torque from the rotary table to the drill stem and permits its vertical movement as it is lowered into the hole. The bottom end of the kelly fits inside a corresponding triangular, square or hexagonal opening in a device called the kelly bushing. The kelly bushing, in turn, fits into a part of the rotary table called the master bushing. As the master bushing rotates, the kelly bushing also rotates, turning the kelly, which rotates the drill pipe and thus the drill bit. Drilling fluid is pumped through the kelly on its way to the bottom. The rotary table, equipped with its master bushing and kelly bushing, supplies the necessary torque to turn the drill stem. The drill pipe and drill collars are both steel tubes through which drilling fluid can be pumped. Drill pipe comes in 30-foot sections, or joints, with threaded sections on each end. Drill collars are heavier than drill pipe and are also threaded on the ends. Collars are used on the bottom of the drill stem to apply weight to the drill bit. At the end of the drill stem is the bit, which chews up the formation rock and dislodges it so that drilling fluid can circulate the fragmented material back up to the surface where the circulating system filters it out of the fluid.
Drilling fluid, often called drilling mud, is a mixture of clays, chemicals and water or oil, which is carefully formulated for the particular well being drilled. Bulk storage of drilling fluid materials, the pumps and the mud-mixing equipment are placed at the start of the circulating system. Working mud pits and reserve storage are at the other end of the system. Between these two points the circulating system includes auxiliary equipment for drilling fluid maintenance and equipment for well pressure control. Within the system, the drilling mud is typically routed from the mud pits to the mud pump and from the mud pump through a standpipe and the rotary hose to the drill stem. The drilling mud travels down the drill stem to the bit, up the annular space between the drill stem and the borehole and through the blowout preventer stack to the return flow line. It then travels to a shale shaker for removal of rock cuttings, and then back to the mud pits, which are usually steel tanks. The reserve pits, usually one or two fairly shallow excavations, are used for waste material and excess water around the location.
There are numerous factors that differentiate drilling rigs, including their power generation systems, horsepower, maximum drilling depth and horizontal drilling capabilities. The actual drilling depth capability of a rig may be less than or more than its rated depth capability due to numerous factors, including the size, weight and amount of the drill pipe on the rig. The intended well depth and the drill site conditions determine the amount of drill pipe and other equipment needed to drill a well.
Our drilling rigs have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from 12,500 feet to 20,000 feet. Of these drilling rigs, seven are electric rigs and five are mechanical rigs. An electric rig differs from a mechanical rig in that the electric rig converts the power from its generators (which in the case of mechanical rigs, power the rig directly) into electricity to power the rig. Depth and complexity of the well and drill site conditions are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job. Power requirements for drilling jobs may vary considerably, but most of our mechanical drilling rigs employ six engines to generate between 800 and 1,500 horsepower, depending on well depth and rig design. Most drilling rigs capable of drilling in deep formations drill to measured depths greater than 10,000 to 18,000 feet. Generally, land rigs operate with four crews of five people and two tool pushers, or rig managers, rotating on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.
We believe that our drilling rigs and other related equipment are in good operating condition. Our employees perform periodic maintenance and minor repair work on our drilling rigs.
We obtain our contracts for drilling oil and natural gas wells either through competitive bidding or through direct negotiations with customers. We typically enter into drilling contracts that provide for compensation on a daywork basis. Occasionally, we enter into drilling contracts that provide for compensation on a footage basis, however, a majority of such footage drilling contracts also provide for daywork rates for work outside core drilling activities contemplated by such footage contracts and under certain other circumstances. We have not historically entered into turnkey contracts; however, we may decide to enter into such contracts in the future. It is also possible that we may acquire such contracts in connection with future acquisitions of drilling assets. Contract terms we offer generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations, the on-site drilling conditions, the type of equipment used, the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and market conditions.
Daywork Contracts. Under daywork drilling contracts, we provide equipment and labor and perform services under the direction, supervision and control of our customers. We are paid a specified operating daywork rate from the time the drilling unit is rigged up at the drilling location and is ready to commence operations. Additionally, the daywork drilling contracts typically provide for fees and/or a daywork rates for mobilization, demobilization, moving, standby time and for any continuous period that normal operations are suspended or cannot be carried on because of force majeure conditions. The daywork drilling contracts also generally provide that the customer has the right to designate the points at which casing will be set and the manner of setting, cementing and testing. Such specifications include hole size, casing size, weight, grade and 
5

approximate setting depth. Furthermore, the daywork drilling contracts specify the equipment, materials and services to be separately furnished by us and our customer. Under these contracts, liability is typically allocated so that our customer is solely responsible for the following: (i) damage to our surface equipment as a result of certain corrosive elements; (ii) damage to customer’s equipment; (iii) damage to our in-hole equipment; (iv) damage or loss to the hole; (v) damage to the underground; and (vi) costs and damages associated with a wild well. We remain responsible for any damage to our surface equipment (except for damage resulting from the presence of certain corrosive elements) and for pollution or contamination from spills of materials that originate above the surface, are wholly in our control and are directly associated with our equipment. Daywork drilling contracts generally allow the customer to terminate the contract prior to drilling to a specified depth. This right, however, is generally subject to early termination compensation, the amount of which depends on when the termination occurs.
Footage Contracts. Under footage contracts, the contractor is typically paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled, regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well. A majority of these types of drilling contracts, however, contain both footage and daywork basis provisions, the applicability of which typically depends on the depth of drilling and/or the type of services being performed. For instance, when drilling occurs below a specified drilling depth or when work is considered outside the scope of the footage basis, which we refer to as core drilling, then daywork contract terms apply similar to those described above. Otherwise, the footage contract terms apply. These include a footage rate price that is a specific dollar amount per linear foot of hole drilled within the contract footage depth. Also, under the footage contract terms, we assume more responsibility for base drilling activities compared to daywork drilling. For instance, in addition to assuming responsibility for damage to our surface equipment and damage caused by certain pollution and contamination, we are responsible for the following: (i) damage to our in-hole equipment; (ii) damage to the hole that is attributable to our performance; and (iii) any costs or expenditures associated with drilling a new hole after such damage. Our customers remain responsible for any loss to their equipment, for any damage to a hole caused by them and for any underground damage. As with contracts for daywork drilling, footage drilling contracts generally allow the customer to terminate the contract before drilling to a specified depth. This right, however, is generally subject to early termination compensation, the amount of which depends on when the termination occurs.
Because we assume higher risk in a footage drilling contract, we typically pay more of the out-of-pocket costs associated with such contracts as compared to daywork contracts. We endeavor to manage these additional risks through the use of our engineering expertise and bid the footage contracts accordingly. We typically maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, drilling hazards. However, the occurrence of uninsured or under-insured losses or operating cost overruns on our footage jobs could have a negative impact on our profitability. While we have historically entered into few footage contracts, we may enter into more such arrangements in the future to the extent warranted by market conditions.
Turnkey Contracts. Turnkey contracts typically provide for a drilling company to drill a well for a customer to a specified depth and under specified conditions for a fixed price, regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well. The drilling company would provide technical expertise and engineering services, as well as most of the equipment and drilling supplies required to drill the well. The drilling company may subcontract for related services, such as the provision of casing crews, cementing and well logging. Under typical turnkey drilling arrangements, a drilling company would not receive progress payments and would be paid by its customer only after it had performed the terms of the drilling contract in full. The risks to the drilling company under a turnkey contract are substantially greater than those under a daywork basis. This is primarily because under a turnkey contract, the drilling company assumes most of the risks associated with drilling operations generally assumed by the operator in a daywork contract, including the risk of blowout, loss of hole, stuck drill pipe, machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions and risks associated with subcontractors’ services, supplies, cost escalations and personnel.
Directional Drilling. Our directional drilling services provide for the efficient drilling and production of oil and natural gas from unconventional resource plays. Our directional drilling equipment includes mud motors used to propel drill bits and kits for measurement-while-drilling, or MWD, and electromagnetic, or EM, technology. MWD kits are down-hole tools that provide real-time measurements of the location and orientation of the bottom-hole assembly, which is necessary to adjust the drilling process and guide the wellbore to a specific target. This technology, coupled with our complementary services, allows our customers to drill wellbores to specific objectives within narrow location parameters within target horizons. The evolution of unconventional resource reserve recovery has increased the need for the precise placement of a wellbore. Wellbores often travel across long-lateral intervals within narrow formations as thin as ten feet. Our personnel are involved in all aspects of a well from the initial planning of a customer’s drilling program to the management and execution of the horizontal or directional drilling operation. 
As of December 31, 2017, we owned seven MWD kits and three EM kits used in vertical, horizontal and directional drilling applications, 58 mud motors, ten air motors and an inventory of related parts and equipment. Currently, we perform our directional drilling services in the Utica Shale, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin and Permian Basin.

Other
We also offer a variety of other energy services including coil tubing services, pressure control services, flowback services, cementing services, equipment rental services and remote accommodation services. 

Coil Tubing. Coiled tubing services involve injecting coiled tubing into wells to perform various well-servicing and workover operations. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of typically less than three inches and manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet. It is wound or coiled on a truck-mounted reel for onshore applications. Due to its small diameter, coiled tubing can be inserted into existing production tubing and used to perform a variety of services to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas without using a larger, more costly workover rig. The principal advantages of using coiled tubing in a workover include the ability to (i) continue production from the well without interruption, thus reducing the risk of formation damage, (ii) move continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe in the case of a workover rig, which must be jointed and unjointed, (iii) direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, allowing for improved stimulation fluid placement, (iv) provide a source of energy to power a downhole mud motor or manipulate down-hole tools and (v) enhance access to remote fields due to the smaller size and mobility of a coiled tubing unit. As of December 31, 2017, we had one coil tubing unit capable of running 23,000 feet of two and three eighths inch coil rated at 15,000 pounds per square inch, or psi, three coiled tubing units capable of running over 22,000 feet of two inch coil rated at 15,000 psi and two coiled tubing units capable of running over 20,000 feet of two and three eighths inch coil rated at 15,000 psi in service. 
Pressure Control. Our pressure control services consist of nitrogen and fluid pumping services. Our pressure control services equipment is designed to support activities in unconventional resource plays with the ability to operate under high pressures without having to delay or cease production during completion operations. Ceasing or suppressing production during the completion phase of an unconventional well could result in formation damage impacting the overall recovery of reserves. Our pressure control services help operators minimize the risk of such damage during completion activities. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of four nitrogen pumping units and five fluid pumping units. We provide pressure control services in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Permian Basin in West Texas. 

• | Nitrogen Services. Nitrogen services involve the use of nitrogen, an inert gas, in various pressure pumping operations. When provided as a stand-alone service, nitrogen is used in displacing fluids in various oilfield applications. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of four nitrogen pumping units capable of pumping at a rate of up to 3,000 standard cubic feet per minute with pressures up to 10,000 psi. Pumping at these rates and pressures is typically required for the unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays we serve.


• | Fluid Pumping Services. Fluid pumping services consist of maintaining well pressure, pumping down wireline tools, assisting coiled tubing units and the removal of fluids and solids from the wellbore for clean-out operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had five fluid pumping units. All five are coiled tubing double pump units capable of output of up to eight barrels per minute, and are rated for pressures up to 15,000 psi.

Flowback. Our flowback services consist of production testing, solids control, hydrostatic testing and torque services. Flowback involves the process of allowing fluids to flow from the well following a treatment, either in preparation for an impending phase of treatment or to return the well to production. Our flowback equipment consists of manifolds, accumulators, valves, flare stacks and other associated equipment that combine to form up to a total of five well-testing spreads. We provide flowback services in the Appalachian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale and mid-continent markets.

• | Production Testing. Production testing focuses on testing production potential. Key measurements are recorded to determine activity both above and below ground. Production testing and the knowledge it provides help our customers determine where they can more efficiently deploy capital. As of December 31, 2017, we had five production testing packages.


• | Solids Control. Solids control services provide prepared drilling fluids for drilling rigs with equipment such as sand separators and plug catchers. These services reduce costs throughout the entire drilling process. As of December 31, 2017, we had ten solids control packages.


• | Hydrostatic Testing. Hydrostatic testing is a procedure in which pressure vessels, such as pipelines, are tested for damage or leaks. This method of testing helps maintain safety standards and increases the durability of the pipeline. We employ hydrostatic testing at industry standards and to a customer’s desired specifications and configuration. As of December 31, 2017, we had two hydrostatic testing packages.


• | Torque Services. Torque refers to the force applied to a rotary device to make it rotate. We offer a comprehensive range of torque services, offering a customer the dual benefit of reducing costs on the rig as well as reducing hazards for both personnel and equipment. We had five torque service packages as of December 31, 2017.

7

Cementing. Cementing services involve preparing and pumping cement into place in a wellbore to support and protect well casings and help achieve zonal isolation. We currently own five twin cementers and associated equipment. We provide cementing services in the Utica Shale. 
Equipment Rentals. Our equipment rental services provide a wide range of oilfield related equipment used in drilling, flowback and hydraulic fracturing services. Our equipment rentals consist of light plants and other oilfield related equipment. Additionally, we provide water transfer services. We provide equipment rental and water transfer services in the Utica Shale, Eagle Ford Shale and mid-continent markets. 
Remote Accommodations. Our remote accommodations business provides housing, kitchen and dining, and recreational service facilities for oilfield workers located in remote areas away from readily available lodging. We provide a turnkey solution for our customers’ accommodation needs. These modular camps, when assembled together, form large dormitories, with kitchen/dining facilities and recreation areas. These camps are operated as “all inclusive,” where meals are prepared and provided for the guests. The primary revenue source for these camps is lodging fees. As of December 31, 2017, we had a capacity of 1,005 rooms, 877 of which are at Sand Tiger Lodge, our camp in northern Alberta, Canada, and 128 of which are available to be leased as rental equipment to a third party. 
Our Industries
Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and related services and products budget. The oil and natural gas industry is also impacted by general domestic and international economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries, government regulations (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of customer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity and other conditions and factors that are beyond our control.
Demand for most of our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. Oil and natural gas prices experienced a significant decline in prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 and continued into February 2016, when the closing price of oil reached a 12-year low of $26.19 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The low commodity price environment caused a reduction in the drilling, completion and other production activities of most of our customers and their spending on our products and services. During 2017, oil prices rebounded from the lows experienced in 2016 and stabilized in the $42 to $60 per barrel range. 
The reduction in demand, and the resulting oversupply of many of the services and products we provide, has substantially reduced the prices we can charge our customers for our products and services, and had a negative impact on the utilization of our services throughout 2016. With the rebound in oil prices from the lows experienced during the first part of 2016, the demand for our suite of services has increased. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the years to come. Throughout 2017, the posted price for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as WTI, ranged from a low of $42.53 per barrel, or Bbl, on June 21, 2017 to a high of $60.42 per Bbl on December 29, 2017. The recovery in commodity prices have caused the demand for our services to increase. If near term commodity prices stabilize at current levels or continue to increase, we expect to experience further increase in demand for our services and products, particularly in our completion and production, natural sand proppant and contract land and directional drilling businesses. Spears and Associates, Inc. estimates the United States drilling industry to continue to recover in 2018, with a projected 25,000 new wells being drilled, up from approximately 23,000 in 2017. In addition, both the average lateral length drilled per well and average amount of sand pumped per well is expected to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017. We expect that the projected increased drilling activity and increase in lateral length and amount of sand pumped per well will result in increased demand for our completion and production services and natural sand proppant services.
Although the ongoing volatility and depressed levels of activity are expected to persist until supply and demand for oil and natural gas come into balance, we believe that the following trends in our industry should benefit our operations and our ability to achieve our primary business objective as commodity prices recover: 
8


• | Increased U.S. Petroleum field Production. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, U.S. average petroleum field production was approximately 10.0 million barrels per day during November 2017, only 1.5% below the record high average daily petroleum field production set in 2015. U.S. average petroleum field production has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% over the period from 2009 through 2015 due to production gains from unconventional reservoirs. We expect that this continued growth will result in increased demand for our services as commodity prices continue to stabilize and increase.


• | Increased use of horizontal drilling to develop unconventional resource plays. According to Baker Hughes, the horizontal rig count on December 29, 2017 was 796, or approximately 86% of the total U.S. onshore rig count. The overall onshore rig count increased significantly from May 2016 to September 2017 from 404 rigs operating to 940 rigs operating. The horizontal rig count as a percentage of the overall onshore rig count has increased every year since 2007 when horizontal rigs represented only approximately 25% of the total U.S. onshore rig count at year-end. As a result of improvements in drilling and production enhancement technologies, oil and natural gas companies are increasingly developing unconventional resources such as tight sands and shales. Successful and economic production of these unconventional resource plays frequently requires horizontal drilling, fracturing and stimulation services. Drilling related activity for unconventional resources is typically done on tighter acre spacing and thus requires that more wells be drilled relative to conventional resources. We believe that all of these characteristics will drive the demand for our services in an improved commodity price environment.

9


• | Tight oil production growth is expected to continue to be the primary driver of U.S. oil production growth. According to the EIA, U.S. tight oil production grew from approximately 430,000 barrels per day in 2007 to over 4.6 million barrels per day in 2017, representing approximately 50% of total U.S. crude oil production in 2017. A majority of this increase came from the Eagle Ford play in South Texas, the SCOOP/STACK plays in the mid-continent of Oklahoma, the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana, and the Permian Basin in West Texas. We believe the Utica Shale and the Permian Basin, our primary business locations, will be key drivers of U.S. tight oil and natural gas production as those plays are developed further in the coming years due to the favorable well economics in those basins.


• | Horizontal wells are heavily dependent on oilfield services. According to Baker Hughes, as of December 29, 2017, horizontal rigs accounted for approximately 86% of all rigs drilling in the United States, up from 25% at year-end 2007. The scope of services for a horizontal well are greater than for a conventional well. Industry analysts report that the average horsepower, length of the lateral and number of fracture stages has continued to increase since 2008. We believe our commitment to provide services in unconventional plays, such as the Utica Shale and the Permian Basin, provide us the opportunity to compete in those regional markets where the majority of total footage is drilled each year in the United States.

10


• | New and emerging unconventional resource plays. In addition to the development of existing unconventional resource plays such as the Permian, Utica, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Barnett, Fayetteville, Cotton Valley, Haynesville, Marcellus and Woodford Shales, exploration and production companies continue to find new unconventional resources. These include oil and liquids-based shales in the Cana Woodford, Granite Wash, Niobrara, Woodford and SCOOP/STACK resource plays. In certain cases, exploration and production companies have acquired vast acreage positions in these plays that require them to drill and produce hydrocarbons to hold the leased acreage. We believe these unconventional resource plays will increasingly drive demand for our services as commodity prices continue to recover as they typically require the use of extended reach horizontal drilling, multiple stage fracture stimulation and high pressure completion capabilities. We also believe we are well positioned to expand our services in two major unconventional plays, the Utica Shale in Ohio and the Permian Basin in West Texas.


• | Need for additional drilling activity to maintain production levels. With the increased maturity of the onshore conventional and, in many cases, unconventional resource plays, oil and natural gas production may be characterized as having steeper initial decline curves. Given average decline rates and the substantial reduction in activity over the past year, we believe that the number of wells drilled is likely to increase in coming years as commodity prices continue to recover. Once a well has been drilled, it requires recurring production and completion services, which we believe will also drive demand for our services.

Electric Infrastructure Industry
The electrical infrastructure industry involves the construction and maintenance of the electrical power grid, including, but not limited to, power generation, high voltage transmission lines, substations and low voltage distribution lines, all of which connect power generation facilities to end users. The industry also provides storm repair and restoration services in response to storms and other disasters, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. The industry is highly fragmented with more than 3,000 separate utility companies identified in the United States in 2016, spread across the following subgroups: IOUs, private utilities and Co-Ops. 
Demand for our services is driven by the construction of transmission lines, substations and distribution networks and is determined by the level of expenditures of utility companies. While expansion of the electrical grid is occurring, the majority of capital expenditures spent in recent years has surrounded the repair and maintenance of existing networks. Another factor that significantly influences the level of spending in the industry are natural disasters, which impact the electrical grid. These natural disasters include, but are not limited to, thunderstorms, ice storms, snow storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires and lightning strikes. 
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, our safety record and customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, although our work with PREPA has not been obtained through a formal bid process. Consequently, price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected.
We believe that the age of the existing infrastructure across the United States and the spending trends in North America will benefit our operations and our ability to achieve our business objectives. 
Natural Sand Proppant Industry 
Demand growth for frac sand and other proppants is primarily driven by advancements in oil and natural gas drilling and well completion technology and techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as overall industry activity growth. These advancements have made the extraction of oil and natural gas increasingly cost-effective in formations that historically would have been unprofitable to develop, resulting in a greater number of wells being drilled. Demand for proppant declined in 2015 and throughout most of 2016 with reduced well completion activity; however, we believe that demand for proppant will continue to grow, as it did throughout 2017, over the long-term, primarily driven by the increase in the average amount of proppant consumed per horizontal rig and as a result of the following demand drivers:

• | improvements in drilling rig productivity (from, among other things, pad drilling), resulting in more wells drilled per rig per year;


• | increases in the number of wells drilled per acre;


• | increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;


• | increases in the number of fracture stages per lateral foot in the typical completed horizontal wellbore;

11


• | increases in the volume of proppant used per fracturing stage; and


• | recurring efforts to offset steep production declines in unconventional oil and natural gas reservoirs, including the drilling of new wells and secondary hydraulic fracturing of existing wells.

As demand for raw frac sand increased dramatically through 2014, the supply of raw frac sand failed to keep pace, resulting in a supply-demand disparity. As a result, a number of existing and new competitors announced supply expansions and greenfield projects. However, there are several key geological, operational and economic constraints to increasing raw frac sand production on an industry-wide basis, including:

• | the difficulty of finding frac sand reserves that meet API specifications and consisting of the mesh size in demand;


• | the difficulty of securing contiguous frac sand reserves large enough to justify the capital investment required to develop a processing facility with a higher base of fixed costs;


• | the challenges of identifying frac sand reserves with the above characteristics that either are located in close proximity to oil and natural gas reservoirs or have rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins;


• | the hurdles of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities;


• | local opposition to development of facilities, especially those that require the use of on-road transportation, including hours of operations and noise level restrictions, in addition to moratoria on raw frac sand facilities in multiple counties in Wisconsin and other states which hold potential sand reserves; and


• | the typically long lead time required to design and construct sand processing facilities that can efficiently process large quantities of high quality frac sand.

As a result of the decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity that took place in 2015 and throughout most of 2016, many frac sand suppliers significantly delayed or canceled their expansion or greenfield projects. In addition, several existing facilities were temporarily or permanently idled, often due to high cost of production.
In 2017, several new and existing suppliers announced planned capacity additions of frac sand supply, particularly in the Permian Basin. We expect frac sand supply to lag growth in demand over the coming months and quarters. While planned capacity may exceed the expectations for frac sand demand, the collectively available industry capacity is constrained due to (i) availability of the grades of sand that are currently in demand, (ii) general operating conditions and normal downtime and (iii) logistics constraints. The industry is expected to add capacity over the next 12 to 18 months, particularly in the Permian Basin; however, we do not expect such supply to be available in the volume grades or timeframe needed to efficiently meet the increasing demand.
Our proppant sand reserves consist of Northern White silica sand, giving us access to a range of high-quality sand grades meeting or exceeding all API specifications, including a mix between concentrations of coarse grades (20/40 and 30/50 mesh size) and finer grades (40/70 and 100 mesh size). Our sample boring data and our historical production data have indicated that our reserves contain deposits of approximately 40% 40 mesh size or coarser substrate. The coarseness and conductivity of Northern White frac sand significantly enhances recovery of oil and liquids-rich gas by allowing hydrocarbons to flow more freely than is sometimes possible with native sand. The low acid-solubility increases the integrity of Northern White frac sand relative to other proppants with higher acid-solubility, especially in shales where hydrogen sulfide and other acidic chemicals are co-mingled with the targeted hydrocarbons. In addition, its crush resistant properties enable Northern White frac sand to be used in deeper drilling applications than the frac sand produced from many native mineral deposits.
We believe that the coarseness, conductivity, sphericity, acid-solubility, and crush-resistant properties of our Northern White sand reserves and our facilities’ connectivity to rail and other transportation infrastructure afford us an advantage over our competitors and make us one of a select group of sand producers capable of delivering high volumes of frac sand that is optimal for oil and natural gas production to all major unconventional resource basins currently producing throughout North America.
Our Strengths
Our primary business objective is to grow our operations and create value for our stockholders through organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. We believe that the following strengths position us well to capitalize on activity in unconventional resource plays and achieve our primary business objective:

• | Modern fleet of hydraulic fracturing equipment designed for horizontal wells. Our service fleet is predominantly comprised of equipment designed to optimize recovery from unconventional wells. Three of our pressure pumping fleets with total combined horsepower of 132,500 were built in 2017 and our other three fleets with a total combined

12

horsepower of 159,250 have an average age of approximately four years. We believe that our modern fleet of quality equipment will allow us to provide a high level of service to our customers and capitalize on future growth in the unconventional resource plays that we serve.

• | Strategic geographic positioning, including primary presence in the Utica Shale and the Permian Basin. We currently operate facilities and service centers to support our operations in major unconventional resource plays in the United States, including the Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio, the Permian Basin in West Texas, the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma, the Marcellus Shale in West Virginia, the Granite Wash in Oklahoma and Texas, the Cana Woodford Shale and the Cleveland Sand in Oklahoma, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. We believe our geographic positioning within active oil and natural gas liquids resource plays will benefit us strategically as activity increases in these unconventional resource plays.


• | Long-term contractual and other regional relationships with a stable customer base. We are party to two four-year contracts with Gulfport to provide pressure pumping services and natural sand proppant services through September 2018. In addition, our operational division heads and field managers have formed long-term relationships with our customer base. We believe these contractual and other relationships help provide us a more stable and growth-oriented client base in the unconventional shale markets as well as the infrastructure markets that we currently serve. Our customers include large independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, government-funded utilities, private utilities, public IOUs and Co-Ops. Our top five customers for the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 71% of our revenue were Gulfport, PREPA, Newfield, Rice Energy and Surge Operating. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top five customers, representing 80% of our revenue, were Gulfport, Oil Sands Limited, Rice Energy, Surge Operating and Hilcorp.


• | Experienced management and operating team. Our operational division heads have an extensive track record in the oilfield and infrastructure service businesses with an average of over 35 years of oilfield services experience and over 25 years of infrastructure services experience. In addition, our field managers have expertise in the areas in which they operate and understand the regional challenges that our customers face. We believe their knowledge of our industries and business lines enhances our ability to provide innovative, client-focused and basin-specific customer service, which we also believe strengthens our relationships with our customers.

Our Business Strategy
We intend to achieve our primary business objective by the successful execution of our business plan to strategically deploy our equipment and personnel to provide pressure pumping services, natural sand proppant services, contract land and directional drilling services and other energy services in unconventional resource plays, including the Utica Shale in Ohio, the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin in West Texas. In the case of our infrastructure services businesses, we intend to achieve our primary business objective by the successful execution of our business plan to strategically deploy equipment and personnel to provide infrastructure services in Puerto Rico as well as the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States. We believe our oil and natural gas services optimize our customers’ ultimate resources recovery and present value of hydrocarbon reserves and that our infrastructure services optimize our customers’ ability to maintain, improve and expand their infrastructure. We seek to create cost efficiencies for our customers by providing a suite of complementary services designed to address a wide range of our customers’ needs. Specifically, we intend to create value for our stockholders through the following strategies:

• | Capitalize on the recovery in activity in the unconventional resource plays. Our oil and natural gas service equipment is designed to provide a broad range of services for unconventional wells, and our operations are strategically located in major unconventional resource plays. During 2017, the posted price for WTI stabilized and increased following the significant declines experienced in 2016. The average price per barrel in 2017 was $50.97 with a low of $42.53 per barrel on June 21, 2017 to a high of $60.42 per barrel on December 29, 2017. If commodity prices stabilize at current levels or recover further, we expect to experience further increase in demand for our services and products. We intend to capitalize on the anticipated increase in activity in these markets and diversify our operations across additional unconventional resource basins. Our core operations are currently focused in the Utica Shale in Ohio, the SCOOP/STACK in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin in West Texas. We intend to continue to strategically deploy assets to these and other unconventional resource basins and will look to capitalize on further growth in emerging unconventional resource plays as they develop.


• | Leverage our broad range of services for unconventional wells for cross-selling opportunities. We offer a complementary suite of services and products. Our pressure pumping and well services activities provide hydraulic fracturing services for unconventional wells. Our infrastructure services division provides construction, upgrade,

13

maintenance and repair services to the electrical infrastructure industry. Our natural sand proppant services division mines, processes and sells natural sand proppant for hydraulic fracturing. Our drilling services division adds drilling capabilities to our well-related services. Additionally, we provide coil tubing services, pressure control services, flowback services, cementing services, equipment rental and remote accommodations. We intend to leverage our existing customer relationships and operational track record to cross sell our services and increase our exposure and product offerings to our existing customers, broaden our customer base and expand opportunistically to other geographic regions in which our customers have operations, as well as to create operational efficiencies for our customers.

• | Expand through selected, accretive acquisitions. To complement our organic growth, we intend to actively pursue selected, accretive acquisitions of businesses and assets, primarily related to our completion and production services, infrastructure services and natural sand proppant services, that can meet our targeted returns on invested capital and enhance our portfolio of products and services, market positioning and/or geographic presence. We believe this strategy will facilitate the continued expansion of our customer base, geographic presence and service offerings. We also believe that our industry contacts and those of Wexford, our equity sponsor and largest stockholder, may be helpful to facilitate the identification of acquisition opportunities. We may use our common stock as consideration for accretive acquisitions.


• | Maintain a conservative balance sheet. We seek to maintain a conservative balance sheet, which allows us to better react to changes in commodity prices and related demand for our services, as well as overall market conditions. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and as of December 31, 2016, had no outstanding debt. During 2017, we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund $133.9 million in capital expenditures and three accretive acquisitions, and as of December 31, 2017, had outstanding debt totaling $99.9 million and a cash balance of $5.6 million. We intend to use a portion of our cash flows from operations to reduce our outstanding debt in 2018.


• | Expand our services to meet expanding customer demand. The scope of services for horizontal wells is greater than that for conventional wells. Industry analysts have reported that the average horsepower required for current completion designs, amount of sand per lateral foot, length of lateral and number of fracture stages has continued to increase since 2008. We consistently monitor market conditions and intend to expand the capacity and scope of our business lines as demand warrants in resource plays in which we currently operate, as well as in new resource plays. If we perceive unmet demand in our principal geographic locations for different service lines, we will seek to expand our current service offerings to meet that demand.


• | Expand our energy infrastructure business unit in the Lower 48 and in Puerto Rico. Industry analysts have reported that spending in the T&D industry will exceed $60 billion each year through 2022. We consistently monitor market conditions and intend to expand the capacity and scope of our energy infrastructure services as demand warrants in geographic areas in which we currently operate, as well as in new geographic areas. 


• | Leverage our experienced operational management team expertise. We seek to manage the services we provide as closely as possible to the needs of our customer base. Our operational division heads have long-term relationships with our largest customers. We intend to leverage these relationships and our operational management team’s expertise to deliver innovative, client focused and services to our customers.

Marketing and Customers
Our customers consist primarily of independent oil and natural gas producers, government-funded utilities, private utilities, IOUs, Co-Ops and land-based drilling contractors in North America. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately 364 and 239 customers, respectively, including Gulfport, PREPA, Newfield, Rice Energy and Surge Operating. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 71%, 80%, and 71%, respectively, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Gulfport and PREPA accounted for 30% and 29%, respectively, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Gulfport and Oil Sands Limited accounted for 57% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Gulfport and EQT Production Company accounted for 46% and 12%, respectively, of our revenue. Although we believe we have a broad customer base and wide geographic coverage of operations, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer decided not to continue to use our services, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
14

Operating Risks and Insurance
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the energy services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause:

• | personal injury or loss of life;


• | damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment; and


• | suspension of operations.

In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 
Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
We maintain commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business auto, commercial property, motor truck cargo, umbrella liability, in certain instances, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance policies providing coverages of risks and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations, coverage would be available under our policy for any surface or subsurface environmental clean-up and liability to third parties arising from any surface or subsurface contamination. We also have certain specific coverages for some of our businesses, including our remote accommodation services, pressure pumping services and contract and directional drilling services. 
Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” on page 23 of this annual report for a description of certain risks associated with our insurance policies.
Safety and Remediation Program
In the energy services industry, an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced and skilled workforce. Many of our large customers place an emphasis not only on pricing, but also on safety records and quality management systems of contractors. We have committed resources toward employee safety and quality management training programs. Our field employees are required to complete both technical and safety training programs. Further, as part of our safety program and remediation procedures, we check treating iron for any defects on a periodic basis to avoid iron failure during hydraulic fracturing operations, marking such treating iron to reflect the most recent testing date. We also regularly monitor pressure levels in the treating iron used for fracturing and the surface casing to verify that the pressure and flow rates are consistent with the job specific model in an effort to avoid failure. As part of our safety procedures, we also have the capability to shut down our pressure pumping and fracturing operations both at the pumps and in our data van. In addition, we maintain spill kits on location for containment of pollutants that may be spilled in the process of providing our hydraulic fracturing services. The spill kits are generally comprised of pads and booms for absorption and containment of spills, as well as soda ash for neutralizing acid. Fire extinguishers are also in place on job sites at each pump.
Historically, we have used third-party contractors to provide remediation and spill response services when necessary to address spills that were beyond our containment capabilities. None of these prior spills were significant, and we have not experienced any incidents, citations or legal proceeding relating to our hydraulic fracturing services for environmental concerns. To the extent our hydraulic fracturing or other energy services operations result in a future spill, leak or other 
15

environmental impact that is beyond our ability to contain, we intend to engage the services of such remediation company or an alternative company to assist us with clean-up and remediation.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, a company must provide services and products that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, drilling services contractors, government-funded utilities, private utilities, IOUs and Co-Ops at competitive prices.
We provide our services and products across the United States, Puerto Rico and in Alberta, Canada and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small energy service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies and energy infrastructure companies. Our major competitors in pressure pumping services include Halliburton Company, U.S. Well Services, LLC, Schlumberger Limited, Keane Group, Inc., C&J Energy Services Ltd., RPC Incorporated, Complete Energy Services, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services, Inc. and FTS International, Inc. Our major competitors for our infrastructure services business include MYR Group, Inc, Quanta Services, Inc, MasTec, Inc. and EMCOR Group, Inc. Our major competitors in our natural sand proppant production and sales business are Badger Mining Corporation, Fairmount Minerals, Ltd., Hi-Crush Partners LP, Preferred Proppants LLC, Unimin Corporation, Smart Sand, Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. In our contract land and directional drilling services segment, our primary competitors include Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Precision Drilling Corporation, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., Cactus Drilling, Sidewinder Drilling, Inc., Baker Hughes Incorporated, Weatherford International Ltd. and various regional and local service providers. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service and products, reputation for safety and technical proficiency, availability and price. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services and products based on the local leadership and expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services and products.
Regulation
We operate under the jurisdiction of a number of regulatory bodies that regulate worker safety standards, the handling of hazardous materials, the transportation of explosives, the protection of human health and the environment and driving standards of operation. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance which is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. The oil and natural gas and infrastructure industries are subject to environmental and other regulation pursuant to local, state and federal legislation.
Transportation Matters
In connection with our transportation and relocation of our equipment and shipment of frac sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, driver licensing and insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous materials (HAZMAT). Our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, a unit within the United States Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Matters such as the weight and dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
Certain motor vehicle operators require registration with the Department of Transportation. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The Department of Transportation periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria which could result in a suspension of operations. The rating scale consists of “satisfactory,” “conditional” and “unsatisfactory” ratings. As of December 31, 2017, all of our trucking 
16

operations have “satisfactory” ratings with the Department of Transportation. We have undertaken comprehensive efforts that we believe are adequate to comply with the regulations. Further information regarding our safety performance is available at the FMCSA website at www.fmcsa.dot.gov.
In December 2010, the FMCSA launched a program called Compliance, Safety, Accountability, or CSA, in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System, or SMS, which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow FMCSA to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. However, the agency has announced a future intention to revise its safety rating system by making greater use of SMS data in lieu of on-site compliance audits of carriers. At this time, we cannot predict the effect such a revision may have on our safety rating.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or related to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry and infrastructure industry in general. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, which affect our activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions.
Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous.” Also, in December 2015, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA, or the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, generally imposes liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” are subject to strict liability, that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of 
17

removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.
NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with oil and gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing naturally occurring radioactive materials, or NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because certain of the properties presently or previously owned, operated or occupied by us may have been used for oil and gas production operations, it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with NORM.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the Corps. In September 2015, a new EPA and the Corps rule defining the scope of the jurisdiction of the EPA and the Corps over wetlands and other waters became effective. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In the
interim, the EPA and the Corps have resumed nationwide application of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term
“waters of the United States.” Further, on February 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the
relevant executive agencies to review the rules and to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise them, as appropriate under the
stated policies of protecting navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth, reducing uncertainty, and
showing due regard for Congress and the states. On July 27, 2017, the EPA and the Corps published a proposed rule to
rescind the 2015 rules, and, on November 22, 2017, the agencies published a proposed rule to maintain the status quo
pending the agencies review of the 2015 rules.
The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption “—Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Noncompliance with these requirements may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, our sand proppant production operations are subject to air permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources regulating our emission of fugitive dust and other constituents. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas and infrastructure projects.

Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or collectively referred to as GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Subsequently, the EPA adopted two sets of related rules, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, which we refer to as the tailoring rule, in May 2010, and it became effective January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring EPA’s air permitting regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s decision on GHG permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 2, 2016.
Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our customers’ facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce GHG emissions. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of such allowances is expected to escalate significantly.
In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.
Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.
In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment
advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common 
19

law. As a result, private individuals or public companies may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against certain energy companies and could allege personal injury, property damages, or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our productivity and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
Endangered Species Act
Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, as amended, or the ESA, may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
A portion of our business is dependent on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals (also called “proppants”) under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as “Class II” Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, the EPA previously announced its plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plans. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. Furthermore, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, were proposed in recent sessions of Congress.
On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes New Source Performance standards, which we refer to as NSP standards, to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended the NSP standards to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and 
20

natural gas sector. However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions.
In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On June 21, 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside the rule, holding that the BLM lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM has appealed the decision to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. State and industry groups have challenged this rule in federal court, asserting that the BLM lacks authority to prescribe air quality regulations. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. Also, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to suspend or delay certain requirements of the 2016 methane rule until January 17, 2019. Further legal challenges are expected. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented, and what impact they would have on our operations.
There are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. Any increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our reserves and results of operations.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our customers’ fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative or regulatory changes could cause us or our customers to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.

Regulation of Infrastructure Services
In our infrastructure business, our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including:

• | licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers;


• | regulations relating to worker safety;


• | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects;


• | wage and hour regulations;


• | building and electrical codes; and


• | special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.

We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our energy infrastructure services and that we are in
substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.
Regulation of Sand Proppant Production
The MSHA has primary regulatory jurisdiction over commercial silica operations, including quarries, surface mines, underground mines and industrial mineral processing facilities. MSHA representatives perform at least two annual inspections of our production facilities to ensure employee and general site safety. To date, these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards, and we believe we are in material compliance with MSHA requirements.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although changes to the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry could affect the demand for our services, we would not expect to be affected any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the industry with similar operations.
Drilling. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and


• | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.

Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the plugging and abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. Although the Corps does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
State Regulation. The states in which we or our customers operate regulate the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including through requirements relating to the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may also regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but they may do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or locations our customers can drill.
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources, or the ODNR, has enacted a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the construction of well pads. Under these new rules, operators must submit detailed horizontal well pad site plans certified by a 
22

professional engineer for review by the ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management prior to the construction of a well pad. These rules have resulted in increased construction costs for operators. 
The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
OSHA Matters
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,846 full time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land, technical, regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees.
