Item 1. Business
General Information
 
We are an exploration stage company with limited revenues and a short operating history.  Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We locate and lease existing wells for reactivation for the production of oil and gas that we will then sell, through an operator, to oil and gas brokers and gatherers.  The gas sometimes may be sold directly to the public utility companies.
 
Our focus for the current fiscal year will be on pursuing the acquisition of leases and/or existing oil and gas wells which have potential for production.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status under the JOBS Act
 
AO&G qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”).
 
The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuers known as "emerging growth companies." Emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion (as indexed for inflation) during their most recently completed fiscal year. The JOBS Act is intended to facilitate public offerings by emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and its regulations. An emerging growth company will retain that status until the earliest of:

· | The first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed $1 billion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its IPO;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | The date on which the company has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least $700 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial and Audit Requirements
 
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements. Pursuant to these scaled requirements, emerging growth companies may:
 
 
· | Provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their IPO Registration Statement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 3
 
 
 
· | Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditor's attestation regarding the issuer's internal controls.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Offering Requirements
 
In addition, during the IPO offering process, emerging growth companies are exempt from:
 
 
· | Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the IPO registration statement; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The requirement initially to publicly file IPO Registration Statements. Emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft Registration Statements and any amendments with the SEC. Public filings of the draft documents must be made at least 21 days prior to commencement of the IPO "road show."
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Public Company Requirements
 
Emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:
 
 
· | The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The requirements under Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We received our initial funding of $10,000 through the sale of common stock to Robert Gelfand, a former officer and director, who purchased 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share in January, 2012.  On July 12, 2012, the Company completed its registered offering raising $50,000 from the sale of 10,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
We have a total of 75,000,000 authorized common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share with 20,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2017.
 
Our plan of operation is to search for appropriate oil and gas leases.  In addition to the cost of any potential property lease, we anticipate spending $10,000 on professional fees, including fees payable for complying with reporting obligations, $5,000 in general administrative costs and $1,125 in working capital. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are therefore expected to be approximately $50,000.

Distribution Methods
 
We plan to distribute oil and gas that we produce through oil and gas gathering companies with the gas sometimes being sold directly to public utility companies.  The operator of the wells generally make the arrangements with the gathering companies.
 
If we do find a gas well for lease the distribution agreements for gas generally provide for the company to tap into the distribution line of a gas distribution company, and we would be paid for our gas at the market price at the time of delivery less any transportation charge from the gas transmission company. These charges can range from 5% upward of the market value of the gas, depending on the competition among transmission companies in the area of the wells.
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, modernizing existing wells and marketing oil and natural gas we may produce. The majority of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we plan to operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
 
Current competitive factors in the domestic oil and gas industry are unique. The actual price range of crude oil is largely established by major international producers. Pricing for natural gas is more regional; however, more favorable prices can usually be negotiated for larger quantities of oil and/or gas product. In this respect, while we believe we have a price disadvantage when compared to larger producers, we view our primary pricing risk to be related to a potential decline in international prices to a level which could render our production uneconomical.
 
We will be committed to use the services of the existing gathering companies the area of production. This potentially gives such gathering companies certain short-term relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs, because obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company may require substantial additional costs.
 
Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets
 
There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Regulation of Transportation of Oil
 
Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

Our sales of crude oil will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state.
 
Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
 
Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas
 
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 
Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Although the FERC’s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.
 
Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we may eventually operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
 
Regulation of Production
 
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All states, in which we may operate in the future, have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced from wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations, although companies can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We have no significant raw materials. However, if we are successful in our plan of operations we may make use of numerous oil field service companies.
Major Customers
 
If we are successful in our plan of operation, we will principally sell our oil and natural gas production through our operator to marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. Generally, in areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to storage facilities. We believe that the loss of any of these oil and gas purchasers would not materially impact our business, because we could readily find other purchasers for our oil and gas as produced.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
We have no patents, trademarks, licenses, concessions, or labor contracts. We will pay royalties to mineral owners and owners of overriding royalties on any future oil and gas leases. These royalties usually are 25%. The leases are good and royalties are owed as long as there is production on the property.
Environmental Compliance and Risks
 
Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Historically, most of the environmental regulation of oil and gas production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is significant gas and oil production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency. However, while we believe this generally to be the case for our production activities in Louisiana, there are various regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and other governmental agencies that would govern significant spills, blow-outs, or uncontrolled emissions.
 
At the federal level, among the more significant laws and regulations that may affect our business and the oil and gas industry are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as “CERCLA” or Superfund; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as “RCRA”; the Clean Air Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.
 
Compliance with these regulations may constitute a significant cost and effort for us. No specific accounting for environmental compliance has been projected by us at this time. We are not presently aware of any environmental demands, claims, or adverse actions, litigation or administrative proceedings in which our acquired property is involved or subject to, or arising out of any predecessor operations.
 
In the event of a breach of environmental regulations, these environmental regulatory agencies have a broad range of alternative or cumulative remedies which include: ordering a clean-up of any spills or waste material and restoration of the soil or water to conditions existing prior to the environmental violation; fines; or enjoining further drilling, completion or production activities. In certain egregious situations the agencies may also pursue criminal remedies against us or our principal officer.

Research and Development Costs during the Last Two Years
 
We have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.
 
Employees and Employment Agreements
 
Our only employee is our officer, Shane Reeves.  Mr. Reeves currently devotes 8-10 hours per week to company matters and after receiving funding or a substantial increase in revenues he plans to devote as much time as the board of directors determines is necessary to manage the affairs of the company.  There are no formal employment agreements between the company and our current employee.
Reports to Security Holders
 
We voluntarily make available an annual report including audited financials on Form 10-K to security holders.  We file the necessary reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including but not limited to, reports on Form 8-K as necessary, annual reports on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
 
The public may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.
