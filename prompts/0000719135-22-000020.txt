Intellectual Property
We rely on our intellectual property that we have developed or acquired over the years including patents, trade secrets, technical innovations and various licensing agreements to provide our future growth and build our competitive position. We have been issued 44 patents in the United States and 25 foreign patents. We have 14 pending patent applications in the United States and 51 pending foreign applications. We have 9 U.S. registered trademarks, 3 international registered trademarks, and 6 pending international trademark applications. As we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio, we believe it is critical for us to continue to invest in filing patent applications to protect our technology, inventions and improvements. However, we can give no assurance that competitors will not infringe on our patent rights or otherwise create similar or non-infringing competing products that are technically patentable in their own right.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We are committed to producing the most technically advanced and highest quality products of their kind available on the market. We manufacture the majority of our products on our premises in Clearwater, Florida and at our facility located in Sofia, Bulgaria, both of which are certified under the ISO international quality standards and are subject to continuing regulation and routine inspections by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulations relating to our quality system, medical device complaint reporting, and adherence to FDA restrictions on promotion and advertising. In addition, we are subject to regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act and other federal, state and local regulations, as well as international laws and regulations.
Apyx Bulgaria, EOOD operates an approximately 25,000 square foot, ISO13485 certified and FDA registered manufacturing facility located in the capital city of Sofia, which houses manufacturing, development and assembly operations.
We work closely with our suppliers to ensure that our raw material inventory (i.e., semiconductors and plastics) needs are met, while maintaining high quality and reliability. To date, we have experienced some delays in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements, but such delays have not caused a meaningful backlog of sales orders. However, it is possible that a prolonged COVID-19 disruption to the global supply chain could cause a backlog of sales orders in the future.  We continue to work to find other sources of supply, where feasible, and have expedited the shipments of certain raw material items to adequately maintain our production and safety stock levels, resulting in higher shipping costs. We have also experienced some impact on the purchase prices of our raw materials due to inflation, global inventory shortages. and increased demand across the manufacturing sector.
We maintain collaborative arrangements with three foreign suppliers, including our contract component manufacturer located in Ningbo, China, under which we request the development of certain products which we purchase pursuant to purchase orders.  Our purchase order commitments are never more than one year in duration and are supported by our sales forecasts. To our knowledge, none of the products that we source are through entities manufacturing in the Xinjiang province. 
During late 2019, we entered into a joint venture with our Chinese supplier to establish a foundation for the manufacturing and sale of our Advanced Energy products into the Chinese market. As of the date of this report, the joint venture has not commenced its principal operations. 
Backlog
The value of unshipped factory orders is not material.
Sustainability
We have created a strong environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) structure by introducing a new cross-functional ESG team which has been working with senior management, our board and other stakeholders to develop an ESG framework that is aligned with our corporate mission, vision and values. We are evaluating and plan to publish our first ESG-focused disclosure in 2022, under the sector-specific ESG standards published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).

APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

Our Two Business Segments 
We currently have two reportable segments: Advanced Energy and OEM. The Corporate and Other category includes certain unallocated corporate and administrative costs which are not specifically attributed to either reportable segment. Net assets are shared, therefore, not allocated to the reportable segments.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our OEM segment contributed 11.4% of our consolidated total revenue and our Advanced Energy segment contributed 88.6% of our consolidated total revenue.
Advanced Energy Segment
Overview
Our product portfolio consists of our Helium Plasma Technology that is marketed and sold as Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market and J-Plasma® in the hospital surgical market. Our primary focus is on the cosmetic surgery market where Renuvion® offers plastic surgeons, fascial plastic surgeons and cosmetic physicians a unique ability to provide controlled heat to the tissue to achieve their desired results. This technology has U.S. FDA clearance, CE mark, and clearance for sale in multiple other countries and is generally indicated for the cutting, coagulation and ablation of soft tissue. The system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit ("ESU"), a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. The proprietary radiofrequency ("RF") energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is unique in that it allows for the application of heat to tissue in a way that is not possible with traditional monopolar or bipolar technologies. This technology has been the subject of forty-two peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, abstracts, and posters. It also continues to be the subject of numerous presentations at traditional and cosmetic surgery conferences around the world.
This technology initially received FDA clearance in 2012 and a CE mark in December 2014, which enables us to sell the product in the European Union. In 2014, we created and trained a direct sales force dedicated to sell this technology. In 2015, we continued the commercialization process for our Helium Plasma Technology with a multi-faceted strategy designed to accelerate adoption of the product. This strategy primarily involved deployment of a dedicated sales force, developing product line extensions and expanding the specialties in which this technology can become the “standard of care“ for certain procedures.
During 2021, we continued our full-scale, global, commercialization efforts for Renuvion® in the cosmetic and plastic surgery markets. As of December 31, 2021, we had a direct sales force of 31 field-based selling professionals and utilized 2 independent sales agencies. We also had 5 sales managers. This selling organization is focused on the use of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market, supported by our global medical affairs team. This global team of clinical support specialists focuses on supporting our users to ensure optimal outcomes for their patients. In addition, we have invested in training programs and marketing-related activities to support accelerated adoption of Renuvion® into physicians' practices.
From 2015 through 2021, we launched numerous new extensions to our Helium Plasma product lines in an effort to target new surgical procedures, users, and markets. Most notably, throughout 2021, we continued our launch of our Renuvion® Apyx Plasma RF handpieces (“APR”) around the world. These handpieces were designed with improved ergonomics and usability for our Renuvion® customers. As a result of our sales, marketing and product development initiatives, we have significantly increased the number of physicians using our Helium Plasma Technology by expanding usage to include the cosmetic surgery market in the U.S., and the cosmetic surgery market as well as the surgical oncology market outside the U.S.
In order to assist us in leveraging our Helium Plasma Technology’s precision and effectiveness in multiple surgical specialties, we continue to utilize our Medical Advisory Board which currently consists of 5 members representing the plastic surgery, fascial plastic surgery, and cosmetic procedure specialties.
Our commercial strategy in the U.S. and outside the U.S. is primarily focused on advancing the usage of Renuvion® in the cosmetic surgery market. In some of our international markets, we continue to provide support to our customers who have adopted our J-Plasma® technology for the hospital surgical market. We continue to develop a clinical and regulatory strategy, and corresponding marketing campaigns, to support our market focus. We also continue to expand the reach of our global medical affairs team in order to provide clinical support to our customers in all markets.
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

We continue to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our Renuvion® technology for the long-term benefit of the Company and its stakeholders, and this may adversely affect our short-term operating performance and cash flows, particularly over the next 12 to 18 months. While we believe that these investments have the potential to generate additional revenues and profits in the future, there can be no assurance that our Helium Plasma Technology will continue to be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized.
Customers
In the U.S., we primarily sell our Renuvion® products through our direct sales force to physicians, cosmetic surgery offices and surgical centers. Outside of the U.S., all of our products are sold primarily through our distributor network.
Products
Our Advanced Energy Products consist of our Helium Plasma Technology lines (Renuvion® and J-Plasma®). These product lines consist of a multifunction generator, a handpiece and a supply of helium gas. Radiofrequency ("RF") energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize an electrode. When helium gas passes over the energized electrode, helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the patient in the form of a precise helium plasma beam. The energy delivered to the patient via the helium plasma beam is unique in that it allows for the application of heat to tissue in a way that is not possible with traditional monopolar or bipolar technologies. 
Helium Plasma Generator
Throughout 2021, we continued our launch of the newest generation of our Renuvion® generator, the Renuvion® System 3, to markets outside the U.S. This high frequency electrosurgical generator can be used for delivery of RF energy and/or helium plasma to cut, coagulate and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. This new generator was built for use with our Renuvion® APR handpieces, and features enhanced capabilities such as a joule counter, capable of displaying energy delivered to the patient, and new Auto-Bipolar functionality, which expands the surgical capabilities of the system. These new product releases continue to expand the procedure base for our Helium Plasma Technology by providing surgeons with the tools they need to access additional anatomic locations and perform specific procedures.
Disposables Portfolio
We offer a variety of different hand pieces for open and laparoscopic procedures. The helium-based plasma generated from these devices has been shown to provide increased precision and control and cause less thermal damage to tissue than CO2 laser, argon plasma and RF energy products currently available on the market. The technology has a general indication and can be used for cutting, coagulating and ablating soft tissue. The advantages of helium plasma continue to be studied throughout the medical and scientific communities. We believe that cosmetic surgery applications are the primary area of opportunity for this technology. In 2020, we completed the launch of our new generation APR handpieces in the U.S. market. During 2021, we began to launch these new handpieces in our international markets, designed specifically for minimally invasive use, with improved ergonomics and safety features. 
Competition
Currently, we are the only company with helium-based plasma and retractable blade products. However, there are RF-based competitors, argon plasma competitors, and CO2 laser competitors for our target market. We believe our competitive position did not change in 2021.
FDA and Other Government Regulations
Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA, as well as by other regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based on the risks associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Those three classes are: 
• Class I, the lowest risk products, which require compliance with medical device general controls, including labeling, establishment registration, device product listing, adverse event reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations; 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

• Class II, comprising moderate-risk devices, which also require compliance with general controls and in some cases, so called special controls that may include performance standards, particular labeling requirements, or post-market surveillance obligations; typically a Class II device also requires pre-market review and clearance by FDA of a pre-market notification (also referred to as a “510(k) application”) as well as adherence to the quality system regulations/good manufacturing practices for devices; and
• Class III, high-risk devices that are often implantable or life-sustaining, which also require compliance with the medical device general controls and quality system regulations, but which generally must be approved by FDA before entering the market, through a more-lengthy pre-market approval (PMA) application. Approved PMAs can include post-approval conditions and post-market surveillance requirements, analogous to some of the special controls that may be imposed on Class II devices. 
Before being introduced into the U.S. market, our products must obtain marketing clearance or approval from FDA through the 510(k)-pre-market notification, or premarket approval processes. To date, our products have been classified as Class II, moderate-risk medical devices that are substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device and, thus, have been subject to the 510(k) review and clearance process. 
510(k) Pre-Market Notification Process 
Class II devices typically require pre-market review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the submission of a 510(k)-pre-market notification before the device may be marketed. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must demonstrate that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I - this device to which the new device is compared is called the “predicate device.” In some cases, we may be required to perform clinical trials to support a claim of substantial equivalence. If clinical trials are required, we may be required to submit an application for an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must be cleared by the FDA prior to the start of a clinical investigation, unless the device and clinical investigation are considered non-significant risk by the FDA or are exempt from the IDE requirements. 
Whether or not an IDE is required for a clinical study involving a medical device, an appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) must review and approve the study protocol before it is initiated. It generally takes three months from the date of the pre-market notification submission to obtain a final 510(k) clearance decision from the FDA, but it can be significantly longer. After a medical device receives a 510(k)-clearance letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the new device for one or more specific indications for use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires the submission of a new 510(k) notification or could require de novo classification or a PMA. The FDA allows each company to make this determination, but the FDA can review the decision as part of routine compliance audits of the company. If the FDA disagrees with a company’s decision not to seek prior FDA authorization, the FDA may require the company to seek additional 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA also can require the company to cease marketing and/or recall the medical device in question until its regulatory status is resolved.
Post-Marketing Compliance Obligations 
Regardless of which pre-market pathway a medical device uses to reach the U.S. market, after a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
• the FDA’s Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other good manufacturing practice and quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process (unless a device category is exempt from this requirement by the FDA, such as in the case of many Class I devices); 
• labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses (known as off-label uses), as well as requirements to provide adequate information on both risks and benefits; 
• medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA any event that the company learns of in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
• correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and device recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health; 
APYX MEDICAL CORPORATION

• post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to Class II or III devices if the FDA has issued a post-market surveillance order and the failure of the device would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences, the device is expected to have significant use in the pediatric population, the device is intended to be implanted in the human body for more than one year, or the device is intended to be used to support or sustain life and to be used outside a user facility; 
• regular and for-cause inspections by FDA to review a manufacturer’s facility and its compliance with applicable FDA requirements; and 
•     the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations.
On March 14, 2022, the FDA posted a Medical Device Safety Communication ("Communication") that warns consumers and health care providers against the use of our Advanced Energy products outside of their FDA-cleared indications for general use in cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue during open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. We continue to work with the FDA towards securing 510(k) clearance for additional indications. We are in the process of evaluating what effects, if any, the Communication will have on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 
Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) 
The International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) recognized that a global approach to auditing and monitoring the manufacturing of medical devices could improve their safety and oversight on an international scale. The IMDRF established a work group that developed specific documents to advance a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP). The Medical Device Single Audit Program allowed MDSAP recognized Auditing Organizations to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer to satisfy the relevant requirements of the regulatory authorities participating in the program. Based on its evaluation of the MDSAP Final Pilot Report, the MDSAP Regulatory Authority Council (the international MDSAP governing body) determined that the MDSAP Pilot had satisfactorily demonstrated the viability of the Medical Device Single Audit Program. In October, 2021, we underwent a successful annual MDSAP audit our registrar GMED SAS. There were no observations related to safety or efficacy of our products noted during this MDSAP audit. The FDA accepts MDSAP audit reports as a substitute for routine Agency inspections.
OEM Segment 
Overview
We leverage our expertise in the design, development and manufacturing of electrosurgical equipment by producing generators and related accessories for large, well-known medical device manufacturers through original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") agreements, as well as start-up companies with the need for our energy-based designs. In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement with Symmetry Surgical in 2018, we entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement for a ten-year term, whereby we will manufacture certain products and sell to them at agreed upon prices. Revenue, costs and expenses resulting from this agreement are reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of income or loss from operations of our OEM reporting segment.
