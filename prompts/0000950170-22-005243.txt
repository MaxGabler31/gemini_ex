 Overview

We are a clinical-stage microbiome therapeutics company leveraging our Human-First Discovery platform to develop a novel class of orally administered biological drugs. The microbiome consists of trillions of microbes that live symbiotically in and on every human and are essential to our health. When key microbes are lost, the resulting dysbiosis can increase susceptibility to immune disorders, infections, neurological conditions, cancer and other serious diseases. We are developing novel therapeutics designed to deliver missing microbes and their clinically relevant biochemical functions to correct dysbiosis and the diseases that emerge from it. Our Human-First Discovery platform uses reverse translation to identify diseases of dysbiosis and to design microbiome therapeutics that address them. We believe that our differentiated platform, rich pipeline and the broad therapeutic potential of this new field of medicine position us to transform care for a wide range of unmet medical needs.
 
Our lead product candidate, CP101, is an orally administered complete microbiome therapeutic in development for the prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, or CDI. In June 2020, we reported positive topline data from our Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI, which we refer to as the PRISM3 trial, and in November 2021, we reported positive topline data from our open-label, Phase 2 clinical trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI, which we refer to as the PRISM-EXT trial.  We have designed a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the PRISM4 trial, to serve as our second pivotal trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI. On March 1, 2022, we announced that enrollment in PRISM4 was paused following receipt of a clinical hold letter on February 24, 2022 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in connection with our investigational new drug application, or IND, for CP101, requesting additional information regarding our SARS-CoV-2 donor screening protocols, including, among other things, that we address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the informed consent process, additional detail on how samples are shipped to the vendor performing the SARS-CoV-2 testing of the donor material and how inconclusive test results will be handled. We are also preparing to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial of FIN-211 in autism spectrum disorder, or ASD; however, because FIN-211 includes donor-derived components, the clinical hold related to our IND for CP101 will also delay initiation of our clinical trial in ASD. We plan to manufacture additional lots of CP101 and FIN-211 to satisfy the FDA's requests related to SARS-CoV-2 screening and testing. We are currently evaluating the extent of the delay the clinical hold and related manufacturing activities will have on the timing for our clinical trials in CDI and ASD, which we expect to be at least one quarter based on manufacturing timelines; we describe the clinical hold and related matters further in the section entitled “Our Clinical Programs”.
 
CP101: Our Lead Product Candidate for the Prevention of Recurrent CDI
 Our lead candidate, CP101, consists of a microbial community harvested from rigorously screened healthy donors that is lyophilized and formulated in orally administered capsules designed to release at the appropriate location in the gastrointestinal tract. CP101 is designed to deliver a complete microbiome, addressing the community-level dysbiosis that characterizes CDI. Patients with CDI suffer from severe diarrhea, which can progress to toxic megacolon and death, with more than 44,000 CDI-attributable deaths annually in the United States. In addition to the human cost, the economic impact of CDI is significant, with 2.4 million in-patient days and more than $5 billion in direct treatment costs each year in the United States alone. CDI often returns after cessation of antibiotic treatment because antibiotics do not address the dysbiosis that underlies this disease. We estimate there are approximately 200,000 cases of recurrent CDI annually in the United States.
In June 2020, we announced that PRISM3, the first pivotal trial of CP101, which was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial, met its primary efficacy endpoint. Overall, 74.5% of participants who received a single administration of CP101 achieved a sustained clinical cure, defined as the absence of CDI through week 8, achieving statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint, with a clinically meaningful 33.8% relative risk reduction for CDI recurrence compared to placebo. In October 2021, we shared additional data from PRISM3 showing that the proportion of participants with sustained clinical cure (defined as absence of CDI recurrence) through week 24 remained significantly higher in the CP101 arm compared to the placebo arm. In PRISM3, the prevalence of adverse events was similar across CP101 and placebo arms, with no treatment-related serious adverse events in the CP101 arm.

In November 2021, we announced positive topline results from the 132-participant PRISM-EXT trial. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRISM-EXT trial was sustained clinical cure (defined as absence of CDI recurrence) through 8 weeks post-treatment. Overall, 80.3% of participants who received a single oral administration of CP101 following standard-of-care, or SOC, antibiotics in PRISM-EXT achieved sustained clinical cure through week 8. At week 24, 78.8% of participants had
   sustained clinical cure. In the PRISM-EXT trial, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events reported and CP101 exhibited an overall safety profile consistent with the profile observed in PRISM3. The PRISM-EXT results are consistent with and build on our previously reported PRISM3 results.

CP101 Program for the Treatment of Chronic HBV
 
Following a strategic review of our pipeline and business, we announced in March 2022 the decision to pause the development of CP101 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We believe this decision will allow us to maximize our working capital available for investment in our wholly-owned recurrent CDI and ASD programs. We may continue our research efforts in HBV in the future as our portfolio continues to mature.
 
Developing Capabilities for Targeted and Enriched Consortia Product Candidates
 
In addition to developing CP101, a Complete Consortia product candidate designed to address community-level dysbiosis, or disruption across many functional pathways and species, we are also developing Targeted Consortia product candidates that consist of individual bacteria grown from master cell banks to engage narrower pathway-level dysbiosis. The ability to pursue both of these product strategies enables us to tailor our product candidates to the pathophysiology of each indication. This combination of capabilities also enables us to pursue a third product strategy, Enriched Consortia, which addresses dysbiosis at both the community and pathway level. These product strategies are summarized in the schema below:

   


Our Human-First Discovery platform informs each of these product strategies using clinical interventional data, through a process of reverse translation. Core to this strategy is our ability to deploy our proprietary machine learning algorithms to mine clinical data generated internally and by third parties, including experience with fecal microbiota transplantation, or FMT, a procedure that has been used to restore the gut microbiome and address community-level dysbiosis. FMT is a procedure, not a product. It is not approved by the FDA, and there are no standards for testing, processing and delivery of FMT, though it typically requires a colonoscopy. Despite these limitations, FMT has been used to treat more than 60,000 patients, with hundreds of clinical studies ongoing across a range of disease areas. We believe that this data can be used to (1) identify diseases where addressing dysbiosis provides therapeutic benefit, (2) reveal the mechanisms that underlie these results and (3) uncover key microbes and functional pathways that drive these clinical outcomes. We believe this reverse translation strategy is the optimal approach to developing microbiome therapeutics, providing causal insights that cannot be gleaned from preclinical in vitro or in vivo experiments alone. We further believe that we are uniquely positioned to execute
   on this strategy because of our proprietary FMT database and biorepository, our broad network of collaborators that supports the rapid growth of our data assets and our proprietary machine learning algorithms that enable the efficient translation of clinical data into therapeutic insights.

FIN-211: Our Product Candidate to Address Gastrointestinal and Behavioral Symptoms of ASD
 
We have used our Human-First Discovery platform to develop FIN-211, an Enriched Consortia product candidate that we are advancing to address the gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms of ASD. Scientific research in human and animal models have highlighted the “gut-brain axis” linking dysbiosis to neurological and neurobehavioral conditions, as the microbiome impacts the enteric nervous system and the production of neurotransmitters. This basic research is supported by a growing body of third-party clinical research. An open-label, proof-of-concept FMT trial observed that, two years after treatment, 33% of the study participants who had previously been diagnosed with ASD were below the ASD diagnostic cutoff score for the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), a commonly used ASD diagnostic tool. In another open-label randomized, controlled trial, children with ASD receiving FMT and behavioral therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in their behavioral symptoms compared to those receiving behavioral therapy alone. Both studies also observed marked improvements in the gastrointestinal symptoms that many autistic children suffer from. There are no FDA-approved therapies for the core symptoms of ASD and the total financial burden of care for this condition is estimated to exceed $100 billion in the United States annually. We have received feedback from the FDA that demonstrating a benefit for either gastrointestinal or behavioral symptoms of ASD could support a biologics license application. Building on our discussions with the FDA, we aim to continue to validate behavioral instruments as part of our clinical development plans. We have designed FIN-211 to address both behavioral and gastrointestinal aspects of ASD, which we plan to assess, along with safety and tolerability, in a Phase 1b clinical trial of FIN-211 in ASD. We believe FIN-211 has the potential to transform care for patients with ASD.
TAK-524 (formerly FIN-524) Ulcerative Colitis Development Program in Collaboration with Takeda
 
In collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, we are also developing Targeted Consortia product candidates for inflammatory bowel disease. In August 2021, we announced that Takeda elected to accelerate its leadership role in the FIN-524 ulcerative colitis development program, now known as TAK-524. Accordingly, we transferred the program to Takeda for further development. The design of product candidate TAK-524 leverages computational and molecular analysis of data from 146 patients treated with FMT and 19 observational studies of an additional 2,210 patients. We believe that the development program for TAK-524, which is a Targeted Consortia product candidate composed of strains grown from master cell banks, is not affected by the clinical hold related to our IND for CP101.
 
FIN-525 for the Treatment of Crohn's Disease in Collaboration with Takeda
 
We continue to partner with Takeda on discovery efforts targeting the development of FIN-525 for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. We believe that the development program for FIN-525, which is a Targeted Consortia product candidate composed of strains grown from master cell banks, is not affected by the clinical hold related to our IND for CP101.

   Our Pipeline
   
   The Human Microbiome and its Impact on Disease

The human microbiome describes the community of more than 30 trillion microbes that reside on and inside the human body. By evolving together over millions of years, microbes and humans have developed an intricate and mutually beneficial relationship that has only recently been uncovered. Enabled by the genomic revolution, researchers have discovered that humans carry over 1,000-fold more microbial genes than host genes and that microbiome signaling is fundamentally intertwined with many aspects of human physiology ranging from immune and metabolic functions to neurological function and reproductive health. The deep inter-relationship between microbes and their human hosts is a co-evolution that has resulted in a learned dependency, leaving humans now reliant on inputs from this previously unrecognized organ system.

Disruption of the gut microbiome is associated with a large number of diseases that have dramatically increased in prevalence among populations in developed countries over the past century. We believe these epidemiological trends are linked to changes in the microbiome, which if reversed could potentially address an underlying cause of these diseases and change the epidemiology as a result. The rise of these chronic illnesses coincides with our adoption of a number of practices that disrupt the microbiome: more than 42 billion doses of antibiotics are administered annually, many killing 40-60% of microbial species in the gut; a third of babies in the United States today are born by caesarean sections, and are consequently unable to inherit this organ from their mother; and a highly sanitized and artificial environment, absent the environmental inputs expected by our microbiome, applies further pressure on this ecosystem within us. The effects of these environmental inputs coalesce around the gut microbiome resulting in dysbiosis and these changes are linked to a wide variety of chronic diseases. For example, antibiotic exposure doubles the risk of developing IBD, as well as significantly increases the risk of developing over 10 types of cancer. Early microbiome disruption is also associated with ASD, autoimmune indications such as celiac diseases, and allergies and asthma, and microbiome disruption later in life has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Importantly, in multiple animal models, these diseases can be induced by microbiome disruption and corrected by restoration, providing evidence of causality. For several of these therapeutic areas, this has been further bolstered by clinical data with FMT.

The effects of gut microbiome dysbiosis reverberates throughout the body, both because immune cells are heavily concentrated in the gut, where more than 70% of the body’s immune cells are located, and because microbial metabolites enter systemic circulation, acting on organs throughout the body. For example, researchers at the California Institute of Technology showed that the transfer of the microbiome from human donors with ASD into microbiome-free mice promoted hallmark autistic behaviors. In addition, a large body of research has documented the connection between over a dozen different microbiome species and molecular pathways connecting the gut’s enteric nervous system to the brain. We believe the gut-brain axis is but one example of how the microbiome can provide therapeutic benefits to diseases beyond the gut.

Restoring the microbiome, or its inputs, is an opportunity to directly address the underlying causes of many diseases driven by dysbiosis. Many existing drugs target only the downstream symptoms of disease, for example, anti-tumor necrosis factor, or anti-TNF, biologics are prescribed to IBD patients to suppress systemic immunity, without addressing the underlying drivers of gut inflammation and immune dysregulation. This can lead to unintended side effects as well as an incomplete resolution of disease. Treating the root cause of disease is more likely to deliver a therapeutic breakthrough and for many diseases of dysbiosis, we believe that only through the restoration of the critical physiological role of the microbiome organ can this be achieved. Currently there are no microbiome therapeutics approved by the FDA. We believe that our ability to target both community- and pathway-level dysbiosis through our Human-First Discovery platform uniquely positions us to deliver on this transformational opportunity to improve human health through microbiome therapeutics.
      

Our Approach

We develop microbiome therapeutics following a three-stage process that combines aspects of traditional drug development with the unique opportunities enabled by our platform. In the first stage, Human-First Discovery, we use human data to identify promising clinical indications, microbial mechanisms and a consortia that engages these mechanisms. The second stage consists of IND-enabling activities, including bioprocess and formulation development, quality control and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, production. The third stage is clinical development, in which we leverage customized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays to understand optimal dosing and delivery. Importantly, data from clinical development can feed directly back into Human-First Discovery, enabling iterative development of differentiated follow-on product candidates.
1.Our Human-First Discovery platform is designed to significantly reduce drug development time and translational risk. We have developed our Human-First Discovery platform to choose clinical indications, reveal mechanisms and create microbial compositions that engage our target mechanisms. 
 •Clinical Indication Selection: We aim to de-risk development by targeting indications with known underlying dysbiosis, an understanding of relevant mechanistic pathways and, critically, data from FMT that provide proof-of-concept that a microbial intervention has the potential to positively impact clinically meaningful outcomes. We have exclusive access to certain data and samples from groups that we believe are the largest providers of FMT in the world, including OpenBiome, which has delivered more than 60,000 FMTs to over 1,000 clinical sites. With more than 300 third-party clinical studies evaluating FMT around the world, we are uniquely well positioned to leverage this trove of clinical data to identify promising new drug development opportunities. We believe that by requiring a foundation of clinical data prior to indication selection and program initiation, our programs are already significantly de-risked before we begin development. 
 •Target Identification and Validation: We use translational assays and high-throughput sequencing to generate curated datasets from FMT studies, observational clinical studies, and sometimes preclinical models, for each target indication. We then use our expertise in microbial ecology enhanced by our proprietary machine learning tools to identify microbiome compositions and functions that are deficient in our target population and whose restoration is causally linked to improved outcomes. We believe that observational clinical studies and preclinical models are valuable for generating mechanistic hypotheses which can then be validated using interventional data from FMT. Taken together, these efforts provide molecular and microbial targets, specific metabolites or bacteria, that are linked to clinical outcomes. 
 •Candidate Selection and Consortia Design: To engage these targets, we deliver designed microbial consortia. The capability to deliver both a complete microbiome and targeted microbes gives us the flexibility to engage a diversity of mechanisms and therefore develop treatments for a wide range of indications. In diseases characterized by community-level dysbiosis like CDI, we are able to deploy Complete Consortia product candidates like CP101. In diseases where we are able to target pathway-level dysbiosis like IBD, we are able to deploy Targeted Consortia product candidates like TAK-524. Importantly, we have obtained exclusive access to 

   a library of more than 10,000 samples from certain donors that have each been administered to patients through FMT. We are able to cryo-revive and manufacture strains from these samples, enabling precise matching of the exact strain that was associated with clinical outcomes with FMT. We believe that this direct chain of custody from a clinical sample into a Targeted Consortia significantly reduces translational risk and is uniquely enabled by our proprietary partnerships. We are also able to engage both the Targeted and Complete Consortia product strategies in a single Enriched Consortia product candidate like FIN-211 for conditions like ASD that have both community- and pathway-level dysbiosis. We believe we are uniquely positioned to align product strategy with mechanism because of our capabilities to address community- or pathway-level dysbiosis.
2.Our IND-enabling workflow drives accelerated advancement into the clinic. We have developed a standardized workflow of key IND-enabling activities, transforming consortia designed to engage key microbial mechanisms into IND-ready product candidates. 
 •Bioprocess and Formulation Development: We have developed proprietary methods for growing, harvesting, purifying, preserving and delivering microbiome consortia. Of particular note, our advanced lyophilization technology enables the preservation of a complete microbiome in a stable formulation with at least two years of stability at 2°–8°C and up to six months of stability at room temperature to accommodate excursions during delivery and administration. Furthermore, we have developed orally administered, targeted release technologies, enabling intestinal release that facilitates robust pharmacokinetics. We believe that our deep expertise in bioprocess and formulation development have, and will continue to, enable rapid development of differentiated products. 
 •Quality Control and Product Safety: Unlike other product candidates in development, we have developed manufacturing processes that do not rely on non-specific biocides like ethanol to exclude potential pathogens. Instead, each of our product candidates leverages molecular screening technology to exclude potential pathogens and harmful antibiotic resistance or virulence elements. This technology enables us to exclude unwanted agents without compromising potentially beneficial microbes. In addition to these purity assays, we have also developed both culture-based and culture-independent measures of viability to provide consistent potency across lots. 
 •cGMP Production: We have developed cGMP production capabilities as a strategic asset, internalizing key activities that we believe we are uniquely positioned to execute, while externalizing activities that can be completed by third parties, in order to maximize our capital efficiency. As an example of this strategy in action, we are developing cGMP production capabilities for CP101, an orally administered Complete Consortia product candidate. With nearly a decade of operational experience and know-how enabling our Complete Consortia manufacturing platform, we believe we are uniquely positioned to enable this manufacturing process. By contrast, we have worked closely with third parties for the production of certain Enriched Consortia and Targeted Consortia product candidates. For these product candidates, there are rapidly maturing providers able to leverage analogous experience with large scale fermentation, including the required capital equipment and infrastructure to enable cGMP manufacture of these product candidates.
 3.Our clinical development strategy is designed to enable rapid progression, expansion and iteration. 
 •Progression: We have developed a suite of customized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays to maximize learning from our clinical programs to guide progression through clinical development. Our pharmacokinetic assays quantitatively assess the engraftment, or colonization in the intestine, of our consortia. Our pharmacodynamic assays measure the production of microbial metabolites and their downstream effects on the host. 
 •Expansion: When we initiate clinical development of a new program, we aim not only to inform the progression of the specific program under evaluation, but also to inform expansion into other indications. As an example, having determined that we are able to engraft a diverse microbial community and effectively restore missing metabolic pathways with CP101 for recurrent CDI, we are now able to use similar compositions in other indications that are tied to community-level dysbiosis. Because this community-level dysbiosis is common to many microbiome-associated diseases, we believe this particular product strategy may have broad applications, such that clinical validation in one indication de-risks the development of other indications with similar characteristics.
 •Iteration: In addition to positioning our clinical development and translational medicine strategy to generate data that may inform expansion opportunities into new indications, we also believe that clinical data generated from 

   the development of product candidates like FIN-211 will provide a rich pool of data that we can mine with our Human-First Discovery platform to inform follow-on product candidates in the same indication with even more favorable product attributes. In this way, our clinical development is designed to feed back into discovery, enabling iterative improvement and life cycle management as we establish franchises in new indications.
Our Clinical Programs
CP101 for the Treatment of Recurrent CDI
Overview

Our lead product candidate, CP101, is an orally administered, complete microbiome therapeutic capsule designed to deliver an intact, functional microbiome to durably repair community-level dysbiosis. CP101 contains microbial communities harvested from rigorously screened, healthy human stool samples that have been purified, tested, stabilized, characterized and formulated in acid-resistant capsules to facilitate intestinal release after passage through the stomach.

Pathogen exclusion in CP101 is based on proprietary testing and characterization technology developed through discussions with the FDA; unlike other orally administered microbiome therapeutic candidates in development, it does not rely on non-specific biocides such as ethanol, which inactivate both beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Instead, our technology enables us to identify suitable microbial communities prior to manufacture, without requiring destructive interference in the healthy community needed to repair community-level dysbiosis. This enables CP101 to deliver a complete consortium of microbial communities rather than narrow and variable subsets of the microbiome. Our product qualification strategy is supported by the proprietary chemistry and processing techniques that optimize community viability during lyophilization, processing and administration. This fully integrated manufacturing process is designed to consistently deliver a complete microbiome.

Our production process for CP101 is designed to be scalable. We typically collect many samples from each donor and we are able to produce many treatments from each sample collected. As a result, a small pool of donors can support a large production base. For example, we believe a pool of 200 active donors could support production of approximately 100,000 treatments of CP101 annually. Furthermore, our process is designed to yield a favorable stability profile, with at least 24 months of stability at 2°–8°C and up to six months of stability at 25°C to allow for temperature excursions during delivery and administration. We believe this favorable stability profile will simplify supply chain logistics and enable more convenient care. CP101 has received Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for the prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, or recurrent CDI. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides expedited review and access to collaborate with the FDA on rapid development of CP101.
 
Clinical Hold
 
Following receipt of a clinical hold letter from the FDA related to our IND for CP101 on February 24, 2022, or the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter, we paused enrollment in PRISM4, our Phase 3 clinical trial of CP101 in recurrent CDI. In the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter, the FDA requested additional information about our SARS-CoV-2 donor screening protocols, including, for example, additional detail on how samples are shipped to the vendor performing the SARS-CoV-2 testing of the donor material and how inconclusive test results will be handled, as well as updating the informed consent process to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including, for example, the limitations of laboratory screening.
 
In March 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued a public safety alert regarding the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through the use of donor-derived investigational microbiome therapies and the need for additional safety precautions. At that time, the FDA placed our IND for CP101 on partial clinical hold, requiring us to implement new SARS-CoV-2 screening measures for any microbiota material donated on or after December 1, 2019 and to address the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the informed consent process. At that time, the FDA also placed the IND of OpenBiome, a manufacturer that we had contracted with to produce clinical raw material, on a partial clinical hold for the same reasons. Notwithstanding the partial clinical hold notices, we were able to continue dosing patients in our then-ongoing PRISM-EXT trial of CP101 in recurrent CDI as all of the CP101 lots used for PRISM-EXT were manufactured from material donated prior to December 1, 2019.
 
In January 2021, OpenBiome was released from partial clinical hold after implementing, among other things, a direct testing method for SARS-CoV-2. In March 2021, we acquired certain manufacturing assets from OpenBiome, and in November
   2021, we began dosing participants in PRISM4 with CP101 lots that had been screened for SARS-CoV-2 using the same testing method and vendor used by OpenBiome.

Following communications with the FDA in January 2022, on February 24, 2022, the FDA sent the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter to us stating that the FDA required additional information about our SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols and related informed consent language, and that a clinical hold remains in effect until the FDA's requests have been satisfactorily addressed. The February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter did not reference any adverse clinical outcome experienced in any of our clinical trials. We have informed the FDA that participants were dosed in PRISM4 while the clinical hold was in effect and we are conducting a quality investigation of the matter. We are communicating with the FDA regarding the quality investigation, and we have committed to addressing any relevant findings prior to proceeding with enrollment in PRISM4. We have submitted a Complete Response to the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter and we are communicating with the FDA to resolve the clinical hold as soon as possible.

On March 17, 2022, we received an additional letter from the FDA, or the March 2022 Letter, requesting changes to the testing algorithm used to diagnose suspected CDI recurrences in PRISM4, as well as additional information about the proposed statistical analysis plan for PRISM4 and the validation package for one of our release tests. We are unable to proceed with enrollment in PRISM4 until the FDA removes the clinical hold, we address findings from our related quality investigation, we complete related manufacturing activities to satisfy the FDA's requests related to SARS-CoV-2 screening and testing (which includes manufacturing additional lots of CP101), and we satisfactorily address the matters raised in the March 2022 Letter. We are currently evaluating the extent of the delay these activities will have on the anticipated timing for resuming enrollment in PRISM4 and, based on manufacturing timelines, we expect at least a one-quarter delay.
 Indication Overview

Clostridioides difficile, or C. difficile, is a toxin-producing, spore-forming bacterium that causes severe and persistent diarrhea in infected individuals. C. difficile expresses toxins that lead to inflammation of the colon, severe diarrhea and abdominal pain, as well as potentially more serious clinical outcomes including toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers CDI to be one of the top five most urgent antibiotic resistant threats and the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States. We estimate that there are over 450,000 cases of primary CDI and approximately 200,000 cases of recurrent CDI annually in the United States, collectively resulting in more than 44,000 CDI-attributable death per year. In addition to this human toll, the economic impact is substantial, with 2.4 million inpatient days and greater than $5 billion in direct treatment costs each year in the United States. Between 2001 and 2012, there was an increase in the annual CDI incidence of 43%; however, cases of multiply recurrent CDI increased 188% over that same period.
 Rationale for Microbiome Therapeutics in Recurrent CDI

Dysbiosis: Observational clinical data suggests that patients with recurrent CDI have significant community-level dysbiosis compared to healthy controls, with reduced microbiome diversity, in part, due to the many courses of antibiotics that are typically used to treat these patients. Initial episodes of CDI are predominantly linked to treatment with antibiotics, creating a direct link between dysbiosis and disease onset.

Mechanism of Action: The microbiome plays an important role in the pathophysiology of recurrent CDI, and third-party preclinical models and human studies support our understanding of this mechanism. Among healthy individuals, an intact microbiome outcompetes C. difficile for its main energy source, primary bile acids produced by the host. This competitive exclusion enabled by an intact microbiome is described as colonization resistance. However, when there is community-level dysbiosis and competitors are eliminated, C. difficile, typically a poor competitor for bile acid metabolism, is able to overcome colonization resistance, resulting in infection. In addition to competing for resources, a healthy microbiome generates microbiome-derived secondary bile acids that inhibit residual C. difficile spores from germinating into their vegetative, toxin-producing form. Organisms that are able to convert primary bile acids into C. difficile-inhibiting secondary bile acids remove a food resource (primary bile acids) and create a potent inhibitor of toxin production (secondary bile acids). Antibiotics are able to suppress vegetative, toxin-producing C. difficile, but residual C. difficile spores are not susceptible to antibiotics and are able to persist. Accordingly, when an antibiotic course is complete, the residual C. difficile spores can germinate into vegetative, toxin-producing C. difficile, driving CDI recurrence, a key element of morbidity, mortality and cost in CDI care. Until the underlying microbiome dysbiosis is addressed, patients remain susceptible to CDI recurrence.

   Third-Party Clinical Data: Numerous cohort studies, observations from clinical practice and small randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that FMT is able to prevent recurrent CDI. CP101 builds on these human data that suggest repairing community-level dysbiosis may restore colonization resistance and break the cycle of CDI recurrence.
Existing Therapeutics and Their Limitations
Antibiotics

Although antibiotics are considered standard of care to treat CDI, they also impair the diversity of the resident microbiome, affording a potential microbial niche for resident C. difficile spores to germinate into toxin-producing cells. Recurrence rates following antibiotic therapy are high as these agents exacerbate community-level dysbiosis. A commonly used CDI antibiotic, vancomycin, is non-specific and causes significant disruption to the microbiome. New generation medications, such as fidaxomicin, were designed as an alternative, narrow-spectrum antibiotic, with reduced activity against other microbes compared to vancomycin. Increasingly sophisticated and precision-targeted antibiotics can mitigate further harm to the microbiome but they do not address what we believe to be the root cause of recurrent CDI—the dysbiosis caused by antimicrobials.
Antibodies

Bezlotoxumab is an approved intravenous monoclonal antibody product that targets the toxins produced by C. difficile. However, like antibiotic therapy, it fails to repair dysbiosis, the underlying cause of recurrent CDI.
Probiotics

Probiotics are dietary supplements or foods that contain microbes and are typically derived from fermented foods such as yogurt. However, probiotics are not designed to durably colonize the human intestine and no clinical trials have demonstrated durable repair of dysbiosis with probiotics to date. Recent ACG guidelines have recommended against the use of probiotics for the prevention of CDI.
 Fecal Microbiota Transplantation

FMT is the process of transplanting stool and accompanying microbes from healthy donors into patients suffering from diseases of dysbiosis. FMT has generated remarkable outcomes in CDI, supporting the rationale for targeting dysbiosis. However, FMT is a procedure, not a product, and often requires a colonoscopy for administration. There are no defined regulatory standards for screening, processing and delivery of FMT, and this treatment has not been approved by the FDA. There is no FDA-approved agent that addresses the community-level dysbiosis that underlies recurrent CDI.
Our Product Candidate: CP101

We have designed CP101 to break the cycle of CDI recurrence by restoring a complete microbiome. We believe that CP101 has the following advantages when compared to existing therapeutic approaches and other microbiome therapeutic candidates in development for the treatment of recurrent CDI:
•Differentiated manufacturing enables the delivery of a complete microbiome. Our manufacturing technology enables us to exclude pathogens through donor and stool screening, without destruction of the majority of the microbiome through non-specific biocides like ethanol. Besides enabling CP101 to address community-level dysbiosis, rather than a limited subset of the microbiome, we believe that creating a manufacturing process that moves beyond reliance on biocides enables higher yields and more efficient, less costly manufacturing. We believe these advantages will be particularly important as we evaluate CP101 in new indications where ethanol-sensitive organisms, which comprise the majority of the microbiome, are likely to play a critical role and scalable manufacturing will enable us to serve large markets. 
 •Novel class of therapy that addresses the underlying cause of disease by restoring the microbiome. While antibiotics are the current standard of care for the treatment of recurrent CDI, they fail to address the underlying community-level dysbiosis that causes recurrence of the disease. CP101 is designed to durably repair community-level dysbiosis, restoring colonization resistance and production of protective microbiome-derived secondary bile acids. Through its novel mechanism, CP101 also avoids contributing to antibiotic resistance. 
 •Achieved primary endpoint in a broad patient population. CP101 is the only orally administered, microbiome therapeutic candidate drug in development that achieved its primary endpoint in a pivotal trial that included 

   patients across all stages of recurrent CDI, including first recurrence, which represents more than half of all recurrent CDI episodes. PRISM3 included participants 65 years of age or older who were experiencing their first recurrence of CDI and PRISM-EXT included adults of all ages who were experiencing their first recurrence of CDI. Other drugs in development have focused on patients with multiple recurrences, rather than the more challenging hurdle of delivering meaningful clinical outcomes in front-line care for recurrent CDI. CP101 achieved its primary endpoint in a population that included patients diagnosed by either polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, testing or toxin enzyme immunoassay, or EIA, testing. Other drugs in development failed to demonstrate efficacy among patients diagnosed by PCR and have subsequently focused development exclusively on those diagnosed by toxin EIA. This is commercially important because PCR is the method used to diagnose more than 80% of all CDI cases each year in the United States. By incorporating patients with first recurrence and diagnosed by PCR testing into our study design, we expanded the addressable patient population more than 10-fold relative to products in development that were evaluated only in patients with multiple recurrences and diagnosed by toxin EIA testing. We believe based on the results of our PRISM3 trial, CP101 will have broad applicability across all stages of recurrent CDI and all methods of CDI diagnosis. Data from our PRISM-EXT trial also supports the use of CP101 as rescue therapy for patients who do not respond to a first dose of treatment.
 •Favorable tolerability profile with no treatment-related SAEs observed. In our PRISM3 trial, CP101 was observed to be well-tolerated, with a similar prevalence of adverse events across the CP101 and placebo arms and no treatment-related SAEs within the CP101 group. We believe this promising tolerability profile is enabled by our robust product and process design. 
 Market Opportunity

Recurrent CDI represents a robust market opportunity and we estimate there are approximately 200,000 cases each year in the United States. As shown in the figure below, the first recurrence of CDI represents more than half of these cases. Unlike pivotal trials for other microbiome programs, the PRISM3 trial design included first recurrence CDI for patients 65 years of age or older, demonstrating benefit in a broad patient population.
   

We expect that prescriptions of CP101 will be predominantly fulfilled in the outpatient setting, through the specialty pharmacy channel. While initial presentation of recurrent CDI may occur either in the hospital setting or in the outpatient setting, the majority of hospitalized patients are discharged while being treated with standard-of-care antibiotics, prior to when CP101 would be administered. We believe that this outpatient setting, which provides favorable pricing and reimbursement dynamics relative to the hospital setting, will allow us to better realize value in the recurrent CDI market opportunity.
Clinical Trials of CP101 for the Treatment of Recurrent CDI
Overview
 The development of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI is supported by positive topline results from a Phase 1 open-label clinical trial (n=49), a Phase 2 placebo-controlled clinical trial referred to as the PRISM3 trial (n=198), and a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial referred to as the PRISM-EXT trial (n=132), as further summarized elsewhere in this Annual Report. CP101 is currently in late-stage clinical development and being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as the
   PRISM4 trial, anticipated to enroll approximately 300 participants. We plan to have further discussions with the FDA regarding the size and make-up of the safety database for CP101, which could result in the need for additional studies. PRISM4 is currently on clinical hold, pending product availability and resolution of matters related to the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter and the March 2022 Letter. PRISM4 Trial
We have designed a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the PRISM4 trial, to serve as our second pivotal trial of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI. The PRISM4 trial is a multi-center trial expected to enroll approximately 300 adult participants with recurrent CDI. PRISM4 has two parts: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled part (Part A) and an optional, open-label treatment part (Part B). In Part A, eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a one-time oral administration of CP101 or placebo after completing standard-of-care, or SOC, CDI antibiotics for their most recent CDI recurrence. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be CDI recurrence through 8 weeks post-treatment. The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events through week 8. Secondary endpoints include safety and CDI recurrence through 24 weeks post-treatment. The design of Part A is shown below.
PRISM4 Part A Trial Design
 



Like our previously completed PRISM3 Phase 2 clinical trial, the PRISM4 trial will enroll participants with recurrent CDI, including participants experiencing their first CDI recurrence that are 65 years of age or older. At study entry, all guideline recommended test methods for C. difficile, including PCR- or toxin EIA-based test methods, will be accepted for the diagnosis of the qualifying episode of CDI.

Participants in Part A of the PRISM4 trial that experience a CDI recurrence within 8 weeks of randomization will have the option to enroll in the open-label, Part B component of the trial, in which they will receive CP101 following completion of SOC antibiotics.
 
On March 1, 2022, we announced that enrollment in PRISM4 was paused following receipt of the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter. We have submitted a Complete Response to the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter and we are communicating with the FDA to resolve the clinical hold and related matters, as described above in the section entitled "Clinical Hold".

PRISM3 Trial

We evaluated CP101 for the treatment of recurrent CDI in our pivotal PRISM3 trial, which represents the first positive pivotal trial with an orally administered complete microbiome product candidate. PRISM3 was a Phase 2, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial designed to demonstrate the superiority of CP101 following standard-of-care CDI antibiotics compared to antibiotics alone in preventing recurrence among patients with recurrent CDI. A total of 206 participants were enrolled across 51 sites, of which 198 were evaluable. Patients were recruited from across all stages of recurrent CDI, including patients experiencing their first recurrence that were 65 years of age or older. Qualifying episodes of recurrent CDI were diagnosed using all standard-of-care laboratory tests, including PCR- or toxin EIA-based test methods. All participants were treated with standard-of-care CDI antibiotic therapy prior to randomization. Following antibiotic treatment, participants were randomized to receive either a one-time oral administration of CP101 or a placebo, without the need for bowel preparation. The trial design is shown below.
   PRISM3 Trial Design
   

Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two study arms, with no meaningful clinical differences. Participants with a first CDI recurrence at study entry represented approximately 30% of the study population.
Treatment Groups Had No Meaningful Clinical Differences at Baseline
   

PRISM3 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint, which was sustained clinical cure defined as the absence of CDI recurrence through eight weeks following administration of study drug. Sustained clinical cure was determined by a blinded adjudication board of independent experts evaluating the totality of clinical and laboratory data including central laboratory data with PCR, toxin EIA and toxigenic culture testing. Following standard-of-care CDI antibiotics, 74.5% of participants treated with CP101 achieved sustained clinical cure, a statistically significant improvement over those receiving placebo (61.5%; p=0.0488), meeting the primary efficacy endpoint and representing a clinically meaningful 33.8% relative risk reduction for CDI recurrence, as shown below on the left. On long-term assessment, CP101 demonstrated clinically meaningful durability and the proportion of participants with sustained clinical cure, defined as the absence of CDI recurrence, through Week 24 remained significantly higher in the CP101 arm compared to placebo (73.5% [75/102] vs 59.4% [57/96], p=0.0347). Time-to-event analysis through Week 24 showed a statistically significant and durable benefit, favoring CP101 compared to placebo (p=0.018), as shown below on the right.

PRISM3 Extension Trial

PRISM-EXT was an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of CP101 for the prevention of recurrent CDI. Initially, the study only enrolled participants who had previously enrolled in the randomized, placebo-controlled PRISM3 trial and experienced a CDI recurrence. After PRISM3 enrollment was complete, a protocol amendment expanded the inclusion criteria to allow participants with recurrent CDI to enroll directly in PRISM-EXT without having previously enrolled in PRISM3. The trial design is shown below.
 PRISM3 Extension Trial Design
   

In November 2021, we reported positive topline results from the PRISM-EXT trial. A total of 132 participants were analyzed, including one cohort that directly enrolled in the trial following a recent CDI recurrence without having previously participated in PRISM3 (n=82) and one cohort that enrolled after experiencing a CDI recurrence following administration of placebo or a single dose of CP101 in PRISM3 (n=50). The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained clinical cure (defined as absence of CDI recurrence) through 8 weeks post-treatment. Overall, 80.3% of participants who received a single oral administration of CP101 following standard-of-care antibiotics in PRISM-EXT achieved sustained clinical cure (defined as absence of CDI recurrence) through week 8 and 78.8% had sustained clinical cure through week 24, as shown below. The PRISM-EXT results are consistent with and build on the previously reported PRISM3 results.
   CP101 Demonstrated Robust Sustained Clinical Cure in PRISM-EXT
 

Among the 102 participants who were treated with CP101 in PRISM3, 20 were enrolled in PRISM-EXT and treated with a second dose of CP101. Of the participants who received either a single dose of CP101 in PRISM3 (n=82) or a second dose by enrolling in PRISM-EXT (n=20), a post-hoc analysis shows that a total of 90 participants achieved sustained clinical cure through 8 weeks after their final dose, resulting in a cumulative efficacy of 88.2% (n=102).
 Phase 1 Clinical Trials

The first clinical trial to evaluate CP101 for the treatment of recurrent CDI was a 49 patient, single-center, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial conducted at the University of Minnesota. The trial enrolled patients who had experienced two or more recurrences of CDI. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of CP101. Clinical success was defined as absence of CDI recurrence within two months post-treatment. No related SAEs occurred and 43 of the 49 patients treated achieved clinical success, resulting in an efficacy rate of 87.8% after treatment with CP101. Because the study was designed with a single arm and did not have concurrent control participants, the statistical significance of the observed efficacy rate was not assessed in this study. Approximately a third of patients reported mild, transient gastrointestinal symptoms following the treatment. Multiple doses were evaluated in this first cohort, including a high dose range (1.25-2.5x1012) and a low dose range (2.1-2.5x1011), with no meaningful dose response at the dosing levels tested. An intermediate dose of 6x1011 was selected for further process development and tested in an additional 10-patient cohort at the University of Minnesota. In this second cohort, seven of ten patients achieved clinical success through eight weeks following CP101. These promising clinical results from Phase 1 were used to secure Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.
Safety and Tolerability

CP101 has been well-tolerated throughout all stages of development to date, and there have been no treatment-related SAEs reported. In the PRISM3 safety population, treatment-emergent AEs and treatment-related AEs were similar between treatment groups, with 16.3% (17/104) of participants in the CP101 arm versus 19.2% (19/99) of participants in the placebo arm experiencing treatment-related adverse events, or AEs, through 24 weeks. In the CP101 arm, treatment-related AEs were mild (Grade 1: 16/17) and moderate (Grade 2: 1/17), and primarily gastrointestinal in nature.
 
The most common treatment-emergent AEs reported in the CP101 arm through week 8 were predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, as shown in the table below. Among the five most common adverse events in the CP101 arm, four adverse events were observed more frequently in participants treated with placebo relative to participants treated with CP101. For instance, we observed significantly fewer participants with abdominal pain among those treated with CP101 (30.8%) relative to those treated with placebo (59.6%; p<0.0001).
   Most Frequent Adverse Events in the PRISM3 CP101 Arm Through Week 8
   

Additionally, in the 132-participant PRISM-EXT trial, there were no treatment-related SAEs reported and CP101 exhibited an overall safety profile consistent with the profile observed in PRISM3.
Pharmacokinetics

We used data from these clinical trials to confirm potential mechanisms underlying the clinical outcomes observed with CP101 for recurrent CDI. We used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the engraftment of CP101 Taxa, or groups of genetically similar bacteria, among participants treated in the PRISM3 study. As expected, participants treated with CP101 had dramatically higher engraftment of CP101 Taxa than patients treated with placebo, as shown in the graphic below, highlighting our ability to effectively deliver a viable consortia to the appropriate location in the gastrointestinal tract with our targeted oral capsule.

CP101 Shows Significant Engraftment Overall

 
We also observed a strong relationship between engraftment of the microbes delivered in CP101 and clinical outcomes in PRISM3. Among patients with successful engraftment at week 1 following CP101 administration, 96.0% achieved a sustained clinical cure, while 54.2% of those without successful engraftment at week 1 achieved a sustained clinical cure (p < 0.001).
      
CP101 EngraftmentShows a Bimodal Distribution | CP101 Engraftment Correlates with Sustained Clinical Cure

 
We believe one factor that may have reduced engraftment among some PRISM3 participants who received CP101 is the persistence of residual vancomycin, a broad spectrum antibiotic with activity against a number of CP101 microbes, prior to treatment with CP101. As part of the study protocol, all patients enrolled in PRISM3 completed a course of standard of care antibiotics, which could have included either vancomycin or fidaxomicin, prior to randomization and administration of study drug.

To limit the impact of residual standard of care antibiotics on CP101, participants in PRISM3 completed a minimum two-day antibiotic washout period prior to administration of study drug to provide time for antibiotic clearance from the colon. Recent scientific literature shows, however, that the stool concentration of vancomycin two days after cessation of administration remains at approximately 65% of peak concentrations and declines to approximately 15% of peak concentrations after a three-day washout. These data suggest that a two-day washout period may have been insufficient to clear residual vancomycin.

To address this limitation, we have extended the minimum antibiotic washout period prior to administration of CP101 in our PRISM4 trial from two days to four days.
Pharmacodynamics

We believe bile acid metabolism plays a key role in the pathogenesis of recurrent CDI. A healthy microbiome generates microbiome-derived secondary bile acids that inhibit residual C. difficile spores from germinating into their vegetative toxin-producing form. Patients with recurrent CDI have depleted secondary bile acids and a higher concentration of primary bile acids, a key energy source for C. difficile. There are eight microbial genes that are critical for the conversion of primary bile acids into secondary bile acids. We used high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to measure the presence of these genes before and after treatment with CP101. At baseline, we found participants with recurrent CDI had between zero and four of these genes, missing key components of the pathway. Among participants evaluated for pharmacodynamics in Phase 1 (n=5), we found that all participants had all eight genes at all timepoints measured after treatment with CP101, highlighting the ability of CP101 to restore an important pathway in the pathogenesis of recurrent CDI.

These data show that in keeping with similar host-targeted gene therapies, we are able to deliver a lasting transformation in the genetic capacity of the treated patient in a manner that improves clinical outcomes. With our treatment, however, we do not need to modify the host genome, instead we can deliver these genetic capabilities through microbes that are able to engraft and reproduce in the host. Importantly, because more than 99% of all genes found in humans are found in the microbiome, this opens a much broader suite of targets than those which are accessible through host-targeted gene therapies.

Chronic HBV

Following a strategic review of our pipeline and business, we announced in March 2022 the decision to pause the development of CP101 for the treatment of chronic HBV. We believe this decision will allow us to maximize our working capital available for investment in our wholly-owned recurrent CDI and ASD programs. We continue to believe that CP101, or other product candidates that we may develop in the future, may have the potential to treat chronic HBV, a chronic infection linked to microbiome dysbiosis. We may continue our research efforts in HBV in the future as our portfolio continues to mature.
 FIN-211 to Address Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder
Overview

FIN-211 is an orally administered, Enriched Consortia product candidate designed to deliver both a complete microbiome and targeted microbes not found in most healthy donors. We believe FIN-211 has the ability to address both the gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD.
Indication Overview

ASD is a behaviorally defined condition characterized by reduced social interaction, impaired communication skills and the presence of repetitive or restrictive behaviors. Beyond the core symptoms by which it is defined, ASD is recognized as a heterogeneous medical condition by the FDA, and patients can exhibit highly varied symptoms and behaviors such as irritability, heightened sensitivities and movement disorders. A subset of patients with ASD, comprising at least 30% of the
   population, experience significant gastrointestinal symptoms, with the most common gastrointestinal symptom being constipation (ASD-C). There is a correlation between the severity of these gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of behavioral symptoms. Standard treatments for constipation are often ineffective, which may be because the underlying biology of gastrointestinal symptoms is distinct in children with ASD compared to neurotypical children. We believe by addressing this underlying biology with a microbiome therapeutic, we will be able to improve ASD gastrointestinal symptom and neurobehavioral development.

The diagnosed prevalence of ASD is currently 1 in 44 for children in the United States, a prevalence that has increased substantially over the past few decades. Worldwide prevalence estimates vary but are thought to be similar in other developed countries. It is believed there are more than 4.6 million children and adults in the United States with ASD. By some estimates, the total financial burden of care for patients with ASD exceeds $100 billion in the United States annually.
Existing Therapeutics and Their Limitations

There is no FDA-approved pharmaceutical treatment for the core symptoms of ASD. The only widely accepted intervention with substantial supportive evidence is a form of long-term behavioral therapy, called Applied Behavioral Analysis, or ABA. Children with ASD usually begin ABA as soon as they are diagnosed, typically between ages 2-6 years, and are recommended to receive 30-40 hours of therapy every week. ABA may continue into adulthood and parents are often faced with making difficult choices between school or continuing ABA therapy. The only FDA-approved pharmaceutical treatment for ASD are anti-psychotics, which are only prescribed to treat the irritability that often accompanies ASD, but is not a core symptom of the disorder. While ASD-C may be treated with laxatives or enemas, these can be poorly tolerated and are often ineffective. As a result, a high unmet medical need remains across both gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms.
Rationale for Microbiome Therapeutics in ASD

Dysbiosis: Microbiome signals, epidemiological risk factors and gut symptoms all suggest a link between ASD and the microbiome. ASD is frequently accompanied by severe gastrointestinal manifestations, revealing symptoms more proximal to the activities of the gut microbiome. Moreover, the risk of developing ASD is significantly increased among children born by caesarean section or those exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics early in life. Mouse studies have demonstrated the ability to transfer ASD-like symptoms by transferring stool from humans with ASD. Conversely, certain ASD-mouse models have shown that ASD-like symptoms can be reduced by microbiome transfer from a neurotypical donor.

Mechanism of Action: Once considered a strictly neurological condition, the modern view of ASD has evolved to encompass multiple systems, including interactions between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome, also called the gut-brain axis. Many well-known neuro-active signaling molecules such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, serotonin and oxytocin are either produced or modulated by the microbiome, which has led to efforts to better understand the role of the microbiome across a range of behavioral and neurological conditions, including ASD. Current research highlights several pathways in the gut-brain axis that may be key to ASD. Neuro-active metabolites that are exclusively produced by the microbiome, such as 4-ethylphenylsulfate, or 4EPS, are significantly elevated among children with ASD relative to neurotypical controls, and are capable of inducing ASD-like symptoms in mice. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide responsible for regulating social bonding and behavior, has long been a target for drug development in ASD, but exogenous agonism of oxytocin has been challenging due to a short half-life of oxytocin. Certain microbes can induce endogenous production of oxytocin, providing an alternative means to engage this important pathway. Preclinical work has demonstrated that introduction of oxytocin-inducing bacteria can restore neurotypical behavior in three independent ASD murine models. This rescue is dependent on the vagus nerve which connects the enteric nervous system in the gut with the central nervous system and was eliminated when the gene for the oxytocin receptor was knocked out. This pathway-level dysbiosis and previously described community-level dysbiosis suggest the potential role for an Enriched Consortia product strategy.

Third-Party Clinical Data: At least five investigator-sponsored clinical studies have found that the restoration of a healthy microbiome by FMT is associated with marked improvements in behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms among children with ASD. An open-label proof-of-concept trial administering FMT for 8 weeks reported that, two years after treatment, most participants reported gastrointestinal symptoms remaining improved compared to baseline and 44% of study participants who had previously been diagnosed with ASD fell below the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score cut-off used to classify autism. Even using a more stringent CARS score cut-off of 25, we find that 33% of participants no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD, as shown in the below graph. Additionally, in a randomized, controlled trial, children with ASD receiving FMT and behavioral therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in their behavioral symptoms compared to the control group receiving behavioral therapy alone.
   Behavioral Scores Improved Dramatically Over Two Years in an Open-Label,
Proof-of-Concept FMT Trial
   
Our Product Candidate: FIN-211

FIN-211 is an orally administered, Enriched Consortia product candidate designed to deliver both a complete microbiome and targeted microbes not found in most healthy donors. Based on our understanding of the biology of ASD, we have identified species capable of inducing oxytocin production and improving gastrointestinal barrier function. We believe these organisms may have important therapeutic benefits for individuals with ASD. These organisms are not ubiquitous in healthy donors, so our Complete Consortia product strategy would not generally include these microbes. Accordingly, we have decided to pursue an Enriched Consortia product strategy that includes both strains targeting oxytocin-production and a complete microbiome to address community-level dysbiosis, which we believe best positions FIN-211 to potentially address both the gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms of ASD.
Clinical Development of FIN-211 to Address Symptoms of ASD

We are preparing to initiate a Phase 1b clinical trial, which we refer to as AUSPIRE, of FIN-211 in children with ASD (ages 5–17 years) with constipation. Although FIN-211 is not directly addressed in the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter, it is an Enriched Consortia product candidate that includes donor-derived components. Because the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter is concerned with SARS-CoV-2 screening measures for donor-derived microbiota material, the clinical hold will delay initiation of AUSPIRE and will require us to conduct additional manufacturing activities (including manufacturing additional components of FIN-211) in order to satisfy the FDA's requests related to SARS-CoV-2 screening and testing. We have submitted a Complete Response to the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter and we are communicating with the FDA to resolve the clinical hold as soon as possible. We are evaluating the extent of the delay the clinical hold and the related manufacturing activities will have on the expected timing of AUSPIRE; based on manufacturing timelines, we expect at least a one-quarter delay.
 
Based on clinical FMT data and preclinical data with oxytocin-inducing strains, we believe FIN-211 is positioned to address both the gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms of ASD. The FDA has indicated that either gastrointestinal or behavioral endpoints could support a biologics license application and we are evaluating both gastrointestinal and behavioral endpoints. Given the absence of FDA-approved therapies and building on our discussions with the FDA, we aim to continue to validate behavioral instruments as part of our clinical development plans. We believe FIN-211 can potentially address adults with ASD as well as both adults and children without gastrointestinal symptoms, expanding beyond our initial population of pediatrics with gastrointestinal symptoms where we expect to observe an enriched signal.
 
We believe this development strategy represents an attractive entry into the gut-brain axis, providing two opportunities to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with ASD, both for behavioral symptoms and lower-risk gastrointestinal endpoints. Furthermore, we believe that ASD could validate our microbiome-based approach to addressing additional gut-brain axis indications. We plan to leverage existing and emerging clinical data from our academic collaborators to inform the development strategy of future product candidates to address additional neurological disorders that are associated with the gut-brain axis.
   TAK-524 (Ulcerative Colitis) & FIN-525 (Crohn’s Disease) for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Overview

TAK-524 (formerly known as FIN-524) and FIN-525 are each orally administered Targeted Consortia product candidates designed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (TAK-524) and Crohn’s disease (FIN-525). We initially partnered with Takeda, a global leader in inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, to develop TAK-524. TAK-524 comprises targeted strains identified by our Human-First Discovery platform, which do not require donors. Following the achievement of certain preclinical milestones in the development of TAK-524 for ulcerative colitis, we expanded our development partnership with Takeda to include FIN-525, a program to develop a live biotherapeutic product optimized for Crohn’s disease that also comprises targeted strains identified by our Human-First Discovery platform. In August 2021, Takeda accelerated its leadership role in TAK-524, taking responsibility for clinical development, while we continue to conduct discovery efforts on FIN-525. We believe that the development programs for TAK-524 and FIN-525, which are Targeted Consortia product candidates composed of strains grown from master cell banks, are not affected by the February 2022 Clinical Hold Letter.
 Indication Overview

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are the two principal sub-types of IBD. IBD comprises a set of heterogeneous autoimmune conditions that cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of IBD include severe, chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding and weight loss. Patients have substantially higher risk of colon cancer, gastrointestinal perforations and infections, and many eventually require surgical resection of portions of their gastrointestinal tract or colectomy. Patients undergo periods of active disease (flares) accompanied by intermittent periods of little or no disease activity (remission). Over 3 million Americans and 10 million people globally are thought to suffer from IBD, and the incidence has increased rapidly over the past few decades. By some estimates, the total financial burden of care for patients with IBD exceeds $31 billion in the United States annually.
Existing Therapeutics and Their Limitations

The current treatment options vary by disease types and severity, and are designed to reduce inflammation, but do not address the underlying cause of disease. Active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis is often treated with 5-ASA agents. However, over 70% of patients fail to enter remission. Active mild-moderate Crohn’s disease have limited therapeutic options. Corticosteroids are commonly used in active disease; however, the long-term side effect profile is poor and includes increased risk of infections, type 2 diabetes, weight gain, mood disturbances and hypertension. Biologic agents that suppress inflammatory cytokines or cell trafficking are not typically orally administered agents, and have poor rates of inducing remission. There is a single, recently approved oral biologic for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease; however, similar to other biologics, it is associated with increased risk for severe infections, blood clots and the development of malignancy. Commonly used anti-TNF biologic agents may lead to serious infections due to immunosuppression, and there have been reports of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of lymphoma that is fatal in some patients.

Overall, current treatments for IBD fail to address the underlying causes of inflammation, and there is a significant need for well-tolerated, easily administered, disease-modifying agents in IBD.
Rationale for Microbiome Therapeutics in IBD

Dysbiosis: Over the last decade, a number of lines of evidence have pointed to the promise of microbiome therapeutics in treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Inflammatory bowel disease is one of the suite of chronic inflammatory diseases that has risen dramatically in prevalence in developed nations marked by gastrointestinal dysbiosis.

Mechanism of Action: Extensive preclinical work has demonstrated the criticality of the microbiome, including specific microbial metabolites, in regulating gastrointestinal tract inflammation, predicting response to therapy and determining the risk of disease recurrence after surgery. The improvement of gut barrier integrity, reduction of local immune activation and modulation of gut inflammation are all modulated by the microbiome.

Third-Party Clinical Data: FMT studies in IBD were key in our decision to develop Targeted Consortia product candidates for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Data from over 40 FMT studies, including five randomized, placebo-controlled trials in ulcerative colitis and one randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Crohn’s disease, have shown promising clinical outcomes. Some of these interventional studies also served as our main discovery datasets to select which strains and functions to include in our Targeted Consortia approach for IBD. Clinical studies with only spore-forming compositions have
   yielded mixed results, highlighting the value of our approach, which leverages both spore-forming and non-spore forming compositions.
 TAK-524 and FIN-525

TAK-524 is a Targeted Consortia product candidate of nine bacterial strains selected for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and is orally administered in a lyophilized formulation. We designed this consortium to target three specific modes of action: two classes of immunoregulatory metabolites, each targeting a different set of host pathways, and donor strains linked to remission following FMT in patients with ulcerative colitis. Takeda now leads development of TAK-524.
 
FIN-525 is a discovery-stage program designing a Targeted Consortia product candidate for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. The strategy for this consortium, which is differentiated from ulcerative colitis, includes donor strains depleted in Crohn’s patients and linked to remission following FMT in these patients, as well as several classes of metabolites, each targeting a different set of host pathways.
 
TAK-524 and FIN-525 leverage data collected from over two dozen cohorts comprising over 2,300 patients, including six FMT studies in ulcerative colitis and five in Crohn’s disease. Our machine learning platform identified microbes and microbial functions deficient in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease compared to non-IBD controls. We tested these hypotheses with FMT data to identify the subset most likely to be causal, focusing on organisms consistently shown to be enriched among successful FMTs and subjects without IBD. To reduce the translational risk of these empirical signals, we isolated target organisms directly from specific donor samples that induced remission in clinical studies of FMT in IBD. In vitro and in vivo measurements on the isolated strains and consortia then confirmed the signals of biological activity hypothesized by our machine learning platform. We are currently conducting discovery efforts on FIN-525.

Selecting a strain associated with positive FMT outcomes starts with machine learning models of clinical data. For TAK-524, an analysis of data from over 1000 patients was used to quantify the relationship between each clade of bacteria (each represented as a dot) and ulcerative colitis. On the x-axis, the degree to which each clade is depleted from a patient’s microbiome relative to healthy controls is shown. On the y-axis, the impact of each clade in driving remission when added to a patient’s microbiome by FMT is shown. Colors indicate the higher-level phylogenetic group each dot is assigned to. The bacterial clades with the greatest effect (top right quadrant) are the targets we isolated for in-vitro validation.

In January 2017, we entered into an agreement, or the Takeda Agreement, with Takeda, pursuant to which we granted Takeda a worldwide, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under our rights in certain patents, patent applications and know-how to develop, have developed, manufacture, have manufactured, make, have made, use, have used, offer for sale, sell, have sold, commercialize, have commercialized and import our microbiome therapeutic candidate TAK-524 for the prevention, diagnosis, theragnosis or treatment of diseases in humans. We subsequently amended and restated the Takeda Agreement in October 2019 to provide a worldwide, exclusive license to a second microbiome therapeutic candidate, FIN-525. We further amended the Takeda Agreement in August 2021 to transition primary responsibility for further development and manufacturing activities of TAK-524 to Takeda in accordance with a transition plan, and Takeda assumed sole responsibility for regulatory matters with respect to TAK-524. In November 2021, we further amended the Takeda Agreement to enable us to carry out certain FIN-525 preliminary evaluation activities.
 
   Under the terms of the Takeda Agreement, we agreed to design TAK-524 (a product candidate optimized for ulcerative colitis) for Takeda based on selection criteria within a product-specific development plan. We also agreed to conduct feasibility studies on FIN-525 (a program to develop a live biotherapeutic product optimized for Crohn’s disease) for Takeda, and Takeda can determine whether to initiate a full product-specific development plan for FIN-525 following its review of the data from our feasibility studies. The FIN-525 feasibility study was completed in March 2021. Takeda is to select one optimal microbial cocktail for each of TAK-524 and FIN-525 after completion of certain initial product development activities. Thereafter, prior to initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for TAK-524 or FIN-525, as applicable, Takeda has the right to substitute the initially selected microbial cocktail for another microbial cocktail selected by Takeda from certain alternative cocktails that were designated by Takeda at the time of selecting the initial microbial cocktail.

Pursuant to the Takeda Agreement, we are primarily responsible for early-stage development activities for FIN-525 pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget, including potentially through Phase 2 clinical trials, subject to Takeda’s right to either co-develop a product with us at Phase 2 or assume responsibility for such development. After the successful completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial for FIN-525, Takeda will assume primary responsibility for the Phase 3 clinical program. Initially, we are responsible for clinical supply of FIN-525; however, Takeda is required to assume responsibility for such manufacture and supply no later than six months after completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial for the first FIN-525 product candidate. All such development and manufacturing activities will be overseen by certain joint committees. Pursuant to the August 2021 amendment to the Takeda Agreement, Takeda assumed primary responsibility for early-stage development and manufacturing activities with respect to TAK-524. Takeda also assumed sole responsibility for regulatory matters with respect to TAK-524. We remain responsible for certain development activities designated in the TAK-524 development plan, for which we will continue to receive reimbursement from Takeda.
 
Takeda is responsible for up to 110% of our budgeted full-time equivalent costs in connection with our development activities for TAK-524 (and FIN-525, if Takeda elects to initiate a full development plan for FIN-525) as well as all costs related to chemistry, manufacturing and control development or other development costs incurred after the initial selection of an optimal microbial cocktail. Takeda is solely responsible for all commercial activities related to the TAK-524 and FIN-525 product candidates, at its cost.

We have agreed that prior to completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial for the first TAK-524 product candidate being developed with the intention of seeking U.S. regulatory approval, other than as part of any development activities under the Takeda Agreement, we shall not engage in any research and development directed toward any product candidate for the treatment of IBD, or access or use certain fecal microbiota source material or any data generated from that material in IBD for any purpose. Additionally, we have agreed that prior to completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial for the first FIN-525 product candidate being developed with the intention of seeking U.S. regulatory approval, other than as part of any development activities under the Takeda Agreement, we shall not engage in any research and development directed toward any product for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, or access or use certain fecal microbiota source material or any data generated from that material in Crohn’s disease for any purpose. We have also agreed for the remainder of the term of the Takeda Agreement to certain restrictions on our access or use of certain bacterial strains having at least a threshold genetic relatedness to the strains incorporated into TAK-524 or FIN-525, our access or use of certain fecal microbiota source material, and our ability to conduct certain research and development directed toward products for the treatment of IBD and Crohn’s disease that contain bacterial strains having less than a threshold genetic divergence from the bacterial strains in TAK-524 and FIN-525, respectively.

Pursuant to the Takeda Agreement, we granted Takeda a right of first offer in the event that we seek to commence a program for the treatment of IBD, as well as an exclusive option to negotiate that the parties undertake an additional development program for a microbial composition.
   In connection with entry into the Takeda Agreement, we received a one-time, upfront payment from Takeda in the amount of $10.0 million. Additionally, we received $4.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of certain development milestones for TAK-524 therapeutic products and are entitled to receive up to $176.0 million in the aggregate, for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sale milestones for TAK-524 therapeutic products. We are entitled to receive up to $177.7 million in the aggregate, for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sale milestones for FIN-525 therapeutic products, subject, to certain specified reductions based upon the nature of the FIN-525 product and certain additional milestones to be negotiated by the parties. We are also entitled to receive up to $10.0 million for the first diagnostic product for each of TAK-524 and FIN-525, subject to certain reductions in the event that Takeda uses a third party to develop such diagnostic products. Pursuant to this agreement, Takeda is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales of TAK-524 and FIN-525 products ranging from mid to high-single digits, subject to certain reductions. Such royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, during the period beginning on the date of first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later to occur of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid
   claim of any patents or patent applications controlled by us and licensed in such country that covers the composition of matter of such product, the date that regulatory exclusivity of such product expires in such country, or eight years from the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.

The Takeda Agreement expires on the date of expiration of the last royalty payment obligation. Either party may terminate the Takeda Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Takeda has the right to terminate the Takeda Agreement, in whole or in party, on a program-by-program basis upon specified notice to us or immediately following the withdrawal of a product from any market as a result of bona fide concerns based on specific and verifiable information that such product is unsafe for administration to humans. Additionally, the parties may mutually agree to terminate the Takeda Agreement on a program-by-program basis.
Exclusive License Agreement with Arizona State University

In July 2017, we entered into a license agreement, or the Arizona State Agreement, with Skysong Innovations LLC (formerly Arizona Science and Technology Enterprises LLC), or Skysong, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patents and patent applications of Arizona State University to make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold, offer to sell, have offered for sale, import, have imported, export or have exported products and services that are covered by such licensed patents. In July 2018, we subsequently amended the Arizona State Agreement to include certain additional patents and patent applications of Arizona State University. The patents and patent applications that we have exclusively licensed from Arizona State University under the Arizona State Agreement relate generally to compositions and methods to treat autism spectrum disorder and related symptoms and comorbidities. If issued, the patents within the licensed intellectual property would be expected to expire beginning in 2033.

Pursuant to the terms of the Arizona State Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development and commercialization of products and services, the manufacture, use, sale, offering for sale, importation or exportation of which, but for the license granted under the Arizona State Agreement, would infringe one or more licensed patents, or licensed products. Such efforts are limited to the United States and include a specific performance milestone.

Under the terms of the Arizona State Agreement, we paid Skysong an upfront fee of $10,000 and reimbursed Skysong for prior patent prosecution expenses. Additionally, we have agreed to make a low-six digits milestone payment upon the first commercial sale of a product in each of the United States, England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, and a one-time commercial milestone payment in the low-seven digits upon the achievement of cumulative, worldwide net sales of all licensed products by us, our sublicensees or respective affiliates in the low-nine digits. We are also obligated to pay Skysong a low-single digit royalty on net sales of licensed products, including a minimum annual royalty payment in the mid-four digits to low-five digits that is creditable against the royalties due in such year. The royalty obligations continue on a country-by-country basis as to each licensed product until expiry of the last to expire claim within the licensed patents that covers such licensed product in such country. Moreover, we are obligated to pay a percentage of any non-royalty consideration received by us from a sublicensee in the high-second decile.

The Arizona State Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations. Upon expiration of our royalty obligations with respect to a licensed product in a country we will have a royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license to such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the Arizona State Agreement earlier for any reason or upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by Skysong. Skysong may terminate the Arizona State Agreement earlier upon our uncured material breach of the agreement, our insolvency, our initiation of any proceeding or claim challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent, or our failure to meet a specific performance milestone.
Exclusive Patent License Agreement with University of Minnesota

In March 2012, CIPAC Limited, an entity under the laws of Malta, or CIPAC, entered into a license agreement, or the UMN Agreement, with Regents of the University of Minnesota, or UMN, pursuant to which CIPAC obtained a worldwide, royalty-bearing, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patents and inventions of the University of Minnesota to make, have made, use, offer to sell or sell, offer to lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or dispose of any product or service that is covered by such licensed patents. The UMN Agreement was subsequently amended in June 2014 and October 2014. In May 2015, CIPAC transferred its interest in the UMN Agreement to us. Subsequent to such transfer, the UMN Agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016 and September 2017. We amended and
   restated the UMN Agreement in January 2022, to consolidate earlier amendments and extend the deadline for satisfying performance milestones by one year.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the UMN Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed inventions and to manufacture and sell licensed products, including by meeting certain specific performance milestones.

Under the terms of the UMN Agreement, we paid UMN an aggregate upfront fee of $155,000, and are obligated to pay annual maintenance fees in the mid-four digits. We are also obligated to pay UMN a royalty on net sales of licensed products ranging in the low-single digits depending on which licensed patents cover such licensed product, subject to a minimum annual royalty payment escalating over time in the low-five digits to low-six digits payable at the end of each applicable year. Such minimum annual royalty payments begin in 2021. The royalty obligations continue on a country-by-country basis as to each licensed product until expiry of the last to expire claim within the licensed patents that covers such licensed product in such country. Moreover, we are obligated to pay a percentage of any non-royalty consideration received by us from a sublicensee in the high-second decile.

The UMN Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all claims under the licensed patents. We may terminate the UMN Agreement earlier upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by UMN. UMN may terminate the UMN Agreement earlier upon our uncured material breach of the agreement, our insolvency, or upon the commencement by us of any proceeding asserting or alleging the invalidity or unenforceability of the licensed patents.
Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the field of microbiome therapeutics, are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide.

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing microbiome therapeutics in various indications. For CP101, we are aware that Seres Therapeutics, Inc. and Rebiotix Inc. each have a product candidate that has completed Phase 3 trials for recurrent CDI and are pursuing FDA approval to enable subsequent commercialization. In November 2021, Rebiotix filed a BLA for RBX-2660, their lead product in recurrent CDI, and Seres has indicated that they plan to file a BLA in 2022. In addition to these late-stage competitors, we are also aware of competitive microbiome therapies in earlier stages of clinical development, including VE303 (Vedanta Biosciences), NCTD-M3 (Destiny Pharma plc), MET-2 (NuBiyota), and RBX7455 (Rebiotix). Any advances in microbiome therapies made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates.

We are aware of a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as smaller, early-stage companies, that are pursuing the development of products and disease indications we are targeting. These companies include AbbVie Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., UCB S.A. and Vir Biotechnology, Inc. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others may be based on entirely different approaches.

Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.

   The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than us, which might result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than us. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Intellectual Property

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We file new patent applications as we conduct research and development, initiate new programs, and monitor the activities of others within the microbiome field. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent may be challenged in courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or at all, whether the claims of any patent applications, should they issue, will cover our product candidates, or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage.

Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter.

Our patent portfolio leverages both offensive and defensive strategies to protect our business. We have a large and diverse patent portfolio consisting of more than 55 issued U.S. and foreign patents and more than 140 pending patent applications that we own or exclusively license from others. Our patent portfolio has broad applicability across the microbiome field, and provides protection for our lead product candidates CP101, FIN-211, TAK-524, FIN-525, as well as additional Complete, Enriched and Targeted Consortia product candidates that we may develop. For CP101 specifically, our patent portfolio includes more than ten U.S. patents that cover CP101 and methods of use and manufacture. These patents have expiration dates between 2031 and 2037.
Foundational Protection for Multiple Product Candidates

Many of our broadest patents and patent applications originate from patent families that embody pioneering work in the microbiome by Dr. Thomas Borody, a prolific inventor and founder of the Centre for Digestive Diseases in Australia, and Drs. Alexander Khoruts and Michael Sadowsky at the University of Minnesota. These patent families have priority dates that precede the entry into the microbiome field by many of our competitors. As a result, we have been successful in obtaining broad patent coverage from these patent families over the composition formulation, method of manufacture and method of using our product candidates. These patent families include:
•We own a patent family that includes over fifteen issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, granted foreign patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Japan, and three pending foreign patent applications. Representative issued U.S. patents in this family include U.S. 10,022,406, U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, U.S. 10,278,997, and U.S. 10,617,724, that have claims 

   directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising stool bacterial material and a cryoprotectant, methods of processing stool received from healthy human donors, methods of manufacturing, and formulations. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2031, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment.
•We exclusively in-license a patent family from the Regents of the University of Minnesota that includes over five issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application, granted foreign patents in Australia, Europe, Canada and China, and three pending foreign patent applications. Representative issued U.S. patents within this family include U.S. 10,028,980, U.S. 10,286,011, U.S. 10,286,012, and U.S. 10,251,914, that have claims directed to formulations comprising fecal bacteria, methods of increasing fecal microbiota diversity, and methods of decreasing relative abundance of a bacteria. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2032, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
 •We own a patent family that includes three issued U.S. patents U.S. 9,901,603, U.S. 10,821,138 and U.S. 11,123,377, one pending U.S. patent application, granted patents in Australia, Japan and China, and nine pending foreign patent applications. These issued U.S. patents have claims directed to room temperature stable products containing human-derived bacteria. Patent applications, if issued, and patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036, assuming all required maintenance fees are paid and absent any applicable patent term extension or patent term adjustment. 
 Complete Consortia Product Candidates, including CP101

Our patent portfolio provides comprehensive patent protection for our Complete Consortia product candidates, including CP101. Representative patents and patent applications from our foundational patent families that have claims that cover CP101 and our Complete Consortia product candidates include:
•One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,617,724) covering capsules containing lyophilized fecal microbiota from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Three owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, and 10,849,937) covering the collection and processing of stool from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,022,406) covering compositions comprising fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Four in-licensed issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,028,980, U.S. 10,286,011, U.S. 10,286,012, and U.S. 10,251,914) covering formulations of fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors and their use, expected to expire in 2032. 
 •Two owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,901,603 and U.S. 10,821,138) covering room-temperature stable products containing human-derived bacteria. 
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,849,936) covering a method of treating C. difficile infection using lyophilized fecal microbiota, expected to expire in 2037. 
 Targeted Consortia Product Candidates

For our Targeted Consortia product candidates and their manufacture, our portfolio consists of several issued U.S. patents from our foundational patent families that provide patent coverage. We are also pursuing product-specific patent protection for each of our Targeted Consortia product candidates including TAK-524. Representative patents that we own and provide protection for our Targeted Consortia product candidates include issued U.S. patents (U.S. 10,610,551 and U.S. 10,278,997) covering compositions having lyophilized bacteria from the genus Bacteroides or the phylum Firmicutes derived from healthy donors and their manufacture, which are expected to expire in 2031.
   Enriched Consortia Product Candidates

Our Enriched Consortia product candidates, such as FIN-211, are protected by many of the same patents and patent applications that cover our Complete Consortia product candidates. We also have patent protection for these Enriched Consortia product candidates specifically as well as various pending applications directed to these product candidates. Representative patents and patent applications that have claims that cover our Enriched Consortia product candidates include:
•One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 11,207,356) covering encapsulated compositions containing donor-derived microbiota enriched with one or more cultured bacterial strains, expected to expire in 2031.
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 11,202,808) covering methods of treating ASD or an associated gastrointestinal symptom by orally administering a donor-derived microbial community and a bacterial isolate from a genus with potential therapeutic applications in ASD, expected to expire in 2037. 
 •One owned issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,022,406) covering compositions comprising fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Three owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,962,413, U.S. 10,328,107, and 10,849,937) covering the collection and processing of stool from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2031. 
 •Two owned issued U.S. patents (U.S. 9,901,603 and U.S. 10,821,138) covering room temperature stable formulations containing human-derived bacteria, expected to expire in 2036. 
 •One in-licensed issued U.S. patent (U.S. 10,286,012) covering the use of formulations of fecal microbiota derived from healthy donors, expected to expire in 2032. 
 Patent Term

Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the USPTO in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension), or both. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent may be shortened by terminal disclaimer, which reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.

Patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 is available for one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of a first approved FDA drug product, or its methods of use or manufacture. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or fourteen years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug product, and a patent cannot be extended more than once or for more than a single product. During the period of extension, if granted, the scope of exclusivity is limited to the approved product for approved uses. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. If and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply, if appropriate, for patent term extension on patents covering those product candidates, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture.
Trade Secrets

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
   Agreements with OpenBiome
Asset Purchase Agreement

In November 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, or the OpenBiome Agreement, with Microbiome Health Research Institute, Inc., or OpenBiome, pursuant to which we acquired certain biological samples, including aliquots of human stool that have been used in clinical trials and under enforcement discretion for the treatment of CDI not responding to standard therapy, and obtained a perpetual license to certain OpenBiome technology, and, upon closing of the transaction, we acquired certain additional assets of OpenBiome, including capital equipment (comprising lab equipment) and contracts relating to the operating maintenance of a lab facility. In connection with entering into the OpenBiome Agreement, we terminated our existing agreements with OpenBiome, as such agreements were superseded by the OpenBiome Agreement and certain other agreements entered into concurrently with the OpenBiome Agreement.

In connection with the signing of the OpenBiome Agreement, OpenBiome granted us a worldwide, irrevocable and perpetual license, with the right to grant sublicenses (through multiple tiers) under certain of OpenBiome’s technology that is necessary or useful in the manufacture of products manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication, which we refer to as Natural Products, including technology pertaining to the selection of human stool donors, the collection and processing of stool from human donors and the preparation of stool-based products, and under any improvements to our intellectual property previously developed by OpenBiome or developed by OpenBiome during a specified period of time after the closing of the transaction, in each case to exploit products and services. In addition to the foregoing license, except under certain limited circumstances, OpenBiome agreed to not license or transfer to our competitors any rights to those aspects of its manufacturing technology that are not publicly available as of the date of the OpenBiome Agreement.

Pursuant to the OpenBiome Agreement, for the period prior to the closing of the transaction we granted OpenBiome a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain Natural Products solely for the treatment of recurrent CDI in the United States under an FDA policy of enforcement discretion and to conduct clinical research in all fields other than the diagnosis, treatment, palliation or prevention in humans of CDI not subject to an FDA policy of enforcement discretion, IBD, ASD or HBV. Additionally, for the period beginning on the closing of the transaction, we granted OpenBiome a worldwide, non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to sell certain Natural Products manufactured prior to the closing of the transaction solely for the treatment of recurrent CDI in the United States under enforcement discretion, and to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export certain Natural Products for purposes of conducting clinical research in all fields other than the diagnosis, treatment, palliation or prevention in humans of CDI not subject to an FDA policy of enforcement discretion, IBD, ASD or HBV. Notwithstanding the foregoing license, OpenBiome has agreed to certain restrictions related to the use, sale and supply of such products in connection with clinical research of our competitors. Additionally, the license grant excludes any license to exploit a Natural Product wherein processed stool is lyophilized (such as in the case of CP101).

In connection with the signing of the OpenBiome Agreement, we paid OpenBiome $1.0 million in the form of an upfront payment and $150,000 as reimbursement for OpenBiome’s attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection the negotiation of the OpenBiome Agreement. On the closing of the transaction, we paid OpenBiome $2.25 million, plus an additional $1.6 million if no regulatory restrictions were in place preventing the sale and distribution of OpenBiome’s products under enforcement discretion as of the date of closing. In addition to the foregoing payments, we are obligated to pay to OpenBiome a low single digit royalty on net sales of Natural Products by us and our affiliates and a high single digit royalty of certain sublicensing revenue (including royalties) received in connection with Natural Products, as well as a low single digit royalty on net sales of TAK-524, FIN-525 and any product that is not a Natural Product or a product that comprises both material manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication and drug substance or drug product comprising one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients, and, in either case contains one or more isolates derived from certain stool donors that are exclusive to us, or Cultured Products, by us and our affiliates and a high single digit percentage of certain sublicensing revenue (including royalties) received in connection with Cultured Products. On a country-by-country basis, our payment obligations with respect to Natural Products expires twenty-five years after first commercial sale of such Natural Product in such country, and, with respect to Cultured Products expires fifteen years after first commercial sale of such Cultured Product in such country. We are also obligated to pay OpenBiome up to $6.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones with Natural Products and $20.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of certain commercial milestones with Natural Products.
   LMIC License Agreement

In November 2020, concurrently with entering into the OpenBiome Agreement, we entered into a license agreement, or the LMIC Agreement, with OpenBiome, pursuant to which we granted OpenBiome a non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain of our patents, patent applications and know-how that are reasonably necessary or useful for the exploitation of products manufactured directly from stool from a stool donor source without the use of culturing or replication, or Natural Products, to make, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import Natural Products and formulated liquid suspensions derived from the stool of a stool donor source that may be incorporated into a Natural Product, in either case for the treatment in humans of malnutrition and neglected tropical diseases in certain low- and middle-income countries, or the LMIC Territory. The license grant excludes any license to exploit a Natural Product wherein processed stool is lyophilized (such as in the case of CP101) or to otherwise use the licensed intellectual property to lyophilize a product.

Pursuant to the LMIC Agreement, we own all improvements, enhancements or modifications to the licensed intellectual property (whether or not patentable) invented by either party during the term of the LMIC Agreement. OpenBiome has agreed to assign to us its interest in and to any such improvements, enhancements or modifications.
 
Pursuant to the LMIC Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of Natural Products and products that incorporate formulated liquid suspensions derived from the stool of a stool donor source that may be incorporated into a Natural Product in the LMIC Territory ranging from mid-single digit to low-second decile. Royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the period beginning on the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim from a licensed patent that covers such product or ten years from the date of the LMIC Agreement.

The LMIC Agreement expires on product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon expiry of the applicable royalty obligation for such product in such country. OpenBiome has the right to terminate the LMIC Agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party of either the LMIC Agreement (or uncured breach by OpenBiome of the OpenBiome Agreement), provided that if such uncured material breach is limited to a breach of the LMIC Agreement in a particular country, our right to terminate the LMIC Agreement is limited to just such country. Either party may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event of the insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the LMIC Agreement in the event that OpenBiome brings, or assists in bringing, a challenge to the validity, patentability, scope, construction, inventorship, ownership, enforceability or non-infringement of any licensed patent or patent application.
Government Regulation

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, such as our product candidates and any future product candidates. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval or licensure, as well as administrative or judicial sanctions.
Regulatory Approval of Biological Products in the United States
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biological products are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biological product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made; 

   •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all clinical trials; 
 •payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Preclinical Studies
Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and eligibility criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the investigational product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances.
   A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if, among other things, the clinical trial was conducted with qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the biological product candidate. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the biological product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies conducted in a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy of the biological product candidate for its intended use, further evaluate its safety and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biological product candidate. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
The FDA may, at any time while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Additionally, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within fifteen calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, companies must
   develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
FDA Review Processes of Biological Products
Assuming successful completion of all required testing and clinical trials of a biological product candidate in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the identity, quality, safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
The FDA reviews a submitted BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing and may request additional information from the sponsor. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with any additional information requested. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the biological product candidate is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Under the goals agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date for both standard and priority review BLAs may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether such facilities comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
The FDA also may inspect one or more clinical sites and audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions on approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product is produced, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s)
   and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months from receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the biological product outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a product’s safe use, or ETASU. An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, one or more post-market clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, and testing and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after approval, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Among the benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. In addition, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used off-label for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.
A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if a second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
   Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For example, Fast Track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and where preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for Fast Track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including under the Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
Breakthrough Therapy designation may be granted for product candidates that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new biological product candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a Breakthrough Therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biological product candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner. The designation also includes all of the Fast Track program features, including eligibility for rolling review of BLA submissions if the relevant criteria are met.
Priority review may be granted for product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provide a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of the product candidate and substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in some cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA prior to the intended date or dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
   Pediatric Information and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g. new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a biological product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biological product in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Post-Approval Requirements for Biological Products
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain additional post-approval requirements, such as quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures that must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Manufacturers of biological products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control, quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, including those focused on manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

   The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biological products, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a biological product candidate, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration, Biosimilars and Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our biological product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The United State Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes
   by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product may not be accepted by the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States and Europe, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or European Commission approval.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, market acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these drugs and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management organizations, and other private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational.
While no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Therefore, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Further, third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Accordingly, third-party payors could require us to conduct additional studies, including post-marketing studies related to the cost-effectiveness of a product, to qualify for reimbursement, which could be costly and divert resources.
Outside of the United States, the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, medical product prices are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental
   authorities can take considerable time after a product receives marketing approval. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In general, product prices under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.
Further, the commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on the availability of insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and managed care organizations, which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. Moreover, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. If government and other healthcare payors were not to provide adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement levels for one any of our products once approved, market acceptance and commercial success would be limited.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Legislative Reform
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payors and customers subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (including the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Services Administration), or HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arrangement for, or recommendation of the purchase, lease, order, or arrangement for, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act; 
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of or approval from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Drug manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, 

   purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, among other things, imposes civil and criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. HIPAA also creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 •federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; 
 •the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and (ii) physician ownership and investment interests, including such ownership and investment interests held by a physician’s immediate family members;
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; 
 •state and foreign laws that are analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may impose similar or more prohibitive restrictions, and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and 
 •state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other healthcare providers; state laws that require the reporting of marketing expenditures or drug pricing, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals; state laws that require the posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes; and other federal, state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information or personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, including state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts. 

   If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other current or future healthcare laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful. In addition, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
Legislative Reform
We operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.
For example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs such as:
•increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; 
 •established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; 
 •expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; 
 •established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 •extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
 •established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and 
 •created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products. 
 
   There have been judicial, executive branch and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the health reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2011, the U.S. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act, which included provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, absent additional congressional action. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, and subsequent legislation, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, in 2012, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If government spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA, to continue to function at current levels, which may impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any product candidates we may develop. Moreover, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented, or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us, as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.
Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose implementing drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump signed several executive orders aimed at lowering drug prices. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.
   Employees and Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had 189 employees. Of these 189 employees, 156 are engaged in research and development activities and 33 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, information systems, facilities, human resources or administrative support. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards.
 
We believe that our long-term success requires a diverse and inclusive workforce. We value diversity at all levels of the organization and continue to focus on extending our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, including through our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee, which is a cross-functional group designed to create programs focused on understanding employees’ intersecting identities, honoring differences and rooting out systemic inequity. In addition, we pride ourselves on an open culture that respects co-workers, values employees’ health and well-being and fosters professional development. We conduct regular employee engagement surveys, and our board of directors provides input on important decisions relating to these matters, including with respect to employee compensation and benefits and talent acquisition and retention.
