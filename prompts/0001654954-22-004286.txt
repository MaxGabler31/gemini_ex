Item 1 Business
General

Smith-Midland Corporation (the “Company”) invents, develops, manufactures, markets, leases, licenses, sells, and installs a broad array of precast concrete products and systems for use primarily in the construction, highway, utilities and farming industries through its six wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s precast, licensing, and barrier rental customers are primarily general contractors and federal, state, and local transportation authorities located in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. The Company’s operating strategy has involved producing and marketing innovative and proprietary products, including SlenderWall®, a patented, lightweight, energy efficient concrete and steel exterior wall panel for use in building construction; J-J Hooks® Highway Safety Barrier, a patented, positive-connected highway safety barrier; SoftSound™, a proprietary sound absorptive finish used on the face of sound barriers to absorb traffic noise; Sierra Wall™, a patented sound barrier primarily for roadside use; Easi-Set® and Easi-Span® patented transportable concrete buildings; and Beach Prisms™ erosion mitigating modules. In addition, the Company’s precast subsidiaries produce farm products such as cattleguards and water and feed troughs, custom order precast concrete products with various architectural surfaces, and generic highway sound barriers, retaining walls and utility vaults.

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 2, 1994. Prior to a corporate reorganization completed in October 1994, the Company conducted its business primarily through Smith-Midland Virginia, which was incorporated in 1960 as Smith Cattleguard Company, a Virginia corporation, and which subsequently changed its name to Smith-Midland Corporation in 1985. The Company’s principal offices are located at 5119 Catlett Road, Midland, Virginia 22728 and its telephone number is 540-439-3266. As used in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the term the “Company” refers to Smith-Midland Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries consist of Smith-Midland Corporation, a Virginia corporation; Smith-Carolina Corporation, a North Carolina corporation; Smith-Columbia Corporation, a South Carolina corporation, Easi-Set Industries, Inc., a Virginia corporation doing business as Easi-Set Worldwide; Concrete Safety Systems, Inc., a Virginia corporation; and Midland Advertising and Design, Inc., a Virginia corporation doing business as Midland Advertising + Design.

Market

The Company’s precast concrete products market and barrier rental market primarily consists of general contractors performing public and private construction contracts, including the construction of commercial buildings, public and private roads and highways, and airports, municipal utilities, and federal, state, and local transportation authorities, primarily located in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. Due to the lightweight characteristics of the SlenderWall® exterior cladding system, the Company has expanded its competitive services outside of the Mid-Atlantic states. The Company’s licensing subsidiary licenses its proprietary products to precast concrete manufacturers nationwide and internationally in Canada, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, and Trinidad.

The precast concrete products market is affected by the cyclical nature of the construction industry. In addition, the demand for construction varies depending upon weather conditions, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, overall fluctuations in the national and regional economies, past overbuilding, labor relations in the construction industry, and the availability of material and energy supplies. A substantial portion of the Company’s business is derived from local, state, and federal building projects, which are further dependent upon budgets and, in some cases, voter-approved bonds.

Products

The Company’s precast concrete products are cast in manufacturing facilities and delivered to a site for installation, in contrast to ready-mix concrete, which is produced offsite in a “batch plant,” and delivered with a concrete mixer truck where it is mixed and delivered to a construction site to be poured and set at the site. Precast concrete products are used primarily as parts of buildings or highway structures, and may be used architecturally, as a decorative wall of a building. Structural uses include building walls, frames, floors, or roofs. The Company currently manufactures and sells a wide variety of products for use in the construction, transportation, and utility industries.

SlenderWall® Lightweight Construction Panels

The SlenderWall® system is a patented prefabricated, energy-efficient, lightweight exterior cladding system that is offered as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional cladding used for the exterior walls of buildings. The Company’s SlenderWall® system combines the essential components of a wall system into a single panel ready for interior drywall mounting upon installation. The base components of each SlenderWall® panel consists of a galvanized stud frame with an exterior surface of approximately two-inch thick, steel reinforced, high-density, precast concrete (with integral water repellent), a thermal break, and various architectural surfaces. The exterior architectural concrete facing is attached to the interior steel frame by use of coated stainless steel fasteners that position the exterior concrete away from the steel frame to provide improved thermal performance.

SlenderWall® panels are approximately one-third the weight of traditional precast concrete walls of equivalent size, and are also significantly improved as to permanence and durability. The lighter weight translates into reduced construction costs resulting from less onerous structural and foundation requirements as well as lower shipping costs. Additional savings result from reduced installation time, ease of erection, and the use of smaller cranes for installation. Closed-cell foam insulation and windows can be plant-installed further reducing cost and construction schedules.

The Company custom designs, manufactures, installs, and licenses the SlenderWall® exterior cladding system. The exterior of the SlenderWall® system can be produced in a variety of architectural finishes, such as concrete, exposed stone, granite, metal, or thin brick and can be integrated with other cladding materials.

Sierra Wall™

The Sierra Wall™ (“Sierra Wall”) combines the strength and durability of precast concrete with a variety of finishes to provide an effective and attractive sound and sight barrier for use alongside highways around residential, industrial, and commercial properties. With additional reinforcement, Sierra Wall can also be used as a retaining wall to retain earth in both highway and residential construction. Sierra Wall is typically constructed of four-inch thick, steel-reinforced concrete panels with an integral column creating a tongue and groove connection system. This tongue and groove connection system and its foundation connection make Sierra Wall easy to install and move if boundaries change or highways are relocated after the completion of a project. The patented Sierra Wall II one-piece extended post and panel design reduces installation time and cost.

The Company custom designs and manufactures Sierra Wall components to conform to the specifications provided by the contractor. The width, height, strength, and exterior finish of each wall varies depending upon the terrain and application. The Company also produces generic post and panel design sound barrier wall systems. These systems are constructed of steel or precast concrete columns (the Company manufactures the precast or prestressed columns) with precast concrete panels which slide down into the groove in each column.

Sierra Wall is used primarily for highway projects as a noise barrier as well as for residential purposes, such as privacy walls between homes, security walls or windbreaks, and for industrial or commercial purposes, such as to screen and protect shopping centers, industrial operations, institutions or highways. The variety of available finishes enables the Company to blend the Sierra Wall with local architecture, creating an attractive, as well as functional, barrier.

J-J Hooks® Highway Safety Barrier

The J-J Hooks® highway safety barriers (the “J-J Hooks Barriers”) are crash-tested (privately funded), positively connected, safety barriers that the Company sells, rents, delivers, installs, and licenses for use on roadways to separate lanes of traffic (in free-standing, bolted, or pinned installations) in construction work zones or for traffic control. Barriers are deemed to be positively connected when the connectors on each end of the barrier sections are interlocked with one another. J-J Hooks Barriers interlock without the need for a separate locking device. The primary advantage of a positive connection is that a barrier with such a connection can withstand vehicle crashes at higher speeds without separating. The Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”) requires that states use only positively connected barriers, which meet NCHRP-350 or MASH crash test requirements. J-J Hooks Barriers that meet NCHRP-350 and MASH TL3 requirements are deemed eligible by the FHWA for federal-aid reimbursement. The Company has been issued patents with respect to J-J Hooks in the United States, Canada, and other countries.

The Company has received “design protection” in the U.S for the “end taper” on each end of the barrier sections. The United States has issued a “trade dress” registration for the “end taper” design feature. Accordingly, in the United States, these features cannot be legally copied by others.

The proprietary feature of J-J Hooks Barrier is the design of its positive connection. Protruding from each end of a J-J Hooks Barrier section is a fabricated bent steel connector; rolled in toward the end of the barrier, resembling the letter “J” when viewed from directly above. The connector protruding from each end of the barrier is rolled identically so that when one end of a barrier faces the end of another, the resulting “J-Hook” face each other. To connect one section of a J-J Hooks Barrier to another, a contractor merely positions the J-Hook of an elevated section of the barrier above the J-Hook of a set section and lowers the elevated section into place. The positive connection is automatically engaged using the cast-in alignment slot.

The Company believes that the J-J Hooks Barrier load transfer connection design is superior to other highway safety barriers that were positively connected through the “eye and pin” technique. Barriers incorporating this technique have eyes or loops protruding from each end of the barrier, which must be aligned during the setting process. Once set, a crew inserts pins or long bolts through the eyes which connects and bolts the barrier sections together. Compared to this technique, the J-J Hooks Barriers are easier and faster to install and remove, require a smaller crew, and eliminates the need for loose hardware to make the connection.

In March 1999, the FHWA approved the free-standing J-J Hooks Barrier (tested in accordance with NCHRP-350 Test Level 3) following successful crash testing in accordance with National Cooperative Highway Research Program requirements. In December 2012 the FHWA approved the pinned and bolted J-J Hooks and in March 2018 approved the free-standing J-J Hooks. In September 2018 the FHWA approved a 20-foot design originally tested to NCHRP-350 TL3 requirements and approved by the FHWA (tested in accordance with MASH Test Level 3) for use on federally aided highway projects following the successful completion of crash testing based on criteria from the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware.

J-J Hooks NCHRP-350 free-standing barrier has been approved for use on state and federally funded projects by 42 states, plus Washington, D.C. The Company is in various stages of the application process in additional states and believes that approval in some of the states will be granted; however no assurance can be given that approval will be received from any or all of the remaining states or that such approval will result in the J-J Hooks Barrier being used in such states. In addition, J-J Hooks Barrier has been approved by the appropriate authorities for use in the countries of Canada (Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario), Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and Chile.

J-J Hooks restrained (pinned or bolted) barrier successfully passed the MASH TL3 tests in August of 2012 and received FHWA Eligibility Letters in December 2012. Currently 39 states have approved the MASH restrained barrier and 39 states have approved the MASH free-standing design as an alternate to their state standard. New Zealand, Australia, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Nova Scotia, have approved the MASH tested barrier. The new J-J Hooks free-standing barrier successfully passed the two required MASH TL3 tests and in January 2018 and August 2018 received the FHWA federal-aid eligibility letters. The FHWA Eligibility letters B300 and B307 have been issued as of February 2018 and September 2018, respectively.

Easi-Set Precast Buildings and Easi-Span® Expandable Precast Buildings

Easi-Set Precast Buildings are transportable, prefabricated, single-story, all concrete buildings designed to be adaptable to a variety of uses ranging from housing communications operations, traffic control systems, mechanical and electrical stations, to inventory or supply storage, restroom facilities or kiosks. Easi-Set Precast Buildings and Restrooms are available in a variety of exterior finishes and in 38 standard sizes, or can be custom sized. The roof and floor of each Easi-Set Building is manufactured using the Company’s second generation post-tensioned system, which helps seal the buildings against moisture. As freestanding units, the Easi-Set Buildings require no poured foundations or footings and can be easily installed within a few hours. After installation the buildings can be moved, if desired, and reinstalled in a new location. The Company has been issued patents in connection with this product in the United States and Canada.

The Company also offers Easi-Span® a line of expandable precast concrete buildings. Easi-Span® incorporates the technology of the Easi-Set Buildings, but are available in larger sizes and, through its modular construction, can be combined in varied configurations to permit expansion capabilities. Since these larger buildings have less competition from other materials and methods, they produce higher profit margins. Both the Easi-Span and Easi-Set Buildings offer lines of fully-outfitted restrooms with over a dozen standard models.

Easi-Set Utility Vault

The Company produces a line of precast concrete underground utility vaults ranging in size from 27 to 1,008 cubic feet. Each Easi-Set utility vault normally comes with a manhole opening on the top for ingress and egress and openings around the perimeter, in accordance with the customer’s specifications, to access water and gas pipes, electrical power lines, telecommunications cables, or other such media of transfer. The utility vaults may be used to house equipment such as cable, telephone or traffic signal equipment, and for underground storage. The Company also manufactures custom-built utility vaults for special needs.
SoftSound™ Soundwall Panels

SoftSound™ soundwall panels utilize a “wood chip aggregate” material applied to the face of soundwall panels, which is used to absorb highway noise. SoftSound™ is a proprietary product developed and tested by the Company and is currently approved for use in Virginia, Maryland, seven additional states, and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Approvals are still pending in a number of additional states. The Company introduced this product line into its licensing program and is in the process of seeking to obtain approvals in all 50 states and the Canadian Provinces.
Beach Prisms™ Erosion Control Modules

Beach Prisms™ is a shoreline erosion control product that uses the preferred natural “soft” approach as opposed to the “hard” approach of seawalls and jetties, to solve this worldwide problem. Beach Prisms™ work by reducing the amount of energy in incoming waves before the waves reach the shoreline. Waves pass through the specially designed slots in the triangular 3-4 foot tall by 10 foot long Beach Prisms™ modules. The success of a Beach Prisms™ installation is dependent on the prevailing wind in relation to the shoreline, the tides, the fetch and the availability of sand in the surf. Beach Prisms™ are primarily for river- and bay-front property owners who want an alternative to traditional armor stone, or groins and jetties. The Company received “design protection” in the United States for the Beach Prisms™ in 2010. State and local approvals are necessary for installation of the product, and the Company has experienced challenges receiving approvals in their local markets.
H2Out™ Secondary Drainage System

H2Out™ is the first “in the caulk joint” secondary drainage and street level leak detection product for panelized exterior cladding. A second line of caulking and drainage strip located behind the exterior line of caulking exits all water leakage to the exterior of the building preventing moisture and mold, and hence deterring lawsuits from tenants and owners of buildings. H2Out™ has been added as a feature of the SlenderWall® system and is being included in the product literature, website, and all sales presentations.

Although the Company is optimistic about the success of Beach Prisms™ and H2Out™, there can be no assurance of the commercial acceptance of these products and, in the case of Beach Prisms™, there can be no assurance of regulatory approvals.

Sources of Supply

All of the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of the Company’s products are available from multiple sources. To date, the Company has experienced minor delays in obtaining materials, but believes that it will be able to obtain required materials from a number of suppliers at commercially reasonable prices.

Licensing

The Company presently grants licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary Easi-Set Industries for the manufacturing and sale rights for certain proprietary products, such as the J-J Hooks® Barrier, Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® Precast Buildings, SlenderWall®, SoftSound™ and Beach Prisms™. Generally, licenses are granted for a point of manufacture. The Company receives an initial one-time training and administration license fee varying on the product licensed. License royalties vary depending upon the product licensed, and typically range from 4% to 6% of the net sales of the licensed product. In addition, Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® Buildings and SlenderWall® licensees pay the Company a monthly fee for co-op advertising & promotional programs. The Company produces and distributes advertising & promotional materials and promotes the licensed products through its own advertising subsidiary, Midland Advertising + Design.

The Company maintains 56 licensing agreements in the United States, 9 in Canada, and 1 each in Australia, Belgium, Mexico, New Zealand and Trinidad, for a total of 70 licenses worldwide.

The Company is continually discussing new license arrangements with potential precast companies and, although no assurance can be given, expects to increase its licensing activities.

Marketing and Sales

The Company uses an in-house sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives to market its precast concrete products through trade show attendance, sales presentations, virtual meetings, advertisements in trade publications, and direct mail to end users.

The Company has also established a cooperative advertising program in which the Company and its Easi-Set®/Easi-Span® Buildings and SlenderWall® licensees combine resources to promote certain precast concrete products. Licensees pay a monthly fee and the Company pays any additional amounts required to advertise the products across the country. Although the Company advertises nationally, the Company’s precast subsidiaries marketing efforts are concentrated within a 450 mile radius from its facilities, which includes the majority of the eastern United States.

The Company’s precast product sales and barrier rental sales result primarily from the submission of estimates or proposals to general contractors who then include the estimates in their overall bids to various government agencies and other end users that solicit construction contracts through a competitive bidding process. In general, these contractors solicit and obtain their construction contracts by submitting the most attractive bid to the party desiring the construction. The Company’s role in the bidding process is to provide estimates to the contractors desiring to include the Company’s products or services in the contractor’s bid. If a contractor who accepts the Company’s bid is selected to perform the construction, the Company provides the agreed upon products or services. In many instances, the Company provides estimates to more than one of the contractors bidding on a single project. The Company also occasionally negotiates with and sells directly to end-users.

Competition

The precast concrete industry is highly competitive and consists of a few large companies and many small to mid-size companies, several of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. Nationally, several large companies dominate the precast concrete market. However, due to the weight and costs of delivery of precast concrete products, competition in the industry tends to be limited by geographical location and distance from the construction site and is fragmented with numerous manufacturers in a large local area.

The Company believes that the principal competitive factors for its precast products are price, durability, ease of use and installation, speed of production and delivery time, ability to customize, FHWA and state approval, and customer service. The Company believes that its plants in Midland, Virginia, Reidsville, North Carolina and Hopkins (Columbia), South Carolina compete favorably with respect to each of these factors in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States. Finally, the Company believes it offers a broad range of products that are highly competitive in these markets.

Intellectual Property

The Company seeks to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. Our intellectual property assets include patents, patent applications, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, operating and instruction manuals, crash tests, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements.

While the Company intends to vigorously enforce its patent rights against infringement by third parties, no assurance can be given that the patents or the Company’s patent rights will be enforceable or provide the Company with meaningful protection from competitors or that its patent applications will be allowed. Even if a competitor’s products were to infringe patents held by the Company, enforcing the patent rights in an enforcement action could be very costly, and assuming the Company has sufficient resources, would divert funds and resources that otherwise could be used in the Company’s operations. No assurance can be given that the Company would be successful in enforcing such rights, that the Company’s products or processes do not infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of a third party, or that if the Company is not successful in a suit involving patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party, that a license for such technology would be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Government Regulation

The Company frequently supplies products and services pursuant to agreements with general contractors who have entered into contracts with federal or state governmental agencies. The successful completion of the Company’s obligations under such contracts is often subject to the satisfactory inspection or approval of such products and services by a representative of the contracting agency. Although the Company targets to satisfy the requirements of each such contract to which it is a party, no assurance can be given that the necessary approval of its products and services will be granted on a timely basis or at all and that the Company will receive any payments due to it. Any failure to obtain such approval and payment may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive and stringent governmental regulations including regulations related to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and environmental protection. The Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with all applicable regulations. The cost of maintaining such compliance is not considered by the Company to be significant.

The Company’s employees in its manufacturing division operate complicated machinery that may cause substantial injury or death upon malfunction or improper operation. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are subject to the workplace safety rules and regulations of OSHA. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of OSHA.

During the normal course of its operations, the Company uses and disposes of materials, such as solvents and lubricants used in equipment maintenance, that are classified as hazardous by government agencies that regulate environmental quality. The Company attempts to minimize the generation of such waste as much as possible, and to recycle such waste where possible. Remaining wastes are disposed of in permitted disposal sites in accordance with applicable regulations.

In the event that the Company is unable to comply with the OSHA or environmental requirements, the Company could be subject to substantial sanctions, including restrictions on its business operations, monetary liability and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.

Human Capital Resources

As of March 14, 2022, the Company had a total of 200 employees, of which 178 are full-time, 6 are part-time and 16 are temporary workers, with 147 located at the Company’s Midland, Virginia facility, 28 are located at the Company’s facility in Reidsville, North Carolina and 25 are located at the Company’s facility in Hopkins (Columbia), South Carolina. None of the Company’s employees are represented by labor organizations and the Company is not aware of any activities seeking such organization. The Company considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.

We manage our Company according to our vision, mission, and core principles. Included among these principles are respect for people, lead with humility, kaizen spirit, focus on process, seek perfection, assure quality at the source, create consistency of purpose, embrace scientific thinking, think systemically, and create value for the customer. We continue to focus on training and development of our associates at every level in the organization, and pride ourselves on safety, quality, delivery, morale, and cost. We expect that these approaches to leading and empowering our associates will create trust with our customers, creating sustainability and growth of the business.
