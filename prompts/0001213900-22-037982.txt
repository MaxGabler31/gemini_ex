Item 1 Business



Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, all product names and trade names used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) are the Company’s trademarks, although the “®” and “™” trademark designations may have been omitted.



As used in this Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ecoark,” “Ecoark Holdings” and the “Company” mean Ecoark Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.



Overview



Ecoark Holdings Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a diversified holding company incorporated in 2007. Through Ecoark’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company has subsidiaries focused on three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations on approximately 30,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and transportation services, (ii) Bitcoin mining, and (iii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology. The Company also had operations providing financial services until June 17, 2022 when it sold Trend Discovery Holdings LLC (“Trend Holdings”) to a third party.



Since the acquisition of Banner Midstream Corp. (“Banner”) on March 27, 2020, which currently comprises the exploration, production and drilling operations and energy transportation business, the Company has focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring oil and gas leases, working interests in oil and gas mineral leases, and related assets. The Company’s principal subsidiaries consist of Agora Digital Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Agora”) which is focused on Bitcoin mining, Banner which is focused on oil and gas exploration and oilfield services, and Zest Labs, Inc. (“Zest” or “Zest Labs”) which is focused on monetizing a portfolio of over 75 patents in the area of fresh food technology.



White River Operating LLC (“White River”) and Shamrock Upstream Energy, LLC (“Shamrock”), wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company through Banner, are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on approximately 30,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.



Pinnacle Frac LLC (“Pinnacle Frac”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company through Banner, provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” and drilling operations.



Beginning in September 2021 when Agora was formed, the Company also began developing and implementing a new line of business mining Bitcoin, with the possibility of also entering the Decentralized Finance, or “DeFi” space. Agora’s initial Bitcoin mining operations commenced in late calendar year 2021. Because of regulatory uncertainty over cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin being deemed to be securities, Agora’s initial focus is on mining Bitcoin which the Company believes is not a security.

Key Developments in the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2022



The Company has continued to grow its oil and gas exploration and drilling, energy transportation business and also commenced its Bitcoin mining operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (“FY 2022”) and achieved or experienced the following key developments:



On March 4, 2022, Banner successfully completed the drilling of an oil project on its 9,615 acre oil and gas mineral lease in the Blackhawk oil field in Concordia Parish, Louisiana on March 4, 2022. White River led the drilling effort in close partnership with a local energy services provider. The completed well was logged March 5, 2022 and had significant shows in the 3 different zones in the Frio sand formation.

White River purchased an MD Cowan Super Single drilling rig for $351,813 to add to its three workover rigs it owns. This purchase is expected to enable White River to drill its own vertical wells at both shallow and deep levels. This purchase, together with the recent financing described below, will facilitate the expansion of the Company’s drilling program.



During FY 2022, we made a conscious decision to enter the Bitcoin mining business. To advance that goal, we formed Agora on September 17, 2021, transferred our former financial services business, Trend Holdings, to Agora and provided loans to enable it to commence its mining business and initiate its planned public offering. On October 8, 2021 Agora filed a confidential draft registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 377-05577), and Agora filed the corresponding registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-261246) on November 19, 2021 (as amended, the “Agora Registration Statement”) in connection with its initial public offering of units comprised of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock. The Agora Registration Statement has undergone a series of amendments since its initial confidential filing in October 2021 and has not yet been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, in connection with Agora’s planned initial public offering, Agora has applied for its common stock and warrants to be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). That offering has been delayed to regulatory factors outside the Company’s control due to pending and novel accounting issues arising from Bitcoin mining. Agora expects to file an amendment to the Agora Registration Statement shortly after completion of its audit for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.



Because of the recent collapse in the price of Bitcoin and the weakness in the stock market, we are uncertain whether Agora can complete its initial public offering or, if it can, how much money it can raise or how dilutive it will be to its shareholders including the Company which owns over 90% of outstanding shares.



Because of our need to raise capital for current business operations and growth of existing business lines, on June 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Digital Power Lending, LLC (“DPL”), a subsidiary of BitNile Holdings, Inc. (“BitNile”), pursuant to which the Company sold DPL 1,200 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A”), 102,881 shares of Common Stock (the “Commitment Shares”) and a warrant to purchase up to 49% of our Common Stock for nominal consideration for a total purchase price of $12,000,000. The Company intends to use the proceeds for our drilling program, lending up to $5 million to Agora for use in deploying power and infrastructure for its Bitcoin mining operations, fees and expenses in connection with spin-offs of our subsidiaries, and for general corporate purposes and working capital. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” on page 58 for more information on the recent financing and our liquidity and capital resources.



On September 21, 2021, Ecoark Holdings and Zest Labs filed a complaint against Deloitte Consulting, LLP (“Deloitte”) in the Eight Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada for violation of the Nevada Uniform Trade Secret Act and seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction, attorney’s fees, and punitive damages. On March 10, 2022, the Court denied Deloitte’s motion to dismiss the case, and allow the case to move forward to the discovery phase which is expected to start after July 1, 2022. See “Legal Proceedings.”



On October 6, 2021, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders, at which the stockholders approved (a) an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock of the Company from 30,000,000 shares to 40,000,000 shares; (b) an amendment to the Ecoark Holdings, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under this plan from 800,000 shares to 1,300,000 shares; and (c) the issuance of 272,000 restricted stock units and an additional 64,000 restricted stock units to the then President of Zest under the 2017 Plan, in exchange for the cancellation of 672,000 previously issued stock options.



On October 1, 2021, the Company purchased 41,671,121 shares of Agora common stock for $4,167,111 which Agora used to purchase equipment to commence the Bitstream Mining, LLC (“Bitstream”) operations.



On September 1, 2021 the Company and White River entered into an agreement with several individuals to acquire working interests in the various leases in Concordia, LA for $53,500.



On August 16, 2021 the Company and Shamrock entered into an agreement with a privately-held limited liability company to acquire working interests in the Luling Prospect for $250,000.





2







On August 4, 2021, the Company’s common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.



On April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest damages which included $65 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages and found Walmart Inc. liable on three counts. For further disclosure on the Walmart litigation, see “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”



Recent Subsidiary Transactions



Prior to Agora’s sale of Trend Holdings on June 17, 2022, Trend Holdings held four subsidiaries including: Barrier Crest LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Barrier Crest”), and Trend Discovery Exploration LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Trend Exploration”) and Trend Discovery Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company which were disposed of together with Trend Holdings as part of the sale. The purchaser is an entity formed by the investment manager of Trend Discovery LP and Trend Discovery SPV which issued Agora a three-year $4,250,000 secured note. Each of the Trend Holdings subsidiaries including Barrier Crest guaranteed the note and provided Agora with a first lien on its assets. An additional mutually agreed upon closing condition of the transaction was for Trend Exploration to assign its interest in oil and gas wells back to the White River entities and one-related party. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition, prior to the sale Trend Holdings assigned Bitstream and one inactive entity to Agora.



Upon completion of these events, Agora is left with one active subsidiary, Bitstream. Further information about the foregoing transactions and the relationship among these entities and the parties can be found in “Certain Relationships And Related Party Transactions.”



Description of Business



Banner Midstream Corp



The Company entered the oil and gas industry following the previously disclosed acquisition of Banner in March 2020. Below are descriptions of the Company’s subsidiaries and operations through Banner.
White River and Shamrock



Through its indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, White River and Shamrock, which are owned by Banner, the Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 30,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. These subsidiaries are each engaged in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisition, and exploration activities principally in the above-referenced states. We may also expand our energy asset portfolio or engage in other energy-related strategic transactions as they arise, provided we have sufficient capital and market and regulatory conditions otherwise enable favorable to such transactions. Such transactions may serve a number of business objectives, including by seeking to expand our product and service offerings and/or to increase our geographic footprint.



We have acquired numerous oil and gas leases and oil and working interests in leases therein, as well as related personal property and equipment, beginning with our acquisition of Banner in March 2020. We also entered into a Participation Agreement with BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. and GeoTerre, LLC, unrelated third parties, to conduct the drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation pursuant to which we have agreed to provide the capital investment of $5,746,941 (of which approximately $3,387,000 was expensed in fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (“FY 2021”)) in the project in exchange for a majority working interest in and net revenue from the energy resources produced by the wells. Using proceeds from the recent preferred stock financing, Ecoark is commencing an extensive drilling plan which will include drilling projects at both shallow and deep levels across these oil and gas mineral leases.

A large portion of our Banner business is focused on developing and commercializing these holdings and transactions to produce and sell revenue-generating energy resources, particularly oil. Our exploration and drilling operations are principally focused on sand formations rather than shale formations, as the latter are very deep and involve horizontal drilling complexities that sand formations do not. One major advantage of our focus on sand formation is that the wells can be drilled vertically as opposed to the shale wells which are usually lateral. Examples of sand formations the Company operates on through Banner are the Frio Formation of the Texas Gulf Coast Basin which is located in Southern Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and has a depth of 3,000 feet, and the Wilcox Formation in Texas and Louisiana, which has a depth of 9,000 feet. The Company also has oil and gas mineral leases covering deep levels below the aforementioned sand formations including, but not limited to, the Austin Chalk and Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formations.



The Company has continuous drilling requirements to drill or re-complete a well on its 9,615 Peabody Blackhawk lease every 270 days to keep the lease active. The Company drilled and completed a well in February 2022 on this oil and gas mineral lease and extended the lease to at least November 2022. See Note 23 to Item 8. “Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.”



Our oil and gas exploration, production and drilling operations constituted the second-largest source of revenue in FY 2022, behind our transportation services which are covered in the subsections describing Pinnacle Frac that immediately follow.



Pinnacle Frac 



Through Pinnacle Frac, the Company provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Our transportation services entail using third party drivers who assist in transporting sand and related materials to customers’ locations for the customers’ hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The logistics services Pinnacle Frac provides for its customers’ fracking and drilling enterprises, include the operation of a 24/7 dispatch service center based in Texas through which we dispatch the trucks for hauling frac sand and related equipment. Pinnacle Frac uses independent third party owner-operators of trucks to service its customers in their fracking operations by transporting materials, mainly frac sand. Our transportation and logistics services operations are primarily centered in the Southern United States, although we also occasionally service fracking operations in the Northeastern United States.



Pinnacle Frac uses a third party’s licensed software known as “Sandbox” to monitor and execute its transportation and logistics operations. Use of this service offers the following benefits for customers and other industry participants:




● | Reduced road traffic.
--+----------------------


● | Reduced personnel on frac site.
--+--------------------------------


● | Eliminate silica dust particles.
--+---------------------------------




By operating a call center and using specialized licensed software to meet customers’ demand for timely delivery and movement of fracking materials, Pinnacle Frac facilitates customers’ fracking operations through the life cycle of the drilling process.



Hydraulic Fracturing



Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process that creates fractures extending from the well bore into the rock formation to enable natural gas or oil contained in the rock to move more easily from the rock pores to a production conduit, or an opening at the surface designed to allow for extraction of the energy resource. The hydraulic fracturing technique is used to enable the extraction of natural gas or oil from shale and other forms of “tight” rock, or in other words, impermeable rock formations that lock in oil and gas and make fossil fuel production difficult. The process entails blasting water, chemicals, and sand into these formations at pressures high enough to crack the rock in which the targeted resources is embedded, allowing the once-trapped gas and oil to flow to the surface.



Because the process is highly reliant on an ample supply of sand and other materials, Pinnacle Frac capitalizes on this demand by helping its customers timely supply the materials to the drilling site in sufficient quantities to complete the process. Our customers consist of oil and gas drilling to which we may be the prime contractor, and third party contractors assisting with another party’s drilling operation for which we serve as the subcontractor.





4







Due to concerns surrounding health, safety and environmental, or HSE, impacts of hydraulic fracturing, Pinnacle Frac takes an active role in assessing occupational risk and finding methods to better manage these issues. To further these efforts, we have implemented an HSE program which consists of the following key features aimed at avoiding, preventing, detecting and mitigating certain hazards that are inherent in operating as a participant in the hydraulic fracturing field:




● | Jobs Safety Analysis (JSA) Program
--+-----------------------------------


● | Near-Miss Reporting System
--+---------------------------


● | Accident Reporting System
--+--------------------------




All programs are designed with the purpose of mitigating the risk of future safety incidents, while also ensuring that when rare instances occur when a safety incident does occur, that the Company has a plan to address in a consistent, formal manner to ensure the utmost safety for its employees and contractors.



To enhance safety, each of our Pinnacle Frac employees and contractors are put through our safety program to meet the needs of our customers while maintaining adequate safety protocols. Through this system, workers gain knowledge of how to maintain optimum work conditions and be prepared for the variety of potential challenges that may arise.



We monitor performance under our HSE program throughout the year to evaluate our goals are being met, or address any concerns in this regard should they arise.



Agora Digital Holdings, Inc.



Following the Company’s sale of Trend Holdings sale, Agora’s only operating subsidiary, Bitstream, engages in the mining of Bitcoin. Bitstream is expected to be the focal point of Agora’s operations during the next 12 months. For this reason, and because of the substantial investments the Company has made in Bitstream (and Trend Holdings prior to the sale) through loans to Agora totaling $4,760,759 which are outstanding and mature in March 2023, set forth below is an overview of Bitstream’s developments, planned operations and the Bitcoin assets and industry in which it operates. The Company also expects to loan Agora up to $5 million from its recent $12 million private placement.
Bitstream



Bitstream was organized to be our Bitcoin mining subsidiary. Bitstream has entered into a series of agreements including procuring land to install Bitcoin mining equipment, arranging for a reliable and economical electric power source needed to efficiently mine Bitcoin, ordering miners, housing infrastructure and other infrastructure to mine Bitcoin and locating a third-party hosting service to operate the miners and the service’s more advanced miners. Agora has spent (and agreed to spend) between $12 - $14 million in connection with these agreements, not including future revenue sharing. Agora brought online entry level miners that began operating in early November 2021, with plans to obtain more productive Bitmain S19 Pro miners from the hosting service provider in the year ending March 31, 2023 if Agora can obtain the necessary capital.
Bitcoin Mining Industry and Operations



Distributed blockchain technology is a decentralized or distributed and encrypted ledger that is designed to offer a secure, efficient, verifiable, and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. Bitcoin serves multiple purposes. It can serve as a medium of exchange, store of value or unit of account. Blockchain technologies are being evaluated for a multitude of industries due to the belief in their ability to have a significant impact in many areas of business, finance, information management, and governance. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that enables near instantaneous transfers using peer-to-peer technology with no central authority. The online network hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the blockchain, and each Bitcoin is associated with a source code that comprises the basis for the cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the blockchain. No single entity owns or operates the network. The infrastructure is collectively maintained by a decentralized public user base. Units of Bitcoin obtained from the blockchain can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, at rates determined on various exchanges, such as Coinbase, Cumberland, Bitsquare, Bitstamp, and others. Bitcoin prices are quoted on various exchanges and fluctuate with extreme volatility. See “Risk Factors” at page 27.

We believe Bitcoin offers many advantages over traditional, fiat currencies, although many of these factors also present potential disadvantages and may introduce additional risks, including acting as a fraud deterrent, immediate settlement; elimination of counterparty risk, no trusted intermediary requirement, lower transaction fees, and lack of a central authority such as a government or financial institution. However, Bitcoin may not provide all of the benefits it purports to offer.



As with many new and emerging technologies, there are potentially significant risks. Businesses (including Agora) which are seeking to develop, promote, adopt, transact or rely upon blockchain technologies and Bitcoin mining have a limited track record and operate within an untested new environment. These risks are not only related to the businesses we are pursuing, but the sector and industry, as well as the entirety of the concept behind blockchain and Bitcoin as value. Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play an important role in “mining,” which is the term for using the specialized computers in connection with the blockchain for the creation of new units of cryptocurrency. Due to regulatory uncertainty over other cryptocurrencies, we plan to mine only Bitcoin and to only expand to other cryptocurrencies, if at all, if we in consultation with legal counsel determine that such cryptocurrencies are not considered securities under the federal securities laws.



Presently, we face a period of regulatory uncertainty where the SEC led by its Chairman is seeking to expand its regulatory powers while Congress seems focused on other legislative initiatives. At the same, we believe the number of unregistered cryptocurrency offerings seems unabated despite SEC and other enforcement efforts. The result seems to be regulatory delays which have adversely affected Agora’s ability to complete its initial public offering. While the SEC Staff seems focused on striving to create accounting uniformity for Bitcoin mining companies, the slow pace has also affected the Company.



Bitstream’s business model entails operating modularized data centers, which are advanced computers referred to as “miners” capable of processing and solving blockchain algorithms. In exchange for solving the algorithm, the blockchain rewards the miner, and thereby the operator (Bitstream), a Bitcoin. Miners use electric power to mine Bitcoin by solving the algorithm at a certain processing rate, which can vary depending on the electricity deployed and the infrastructure used, as well as the quality of the miner computer used. The rate at which an algorithm is processed and solved and a Bitcoin is rewarded is referred to as the “hash rate.”



Bitstream plans to utilize the electric energy to power its energy intensive operations of Bitcoin mining. Additionally, if Texas experiences another power shortage during the winter or summer months from extreme weather conditions, Bitstream would be able to arbitrage power at favorable margins. Bitstream will do this by temporarily shutting down their Bitcoin mining operations and sell their purchased power back to the grid at favorable margins. In the winter of 2021, during the blackout, the price per kWh exceeded $10 at its peak imbalance, whereas Bitstream’s power cost is expected to be less than $0.03 per kWh.



Bitstream’s ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the price of Bitcoin. The prices of Bitcoin, have experienced substantial volatility, including fluctuation patterns which may reflect “bubble” type volatility, meaning that high or low prices at a given time may not be indicative of the current or future value of Bitcoin. The price of a Bitcoin may be subject to rapidly changing investor and market sentiment, and may be influenced by factors such as technology, regulatory developments and media coverage. Bitcoin prices have declined significantly in recent weeks creating a potential comparison to the dotcom bubble in 2000. See “Risk Factors.”

We have invested approximately $9 million in purchasing shares of common stock and advancing loans to Agora and agreed to invest an additional $5 million towards our Bitcoin mining operations in connection with multiple agreements with mining equipment sellers and service providers. These agreements consist of:




(a) | Agreement with a third party to assist in building a high-performance data center, which includes site acquisition, development and sourcing of electrical capacity of 12 MWs at a West Texas location;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | The purchase of 20 acres of land in West Texas for $250,000, of which $125,000 was reimbursed to the Company, with an option to sell back this land to the sellers at $400 per acre upon cessation of the land being used as a data center;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | The purchase of 5,000 used Canaan AvalonMiners 841 13 tera hash per second (“TH/s”) miners for $1,350,000 plus shipping costs, which have all been delivered to the West Texas data centers and are currently being operated by Bitstream;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Hosting agreement under which we have agreed to host third parties’ Bitmain Antminer S19 miners, which have higher hash rates than the used miners we deploy, at the Company’s site location, and we will receive 100% of the resulting revenue for mining production at up to the hash rate (TH/s) at which Bitmain has indicated that the miners will operate, and 65% of the mining production which exceeds that hash rate; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | Provided we can obtain the necessary capital, we may exercise our right under the hosting agreement to effect a “virtual swap” wherein we obtain the hosted miners in exchange for our provision to the hosted parties of new replacement miners that we pay for.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agora Registration Statement



For a more complete description of Bitstream’s Bitcoin mining operations and other aspects of its business and operational plans and objectives, including the principal risks Agora (and through Agora, Ecoark) faces, please refer to the Agora Registration Statement, as most recently amended on April 26, 2022.
Zest Labs, Inc.



Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Zest, the Company has developed intellectual property that can offer freshness management solutions for fresh food growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, grocers and restaurants.



Its Zest Fresh solution is a cloud-based post-harvest shelf-life and freshness management solution that improves delivered freshness of produce and protein and reduces post-harvest losses at the retailer due to temperature handling and processing by 50% or more by intelligently matching customer freshness requirements with actual product freshness. The intellectual property focuses on four primary value propositions – operational efficiency, consistent food freshness, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh can empower workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence at a pallet level. Zest also developed a Zest Delivery solution that can provide real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food.



The Zest Fresh value proposition is designed to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. Zest has never been able to monetize Zest’s intellectual property and is the plaintiff in two lawsuits. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” However, studies have shown that harvest conditions and post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness and, if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh can permit fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, with a goal of providing significant financial savings to fresh food producers and retailers. 



Zest has developed the industry’s first freshness metric called the Zest Intelligent Pallet Routing Code (“ZIPR Code”). The ZIPR Code has three main components: (i) Harvest Quality which sets total freshness capacity (for example, 12 days for strawberries), (ii) Handling Impact which reflects aging acceleration due to improper handling, and (iii) Future Handling which accurately reflects how the product will be handled (for example, store shelf temperature may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 34 degrees Fahrenheit). 





7







Zest Fresh is designed to be offered to fresh food producers, processors, distributors, restaurants and grocers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest Fresh, typically from the field harvest through retail grocery delivery. The Zest Fresh service includes a re-usable wireless Internet of Things (“IoT”) condition sensor that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field or processor through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed, using artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud-based solution, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest Fresh web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides dynamic updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness. Zest Fresh also includes integrated blockchain support to grower and shipper customers via the Zest Fresh platform. 



Zest Labs’ Zest Delivery solution is designed to help to manage prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with “instant delivery” services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods, which can potentially impact quality, value and safety. Zest Delivery can monitor and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery can provide the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery can provide automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is designed to be offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.



Our ability to execute our strategy with respect to our freshness management solutions depends in part on the outcome of the litigation related to protection of our intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for more information.



Competition



The Company faces intense competition with respect to its products and services in all markets in which it operates.



In the oil and gas industry, we are producing and selling crude oil as a commodity so we compete against all producers including individual well owners through the major global and national oil companies. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.



Agora and its subsidiaries have significant competition from larger companies with greater assets and resources, and operate within a business environment which is constantly evolving. We face significant competition in every aspect of our Bitcoin mining business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, the ability to raise capital, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry. Many of our competitors have substantially more financial resources, miners and employees.



Sales and Marketing



Through Banner and its subsidiaries, the Company sells and provides services to its customers via blanket master services agreements. Banner sells hydrocarbon to midstream energy resource providers.



The Company markets its technology products and services principally through direct sales efforts and the utilization of third-party agents.

Government Regulations 



Set forth below is an overview of the government regulations we presently face or could face as a result of our current and planned operations. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see “Risk Factors.”
Banner Midstream Corp.



Oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we operate, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi (the “Territory”), have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, states in the Territory impose a severance tax on production and sales of oil, and gas within its jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. But large companies have sufficient human capital to deal with regulation in contrast to Banner.



Our exploration and production activities are subject to a variety of rules and regulations concerning drilling permits, location, spacing and density of wells, water discharge and disposal, prevention of waste, bonding requirements, surface use and restoration, public health and environmental protection and well plugging and abandonment. In addition, our operations must comply with rules governing the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the unitization or pooling of lands and leases. Some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states, such as Texas, rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In states such as Texas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units and therefore to drill and develop our leases in circumstances where we do not own all of the leases in the proposed unit. These risks also exist in other states that have imposed limits on forced pooling. State laws may also prohibit or limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, which may impact rates of production of crude oil and natural gas from our wells. Leases covering state or federal lands often include additional laws, regulations and conditions which can limit the location, timing and number of wells we can drill and impose other requirements on our operations, all of which can increase our costs. The Company, however, only had an insignificant amount of oil and gas mineral leases on federal land owned by the Bureau of Land Management.



Federal regulation of oil and gas is also extensive. The recent spike in gasoline and other fuel costs is at least in part been driven by the Biden Administration’s efforts to reduce oil drilling and transition away from fossil fuels. Our transportation services are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials and periodic financial reporting. The transportation industry is subject to possible other regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change, security and/or occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size and a mandate to implement electronic logging devices) that may affect the economics of our transportation services by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services.



Agora



Although there was a period of regulatory uncertainty ending in 2018, we believe that the SEC will not claim that Bitcoin is a security and therefore that Bitcoin will not be subject to the SEC’s regulation. The SEC has been active in pursuing its regulation of other cryptocurrencies by filing lawsuits and, more recently, administratively against a cryptocurrency that tried to register under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Further, the SEC’s new Chairman has given a number of speeches seeking firm regulatory authority over cryptocurrencies. Whether Congress will enact new legislation in this area is uncertain, although in June 2022, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate. However, enhanced regulation may adversely affect our future Bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrency activities. Moreover, there is a risk that the SEC may seek a way to regulate Bitcoin as a security although our lawyers think the risk is not material. Very recently an opinion columnist for the Wall Street Journal implied he thought Bitcoin was a security.

Blockchain and Bitcoin are increasingly becoming subject to governmental regulation, both in the U.S. and internationally. State and local regulations also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business. For instance, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) published a report entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” in October 2020. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the possible threats and enforcement challenges the DOJ views as associated with the use and prevalence of cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory and investigatory means the DOJ has at its disposal to deal with these possible threats and challenges.



Presently, we do not believe any U.S. or state regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to Bitcoin with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability.



For example, in 2021 China banned Bitcoin mining. Additionally, lawmakers in New York recently approved legislation which would impose a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining including Bitcoin. This action, while not causing a direct impact on our current operations due to lack of a presence there, may represent the beginning of similar regulatory obstacles that could prevent or impose material additional costs on our Bitcoin mining operations, particularly if such regulations arise in Texas where we currently mine Bitcoin. See “Risk Factors” at page 30 of this Report.



Environmental Compliance



Our operations through Banner and Agora are or may become subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate change. These laws and regulations change frequently, and the effect of these changes is often to impose additional costs or other restrictions on our operations. We cannot predict the occurrence, timing, nature or effect of these changes. We also operate under a number of environmental permits and authorizations. The issuing agencies may take the position that some or all of these permits and authorizations are subject to modification, suspension, or revocation under certain circumstances, but any such action would have to comply with applicable procedures and requirements.



While we are currently not experiencing any material expenses related to the environmental compliance, we may become subject to requirements of environmental or other related laws and regulations in the future, which may result from a number of causes, including potentially as a result of our new operations mining Bitcoin and/or due to new regulations being considered. Please review the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report and the paragraph that follows with regard to potential environmental and other compliance expenses.



On March 21, 2022, the SEC released proposed rule changes on climate-related disclosure. The proposed rule changes would require registrants including the Company to include certain climate-related disclosures in registration statements and periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant’s business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements. The required information about climate-related risks also would include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions, information about climate-related targets and goals, and transition plan, if any, and requires extensive attestation requirements. The proposed new rules would also require companies to disclose multiple levels of climate impact, including primary direct impacts from the registrant’s own operations, as well as secondary and tertiary effects of the operations and uses by contractors that the registrant utilizes and end-users of the registrant’s products and/or services. If adopted as proposed, the rule changes will result in material additional compliance and reporting costs, including monitoring, collecting, analyzing and reporting the new metrics and implementing systems and procuring additional internal and external personnel with the requisite skills and expertise to serve those functions. We expect that the rules will be adopted in large part at least, and our compliance costs will be material. However, following a June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court administrative decision, we expect a court challenge to any SEC Rule. We cannot predict the outcome of any challenge.

Intellectual Property



The Company through Zest, currently holds rights to 75 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including RFID technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for “Intelleflex,” the Intelleflex logo, “Zest,” “Zest Data Services,” and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest’s products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest seeks to operate, subject to the outcome of pending litigation and financing and, are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates. 
Seasonality



Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality due to our oil and gas exploration and transportation business. Demand for oil, is typically higher in the third and fourth quarters resulting in higher prices. But higher fuel costs may adversely affect the transportations business which accounted for approximately 72% of FY 2022 revenue. See the Risk Factors on page 18. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. Seasonal weather conditions, including the annual flooding of coastal properties, and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and our trucking business. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for the drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations, thus, lowering the demand for trucking services. Also, the volatility of commodities prices and supply chain issues can potentially delay the receipt of critical parts and equipment needed during drilling projects which can both delay the project and add additional costs to the project.
Dependence on Major Customers



From time-to-time we have had and may continue to have customers generating 10 percent or more of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and loss of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.



In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, in our continuing operations, five of our customers, all in the commodity segment, accounted for a total of 75% of our accounts receivable, and one customer accounted for 61% of our total revenues.



Human Capital Resources



As of the date of this Report, we have 50 full-time employees, 1 part-time employee and 109 owner-operator truck drivers.



Our ability to successfully execute our strategic initiatives is highly dependent on recruiting and retaining skilled personnel and qualified drivers. Our compensation philosophy is based on incentivizing and rewarding performance, with alignment of individual, corporate, and stockholder interests. Compensation includes salaries, benefits, and equity participation. Our owner operator drivers are not salaried employees.



We are committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and drivers. We follow applicable local, state, and federal laws, regulations, and guidance.



Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to ensure that all employees maintain the highest standards of business conduct in every aspect of their dealings with each other, customers, suppliers, vendors, service providers, stockholders, and governmental authorities.



We believe our relations with our employees and drivers are satisfactory.



Proposed Spin-Offs



Subject to completion of the Agora public offering and Nasdaq uplisting described above, the Company intends to issue a stock dividend through a pro rata distribution of Agora’s common stock to the Company’s common shareholders and holders of common stock equivalents. The Company plans to distribute 80% of the Agora common stock it holds to its shareholders as of a future record date to be determined upon completion of regulatory compliance. The Company plans to retain its remaining ownership in Agora on its balance sheet until a later date. As a result of the approval by the Board of Directors of the Company to divest Agora, the Company has accounted for this as a disposal other than by sale. Assets to be disposed of other than by sale should continue to be classified as held and used until they are disposed of.



Following the 80% stock dividend of Agora, Ecoark plans to also distribute its ownership of Banner, White River, Zest and the remaining Agora shares to its shareholders. At some point, Ecoark expects that BitNile or an affiliate will present a reverse merger candidate to it which will prevent Ecoark from becoming a shell or losing its Nasdaq listing. However, the parties have only engaged in very preliminary discussions. What the acquisition target will be and what the consideration will be has not been discussed. The Ecoark Board of Directors intends to obtain a valuation from a nationally recognized valuation firm and advice from investment bankers consistent with the exercise of their fiduciary duty.



To date, discussions between BitNile have centered upon Ecoark being able to spin-off to its shareholders each of our subsidiaries. Other than the initial spin-off of 80% of Agora within six months of Agora’s closing of its initial public offering, the timing of the remaining spin-offs as well as any acquisition of another business is uncertain. Our current plans are to expedite the spin-offs and complete them by June 2023. In order to avoid the harsh terms of the Warrant issued to the BitNile subsidiary, we expect that the spin-offs will occur on or before June 7, 2024. BitNile files reports with the SEC which investors are encouraged to review at www.SEC.gov/EDGAR, which reports are not incorporated herein by reference.
