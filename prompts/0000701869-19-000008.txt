ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Independence Holding Company is a Delaware corporation (NYSE: IHC) that was formed in 1980. We are a holding company principally engaged in the life and health insurance business with principal executive offices located at 96 Cummings Point Road, Stamford, Connecticut 06902. 

Our website is located at www.ihcgroup.com. Detailed information about IHC, its corporate affiliates and insurance products and services can be found on our website. In addition, we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to such reports available, free of charge, through our website, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information on our website, however, is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission amended the definition of a smaller reporting company to expand the number of smaller companies eligible to comply with scaled disclosure requirements. Under the new definition, a company with a public float less than $250 million is eligible to provide scaled disclosures. IHC qualified for smaller reporting company status and has elected to use the scaled disclosure accommodations in this annual report and subsequent filings.
 
Since the sale of its stop loss business in 2016, IHC has been primarily known as an underwriter of specialty health and disability products through its three carriers, Standard Security Life Insurance Company of New York ("Standard Security Life"), Madison National Life Insurance Company, Inc. ("Madison National Life") and Independence American Insurance Company (“Independence American”). Standard Security Life focuses on underwriting and selling its New York short-term disability (“DBL”) and paid family leave rider (“PFL”) products through general agents primarily to small employers. Madison National Life emphasizes underwriting long-term disability and group life primarily to school districts and municipalities in the Upper Midwest through a managing general agent and independent brokers, and is establishing a worksite marketing division. Independence American is our primary specialty health and pet underwriter. Madison National Life, Standard Security Life and Independence American are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Insurance Group." IHC and its subsidiaries (including the Insurance Group) are sometimes collectively referred to as the "Company", or "IHC", or are implicit in the terms "we", "us" and "our".

We have three business segments: Specialty Health segment; Group disability, life, DBL and PFL segment; and our individual life, annuities and other segment.
 
The Specialty Health Segment is comprised of premiums from policies underwritten by IHC’s carriers as well as commission and fee income earned by our agencies for selling products from IHC’s insurance companies as well as unaffiliated carriers. While our carriers have distributed in a variety of manners to individuals and small employers, including through dedicated controlled distribution, we have primarily relied on independent producers, national accounts and white-label relationships. In general, companies that provide insurance through user-centric platforms, or create efficiencies in the insurance industry through technological advances, are referred to as “insuretech” companies. As further described in Outlook, we are increasingly focused on expanding our “insuretech” footprint through our agencies, which generate leads and sell through our owned call center and career advisors. IHC’s insurance companies sell the following products: (i) ancillary benefits including dental, vision, short-term medical (“STM”), supplemental products including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity (“HIP”); (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) non-subscriber occupational accident and injured on duty. The segment includes run-off of a limited amount of discontinued major medical coverage and occupational accident 

from one producer that was sold in 2017. The Insurance Group and certain of their affiliates collectively perform marketing, sales, underwriting and certain administrative functions on the majority of our Specialty Health business. Several third party administrators perform claims and other administrative functions. 
 
The Specialty Health Segment performs underwriting, risk selection and pricing, policy administration and management of the majority of our specialty health business, which totaled approximately $186.5 million of gross individual and group health premiums in 2018. In addition, our Agencies produce other coverages for multiple insurers including producing small group stop-loss. Gross earned premiums produced by our Agencies was approximately $197.1 million in 2018.
 
In 2019, IHC will retain the vast majority of the risk that it underwrites, and will focus on the following lines of business:

Multiple specialty health lines including pet insurance

Group disability, life and DBL and PFL

Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American are each rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("Best"). Standard Security Life is domiciled in New York and licensed as an insurance company in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Madison National Life is domiciled in Wisconsin, licensed to sell insurance products in 49 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. Independence American is domiciled in Delaware and licensed to sell insurance products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We have been informed by Best that a Best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company's financial condition and operating performance and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries, and is not directed toward protection of investors. Best ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our securities. 

Our administrative companies underwrite, market, administer and/or price life and health insurance business for our owned and affiliated carriers, and, to a lesser extent, for non-affiliated insurance companies. They receive fees for these services and do not bear any of the insurance risk of the companies to which they provide services, other than through profit commissions. Specialty Benefits is a technology-driven full-service marketing and distribution company that focuses on small employer and individual consumer products through general agents, tele-brokerages, advisor centers, private label arrangements, and through the following brands: www.HealtheDeals.com; Health eDeals Advisors; www.PetPartners.com; and www.PetPlace.com. On January 4, 2019, the Company acquired My1HR, Inc. (“My1HR”) a Web-Based Entity that develops quoting and cloud based enrollment platforms. The Insurance Group and certain of its affiliates perform program management, actuarial, regulatory compliance, product development and implementation, and valuation services for IHC’s specialty health segment. IHC owns controlling interests in Global Accident Facilities, LLC (“GAF”), Healthinsurance.org LLC (“HIO”) and PetPartners, Inc. (“PetPartners”). GAF is a holding company for an agency that produces injured on duty business. HIO is an online marketing company that owns www.healthinsurance.org, a lead generation site for individual health insurance. PetPartners is the exclusive provider of pet insurance to the American Kennel Club and the Cat Fanciers Association. Specialty Benefits, GAF, HIO and PetPartners are collectively referred to as our “Agencies.” Our Agencies earn commissions for selling life and health insurance products underwritten by IHC’s owned and affiliated insurance companies and also by unaffiliated carriers. IHC also owns a significant equity interest in Ebix Health Exchange Holdings, LLC (“Ebix Health Exchange”), an administration exchange for health insurance. Ebix Health Exchange administers various lines of health insurance for IHC and non-affiliated carriers through Ebix Health Administration Exchange, Inc. (“EHAE”).
    For information pertaining to the Company's business segments, reference is made to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. 

Our Philosophy
 
Our business strategy has focused on maximizing underwriting profits through a variety of niche specialty health insurance, pet, and group disability and life products and through distribution channels that enable us to access specialized or underserved markets in which we believe we have a competitive advantage. Historically, our carriers have focused on establishing preferred relationships with producers who seek an alternative to larger, more bureaucratic health insurers, and on providing these producers with personalized service, competitive compensation and a broad array of products. In 2017 and 2018, several large health insurers marketed a significant amount of our ancillary health products to supplement or in lieu of their major medical products. We have recently begun to emphasize sales directly-to-consumers through our call center, career advisors and website. While our management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning and decision-making, underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as the primary goal in all decisions.
 
As further described in Outlook, our goal for the next two years is to maximize the valuation of IHC by expanding on its existing “insuretech” capabilities to generate sales directly to consumers through our call center, career advisors and website, while continuing our emphasis on higher-margin specialty health products. 
 


DISTRIBUTION
------------

Specialty Health 
 
IHC distributes its specialty health products in a variety of ways. We distribute directly to consumers through our call centers, career advisors and www.heathedeals.com. Our call centers currently employ 44 sales agents in three locations. One of these offices is dedicated to servicing calls from members of USAA, while the others sell based on leads generated organically or purchased. The core products sold by these agents are IHC’s STM and HIP as well as Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) plans underwritten by other carriers. Consumers often also purchase ancillary products, including dental, accident, telemedicine and Rx discounts plans, with a core plan. In 2019, we anticipate that we will also sell senior products through our call centers, including Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage, dental, vision and HIP products designed for seniors. IHC distributes through our career advisors model. These are licensed 1099 agents who primarily sell IHC products. We typically provide them with leads (which they either “purchase” or “earn” through IHC production), but they are also expected to generate their own leads. IHC has used this distribution model for over ten years, and we expect to significantly enhance this distribution in 2019. Finally, we sell directly to consumers through www.healthedeals.com.
 
IHC also distributes through independent producers in the following ways: (i) through our four regional sales directors who support non-owned general agents, (ii) through national account relationships such as Anthem, United Health as well as single state Blue Cross organizations and regional health plans, and (iii) through our 12 sales telebrokerage employees who function as company-owned general agents calling upon independent agents who have a book of business (often Property & Casualty) with small employers. Our employees earn production bonuses for assisting the agent in placing the health sale with IHC or our carrier partners. The lead product for the owned general agents is small group stop-loss underwritten by Westport Insurance Corporation, although they also sell our individual and group products. The regional sales directors and national account relationships focus on individual health products. We believe that the purchase of My1HR in 2019 will greatly enhance the ability of all of our distributors to increase their sale of both small group and individual products. The Trump Administration has announced its intent to adopt regulations that will allow HRA dollars that employers have contributed on a pre-tax basis to be used by employees to purchase STM as well as Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) plans. Through the proprietary My1HR exchange platform, small employers will be given the option to offer their employees benefits through any of the following: (i) a self-funded employer sponsored plan, (ii) a fully insured small group plan (e.g. Anthem would be the carrier), or (iii) an HRA funded by the employer with 

pre-tax dollars that the employee could spend on either an ACA or STM policy. The My1HR platform provides all of these choices as well as an enrollment tool to the employees with little to no effort on the part of the employer. In addition to health insurance, IHC’s other products would be readily available for purchase including disability, dental, critical illness and accident plans.
 
We distribute our pet insurance in three ways: (i) through PetPartners, where IHC distributes, administers and underwrites the risk, (ii) through three significant pet administrators where IHC only underwrites the risk, and (iii) where an unaffiliated entity is responsible for sales and marketing, and IHC administers and underwrites the risk. In 2017, we acquired 85% of the equity of PetPartners, which is a pet insurance producer that has an exclusive distribution relationship with The American Kennel Club (“AKC”), and has a strong IT platform. Since that acquisition, we have seen steady improvement in the number of leads generated from the AKC and the conversion ratio, but we believe we can do even better in 2019. In addition, PetPartners is seeking other internally controlled distribution channels. In 2018, PetPartners was also successful in partnering with a new distributor of pet insurance to use our platform to administrate, on Independence American paper, business that they generate. We view partnering in this manner with distributors who are already in the pet space and want to expand into selling pet insurance to be a very promising growth opportunity in 2019. In 2019, we plan to rebuild the website for PetPlace.com, which we acquired in 2016, and we expect to improve lead generation from this domain. PetPlace.com attracted over 15 million visitors in 2018 with more than 10,000 veterinarian-approved articles and has an opted-in subscriber database of over 500,000 users responsive to marketing messaging on pet insurance as well as other pet health products. The majority of Independence American’s pet business is distributed by a pet administrator in which we have a small equity investment. 
 
 In 2018, we entered into an agreement with another independent pet insurance distributor/administrator that has a significant block of premiums. They began selling on Independence American paper in late 2018, after we received approvals for a new pet policy for this company, and expect these sales to accelerate in 2019 as we receive additional state approvals.
 
Except for licensed agents who are employed in IHC's call center, most agents and brokers who produce the Specialty Health business are non-salaried contractors who receive commissions. 

Disability and Life Products
 
Our disability and life products are primarily distributed by general agents, agents and brokers. The short-term statutory disability benefit product, including the paid family leave benefits, in New York State is marketed primarily through independent general agents who are paid commissions based upon the amount of premiums produced. Madison National Life's disability and group life products are primarily sold in the Upper Midwest to school districts, municipalities and hospital employer groups through a managing general agent that specializes in these target markets. Independence American also reinsured health products serving the needs of expatriates, third-party nationals and high net-worth local nationals, which is now in run out. The Abacus Group LLC, a 44% owned equity investment of the Company, specializes in worksite marketing of voluntary benefits and is producing life and disability business for Madison National Life.

Medical Stop-Loss
 
Standard Security Life was the primary carrier for our employer medical stop-loss products although, in 2016, we also wrote business for Madison National Life, Independence American and unaffiliated carriers. IHC’s carriers wrote the vast majority of their medical stop-loss business through Risk Solutions, which was sold on March 31, 2016, and TRU Services, LLC. IHC owned two managing general underwriters (“MGUs”), Majestic Underwriters, LLC and Alliance Underwriters, LLC, which transferred their stop-loss blocks and employees to Risk Solutions as of January 1, 2012 in exchange for fee income based on the business transferred. These two MGUs were liquidated in 2016 as a result of the Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction. Risk Solutions was responsible for underwriting accounts in accordance 

with guidelines formulated and approved by its carriers, billing and collecting premiums, paying commissions to agents, third party administrators and/or brokers, and processing claims. With respect to the MGUs with which we did business, we established underwriting guidelines, maintained approved policy forms and oversaw claims for reimbursement, as well as appropriate accounting procedures and reserves. In order to accomplish this, we audited their underwriting, claims and policy issuance practices to assure compliance with our guidelines, provided them with access to our medical management and cost containment expertise, and reviewed cases that required referral based on our underwriting guidelines. MGUs are non-salaried contractors that receive fee income, generally a percentage of gross premiums produced by them on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent, and typically are entitled to additional income based on underwriting results. The Insurance Group has now ceased writing medical stop-loss business. 
 
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS
 
Specialty Health Products
 
In 2018, this line of business had the following categories: (i) ancillary benefits, including dental, vision, STM, and supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity); (ii) pet insurance; and (iii) non-subscriber occupational accident. This category also includes reinsured international health plans sold to expatriates although this business is now in runoff. Net earned premium attributable to specialty health products increased from $181.9 million in 2017 to $184.5 million in 2018. Earned premium is expected to increase again in 2019 due to: increased sales of short-term medical, new sales of employer sponsored and voluntary health plans and the continued growth of our owned call centers.
Ancillary Products
 
This category is primarily comprised of dental, vision, STM, supplemental products (including fixed indemnity limited benefit, critical illness, and hospital indemnity). These are sold through multiple distribution strategies as described above.
 
IHC sells group and individual dental products in all 50 states. The dental portfolio includes indemnity and PPO plans for employer groups of two or more lives and for individuals within affinity groups. Employer plans are offered on both employer paid and voluntary basis. As part of the distribution of our dental products, we also offer vision benefits. Vision plans will offer a flat reimbursement amount for exams and materials. We expect to see a growth in vision sales primarily due to new distribution partnerships.
    IHC sells STM products in the majority of states. STM is designed specifically for people with temporary needs for health coverage. Typically, STM products are written for a defined duration of at least 30 days and less than twelve months. Among the typical purchasers of STM products are people who are in between open enrollment periods or need coverage for a limited duration until their ACA-compliant plan becomes effective, and others who need insurance for a specified period of time. Our STM plans contain many, but not all, of the essential health benefits (“EHB”) found in ACA-compliant plans. In addition, our STM plans often have lower deductibles and broader networks than many ACA-compliant policies, and are almost always more affordable for qualified purchasers. IHC’s gross premium decreased in this line of business in 2018 largely as a result of a ruling which limited STM to plans of 90 days duration or less. Effective October 1, 2018, an executive order from the Trump Administration reversed the previous executive order and restored the decision on the duration of STM to the states. We anticipate growth in this line of business in 2019 in states that allow durations of 6 months or more, however, a number of states have recently moved to severely curtail the ability of carriers to sell STM in their states.
 
The Company markets supplemental products to individuals and families. These lines of business are generally used as either a supplement or in lieu of an ACA-compliant plan. The main driver for growth 

in this line is that consumers are moving to higher-cost sharing on their individual major medical plans, and are looking for products to help them offset the additional risk of higher deductibles and out of pocket limits. The product lines included in this supplemental grouping are hospital indemnity plans, fixed indemnity limited benefit plans, critical illness and bundled packages of accident medical coverage, critical illness and life insurance. These products, which are available in most states, are available through multiple distribution sources including Company owned direct-to-consumer websites, call center and career agents, general agents and on-line agencies. In 2017, we introduced several bundled benefit packages that include STM, HIP, dental and a tele-med and Rx benefit. These are being sold by Company owned direct-to-consumer websites, call center and career agents, and some national accounts. We anticipate growth in these lines of business in 2019 as a result of increased distribution and demand for these products, and elimination of the individual mandate.
 
IHC has medical benefit plans for employers that choose to offer non-EHB coverage to their employees. We offer a fixed indemnity limited benefit policy that offers affordable health coverage to hourly, part-time and/or seasonal employees, which is approved in a majority of states. Fixed indemnity limited benefit plans are a low-cost alternative to EHB plans that permit employees who do not otherwise have health insurance to begin to participate in the healthcare system. The Company anticipates meaningful growth in this line of business in 2019 due to increased consumer demand and increased distribution channels. 
 
Pet Insurance
 
Independence American has products approved to sells in all 50 states including DC. We use three distinct forms (policies) to achieve diversity of premium targeting channels focused on purebred puppies (through AKC), shelter/rescue/animal welfare markets, direct to consumer, and affiliate partnerships. In 2019, we expect to expand our reach into the employer market and are currently in talks with brokers controlling the benefits relationships for mega-sized employers. We believe an advantage in our product design is flexibility allowing for consumers to build plans of coverage tailored to their needs and budget by offering an array of deductible and coinsurance options and the availability of unlimited policy “maximum” levels. In our owned distribution product, we embed alternative, holistic and behavioral coverage benefits (these are popular with the veterinary channel and we are market leading in providing behavioral coverage), two levels of wellness options (many competitors do not cover wellness and preventative), hereditary and congenital conditions coverage, as well as the option to have veterinary exam fees covered as a benefit (one of the leading pet insurance providers today specifically excludes exam fees). In 2019 we anticipate significant growth in our target channels due to increased consumer awareness of the product category, new distribution partnerships, as well as improved conversion rates through our AKC and lead generation avenues.
Occupational Accident
 
In 2018, most of IHC’s occupational accident insurance had been written by Independence American through marketing and administrative companies previously owned by GAF, and other exclusive arrangements with independent entities. This occupational accident product provides accidental death, accident disability and accident medical benefits for occupational injuries to employees of companies that have elected to not participate in the Texas Worker’s Compensation system (non-subscribers). The product also gives the employer the option to purchase coverage for employer’s liability, which protects the employer from an action brought by an injured worker. The employer is covered for damages and costs arising from the settlement of such action, subject to the terms and limits of the policy. In 2016, GAF sold the entity that provided administrative services for occupational accident insurance. Independence American still offers Injured on Duty coverage through another subsidiary of GAF and IHC continues to write a smaller block of occupational accident coverage through unaffiliated entities. As a result of the aforementioned sale, total premiums are expected to remain relatively constant in 2019. 


Group Disability, Life, DBL and PFL
 
Group Long-Term and Short-Term Disability

The Company sells group long-term disability ("LTD") products to employers that wish to provide this benefit to their employees. Depending on an employer's requirements, LTD policies (i) cover between 40% and 90% of insurable salary; (ii) have elimination periods (i.e., the period between the commencement of the disability and the start of benefit payments) of between 30 and 730 days; and (iii) terminate after two, five, or ten years, or extend to age 65 or the employee's Social Security normal retirement date. Benefit payments are reduced by social security, workers’ compensation, pension benefits and other income replacement payments. Optional benefits are available to employees, including coverage for partial or residual disabilities, survivor benefits and cost of living adjustments. The Company also markets short-term disability ("STD") policies that provide a weekly benefit to disabled employees until the earlier of: recovery from disability, eligibility for long-term disability benefits or the end of the STD benefit period. We continue our efforts to expand our position in the worksite market with new product filings and administration/distribution partners to position us for growth in 2019 and beyond. We have developed relationships with large health carriers to provide our life and disability programs. We are also negotiating with union-based entities to continue to leverage our strengths, namely overall risk management for disability programs in a benefit-rich and complex environment. The Company anticipates moderate growth in 2019.

New York Short-Term Disability and Paid Family Leave
 
Standard Security Life markets DBL. All companies with more than one employee in New York State are required to provide DBL insurance for their employees. DBL coverage provides temporary cash payments to replace wages lost as a result of disability due to non-occupational injury or illness. The DBL policy provides for (i) payment of 50% of salary to a maximum of $170 per week; (ii) a maximum of 26 weeks in a consecutive 52-week period; and (iii) benefit commencement on the eighth consecutive day of disability. Policies covering fewer than 50 employees have fixed rates approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”). Policies covering 50 or more employees are individually underwritten. 

As of January 1, 2018 the DBL policy was amended to include PFL. The PFL benefit allows for parent bonding with a newborn or an adopted child, caring for a seriously ill family members and to help military families during times of need. Beginning January 1, 2018, with incremental changes until 2021, the benefit will be phased in. The maximum benefit (once completely phased in starting January 1, 2021) will be for 12 weeks at 67% of an employees’ weekly wage up to a maximum benefit of $869 per week. The PFL premium rate is set by the NYSDFS. In addition to mandating this benefit, the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program so that all carriers would share on a pro rata basis in the ultimate profit or loss of the PFL business across three group sizes for the entire industry. The goal of the PFL risk adjustment program is to protect issuers from disproportionate adverse or favorable risks that might arise because PFL premium rates are community rated and not allowed to vary by risk factors. 
 
Group Term Life
 
The Company sells group term life products, including group term life, accidental death and dismemberment ("AD&D"), supplemental life and supplemental AD&D and dependent life. As with its group disability business, IHC anticipates modest growth in this line of business through expansion of its sales of these group term life products through existing distribution sources. 

Medical Stop-Loss
 
The Company was a leading writer nationally of excess or stop-loss insurance for self-insured employer groups that desire to manage the risk of large medical claims. Medical Stop-Loss insurance 

provides coverage to public and private entities that elect to self-insure their employees' medical coverage for losses within specified ranges, which permits such groups to manage the risk of excessive health insurance costs by limiting specific and aggregate losses to predetermined amounts. This coverage is available on either a specific or a specific and aggregate basis, although the majority of the Insurance Group's policies covered both specific and aggregate claims. Plans were designed to fit the identified needs of the self-insured employer by offering a variety of deductibles (i.e., the level of claims after which the medical stop-loss benefits become payable).
 
The Risk Solutions Sale and Coinsurance Transaction closed on March 31, 2016 and as a result, this line is in run-off and had substantially reduced premiums in 2017 and no premiums in 2018. 
 
Individual Life, Annuities and Other
 
Madison National Life ceased writing individual life and annuity policies in 2015 and the remaining policies in runoff are 100% ceded.
   The following lines of Standard Security Life's in-force business are in runoff: individual accident and health, individual life (of which a significant portion is 100% ceded), single premium immediate annuities, disability income and miscellaneous insurance business.
ACQUISITIONS OF POLICY BLOCKS
-----------------------------



IHC’s acquisition group was focused on potential acquisitions of existing blocks of long-term and short-term disability policies, group life policies, and specialty health policies from other insurance companies, guaranty associations and liquidators. We are not actively seeking policy block acquisitions.
 

REINSURANCE AND POLICY RETENTIONS
---------------------------------



IHC retained approximately 99% and 97% of gross and assumed Specialty Health exposure in 2018 and 2017. As of January 1, 2016, all of the in-force stop-loss business of Standard Security Life and Independence American produced by Risk Solutions was co-insured. 

The Company purchases quota share reinsurance and excess reinsurance in amounts deemed appropriate by its risk committee. The Company monitors its retention amounts by product line, and has the ability to adjust its retention as appropriate.

Reinsurance is used to reduce the potentially adverse financial impact of large individual or group risks, and to reduce the strain on statutory income and surplus related to new business. By using reinsurance, the Insurance Group is able to write policies in amounts larger than it could otherwise accept. The amount reinsured is the portion of each policy in excess of the retention limit on a particular policy. 
 
The following reinsurers represent approximately 91% of the total ceded premium for the year ended December 31, 2018:
 

RGA Reinsurance Company | 52%
-----------------------------------------+----
National Guardian Life Insurance Company | 35%
Guggenheim Life and Annuity Company | 4% 
 | 91%



The Insurance Group remains liable with respect to the insurance in-force, which has been reinsured in the unlikely event that the assuming reinsurers are unable to satisfy their obligations. The Insurance Group cedes business (i) to individual reinsurance companies that are rated "A-" or better by Best or (ii) 

upon provision of adequate security. The ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Insurance Group's ceded reinsurance in-force was $7.5 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively.
 
For information pertaining to reinsurance, reference is made to Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.


INVESTMENTS AND RESERVES
------------------------



The Company's cash, cash equivalents and securities portfolio are managed by employees of IHC and its affiliates, and ultimate investment authority rests with IHC's in-house investment group. As a result of the nature of IHC's insurance liabilities, IHC endeavors to maintain a significant percentage of its assets in investment grade securities, cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2018, 99.3% of the fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA. The internal investment group provides a summary of the investment portfolio and the performance thereof at the meetings of the Company's board of directors.
   As required by insurance laws and regulations, the Insurance Group establishes reserves to meet obligations on policies in-force. These reserves are amounts that, with additions from premiums expected to be received and with interest on such reserves at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet anticipated future policy obligations. Premiums and reserves are based upon certain assumptions with respect to mortality, morbidity on health insurance, lapses and interest rates effective at the time the polices are issued. The Insurance Group also establishes appropriate reserves for substandard business, annuities and additional policy benefits, such as waiver of premium and accidental death. Standard Security Life and Madison National Life are also required by law to have an annual asset adequacy analysis, which, in general, projects the amount and timing of cash flows to the estimated maturity date of liabilities, prepared by the certifying actuary for each insurance company. The Insurance Group invests their respective assets, which support the reserves and other funds in accordance with applicable insurance law, under the supervision of their respective board of directors. The Company manages interest rate risk seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities. The Company occasionally utilizes options to modify the duration and average life of the assets. 

Under Wisconsin insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. With respect to the portion of an insurer's assets equal to its liabilities plus a statutorily-determined security surplus amount, a Wisconsin insurer cannot, for example, invest more than a certain percentage of its assets in non-amortizable evidences of indebtedness, securities of any issuer and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary and the United States government), or common stock of any corporation and its affiliates (other than a subsidiary or mutual funds).

Under New York insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. For example, a New York life insurer cannot invest more than a certain percentage of its admitted assets in common or preferred shares of any one institution, obligations secured by any one property (other than those issued, guaranteed or insured by the United States or any state government or agency thereof), or medium and lower grade obligations. In addition, there are certain qualitative investment restrictions.    
Under Delaware insurance law, there are restrictions relating to the percentage of an insurer's admitted assets that may be invested in a specific issuer or in the aggregate in a particular type of investment. In addition, there are qualitative investment restrictions.


The Company's total pre-tax investment performance for each of the last two years is summarized below, including amounts recognized in net income and unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income or loss (in thousands): 
 

 | | 2018 | | 2017 
-----------------------------------------------------------+---+---------+---+-------
Consolidated Statements of Income: | | | | 
Net investment income | $ | 15,021 | $ | 14,430
Net investment gains (losses) | | (1,033) | | 2,539 
Other-than-temporary impairments | | - | | - 
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss): | | | | 
Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities | | (4,272) | | 4,996 
Total pre-tax investment performance | $ | 9,716 | $ | 21,965

 
Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities recognized through other comprehensive income (loss) represents the pre-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities arising during the year net of reclassification adjustments and includes the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests. In 2017, the Company classified certain equity securities as available-for-sale and changes to the fair value of those equity securities classified as available-for-sale were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Upon the adoption of new accounting guidance on January 1, 2018, the Company: (i) recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to reclassify the existing amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income on that date for equity securities previously classified as available-for-sale, to retained earnings; and (ii) recorded the subsequent changes in the fair value of those equity securities in net investment gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company does not have any non-performing fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2018.


COMPETITION AND REGULATION
--------------------------



We compete with many large mutual and stock insurance companies, small regional health insurers and managed care organizations. Mutual companies may have certain competitive advantages since profits inure directly to the benefit of the policyholders. 

The health insurance industry tends to be cyclical. During a “soft” market cycle, a larger number of companies offer insurance on a certain line of business, which causes premiums in that line to trend downward. In a “hard” market cycle, insurance companies limit their writings in certain lines of business following periods of excessive losses and insurance and reinsurance companies redeploy their capital to lines that they believe will achieve higher margins. 
 
IHC is an insurance holding company; and as such, IHC and its subsidiary carriers and administrative companies are subject to regulation and supervision by multiple state insurance regulators, including the NYSDFS (Standard Security Life's domestic regulator), the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (Madison National Life's domestic regulator) and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (Independence American’s domestic regulator). Each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American is subject to regulation and supervision in every state in which it is licensed to transact business. These supervisory agencies have broad administrative powers with respect to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business, the licensing of agents, the approval of policy forms, the approval of commission rates, the form and content of mandatory financial statements, reserve requirements and the types and maximum amounts of investments which may be made. Such regulation is primarily designed for the benefit of policyholders rather than the stockholders of an insurance company or insurance holding company.

Certain transactions within the IHC holding company system are also subject to regulation and supervision by such regulatory agencies. All such transactions must be fair and equitable. Notice to or 
prior approval by the applicable insurance department is required with respect to transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions, including dividend declarations, between an insurer and any person in its holding company system. Under New York, Wisconsin and Delaware insurance laws, "control" is defined as the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person. Under New York law, control is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds, with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In Wisconsin, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote more than ten percent of the voting securities of another person. In Delaware, control is presumed if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds with the power to vote ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. In all three states, the acquisition of control of a domestic insurer needs to be approved in advance by the Commissioner of Insurance. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for information as to restrictions on the ability of the Company's insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends.
 
Risk-based capital requirements are imposed on life, accident and health and property and casualty insurance companies. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by dividing an insurance company's total adjusted capital, as defined, by its authorized control level risk-based capital. Companies that do not meet certain minimum standards require specified corrective action. The risk-based capital ratios for each of Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American exceed such minimum ratios.
