Overview 
 
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative products for the treatment of urological diseases. We are headquartered in San Diego, California and our common shares currently trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market. We are currently developing topsalysin (PRX302) as a treatment for clinically significant localized prostate cancer and as a treatment for the lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, commonly referred to as an enlarged prostate. Topsalysin, a first-in-class, pore-forming protein, is a highly ablative agent that is selective and targeted in that it is only activated by enzymatically active prostate specific antigen, or PSA, which is found in high concentrations around prostate tumor cells and in the transition zone of the prostate. In 2004, we licensed exclusive rights to topsalysin from UVIC Industry Partnerships Inc., or UVIC, and The Johns Hopkins University, or Johns Hopkins, for the treatment of prostate cancer and in 2009, we licensed exclusive rights to topsalysin from UVIC and Johns Hopkins for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH. In April 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kissei Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or Kissei, pursuant to which we granted Kissei the right to develop and commercialize topsalysin in Japan for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH, prostate cancer, prostatitis or other diseases of the prostate.
 
Topsalysin, a genetically modified recombinant protein, is delivered via ultrasound-guided injection directly into the prostate. This membrane-disrupting protein is selectively activated by enzymatically active PSA, which is found in high concentrations around prostate tumor cells and in the transition zone of the prostate, leading to localized cell death and tissue disruption without damage to neighboring tissue and nerves. This targeted method of administration limits potential for systemic exposure of topsalysin, together with topsalysin’s specific mechanism of action, (activation only by enzymatically active PSA found within the prostate. PSA in circulation is no longer enzymatically active) is thought to contribute to the tolerability and safety profile observed to date.
 
We have recently completed a multicenter, open-label Phase 2b clinical trial to confirm the dose and optimize the delivery of topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer. The study utilized commercially available software to co-register previously obtained multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, or mpMRI, images of a patient’s prostate to real time 3D ultrasound images to target the delivery of topsalysin directly into and around a pre-identified clinically significant tumor. A clinically significant tumor that warranted treatment was defined as either a Gleason score 6 (pattern 3+3) and greater than or equal to 6 mm up to 10 mm, Maximum Cancer Core Length, or MCCL, or a Gleason score 7 (pattern 3+4 or 4+3) and lesser than or equal to 10 mm MCCL. The Gleason grading system is used to provide a prognosis of the identified cancer by assigning a Gleason Score and pattern. A high Gleason score indicates aggressive cancer, with a Gleason Score 6 generally representing low risk disease, Gleason 7 intermediate risk and Gleason 8-10 high risk disease.

The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single administration of topsalysin, when used to focally ablate a histologically-proven, clinically significant lesion in patients with low-to-intermediate localized prostate cancer. A total of 38 patients with a pre-identified clinically significant lesion received a single administration of topsalysin at eight clinical trial sites located in the United Kingdom and United States. A review of the safety data from 38 patients, indicates that a single administration of topsalysin continues to appear safe and well-tolerated by patients. Adverse events considered related to topsalysin were typically mild and typically occurred and resolved within one day of the administration. In addition, urine function was preserved, there was no sexual dysfunction, no hypersensitivity reactions or other serious systemic reactions considered related to topsalysin after a single administration. 
 
A secondary objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a single administration of topsalysin to selectively target and focally ablate a pre-identified lesion. Six months after the administration of topsalysin, 37 out of 38 patients underwent a targeted biopsy of the treated lesion with one patient having been lost to follow-up following re-location. The six-month biopsy results demonstrated that 27% of patients (10/37) achieved a clinical response, defined in this trial as no detectable tumor on targeted biopsy of the treated lesion or a sufficient reduction to deem the lesion clinically-insignificant (cancer lesion of Gleason Score 6 (pattern 3+3) and a maximum cancer core length, or MCCL, of less than 6 millimeters).
 
We believe the safety and biopsy data from the first administration of topsalysin supports moving forward with a single Phase 3 registration trial using a single administration of topsalysin. We expect to obtain regulatory guidance on our design for a Phase 3 registration trial in the first half of 2019.
 
Another important objective for this Phase 2b clinical trial was to evaluate for the first time the safety of re-administering topsalysin, and to determine if additional clinical benefit could be observed, as assessed by targeted biopsy six months after a second administration of topsalysin. To be eligible to receive a second administration, patients must not have experienced any clinically-significant adverse events attributable to either topsalysin or the injection procedure. Additionally, patients must have demonstrated evidence of a response to the first treatment with topsalysin, either through a reduction in lesion size, Gleason pattern, or MCCL. No patients who had a complete ablation following the first dose received a second administration.
 
A review of the safety data from a total of eleven patients who received a second administration indicates that a second dose appears to be both safe and well-tolerated by patients. There were no adverse events considered related to topsalysin that were experienced by more than one patient following the second administration. The adverse events that were considered related to topsalysin were typically mild and resolved within two days. Importantly, no hypersensitivity reaction or other serious systemic reactions to topsalysin were observed. Urine function was preserved and there were no reports of sexual dysfunction related to topsalysin. As previously reported, one patient who received a second dose unfortunately experienced a serious adverse event of sudden cardiac death which, following a thorough review of medical records, serology results and autopsy findings, was considered unlikely related to topsalysin or the injection procedure by both the investigator and us.
 
Based on the review of the six-month biopsy results following the second administration of topsalysin, we have concluded that there appears to be no additional clinical benefit gained with a second administration as given in the Phase 2b trial. We are reviewing the decision to include a second administration of topsalysin in any future clinical studies.
 
We have also completed the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials that we believe would be required to obtain marketing approval for topsalysin for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH. In October 2013, we initiated our first Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the “PLUS-1” trial, of topsalysin for the treatment of the lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH. The Phase 3 “PLUS-1” trial was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and vehicle-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intraprostatic administration of topsalysin (0.6 µg/g prostate) for the treatment of the lower urinary symptoms of BPH. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either topsalysin or vehicle-only injection, and then monitored for one year. A total of 479 patients with moderate to severe BPH were enrolled and randomized by September 2014. On November 10, 2015, we announced final results from this trial. Topsalysin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score, or IPSS, total score from baseline over 12 months compared to the vehicle-only control group (7.60 vs. 6.58 point overall improvement; p = 0.043), the primary endpoint of the trial. IPSS is a patient recorded, composite assessment that takes into account factors such as ability to empty the bladder, frequency of urination, intermittency of urination, urgency of urination, weak strength of urine stream, straining while urinating, and having to urinate multiple times at night after going to bed. Topsalysin continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile, with no evidence of any treatment related sexual or cardiovascular side effects.
 
 We are not currently planning on initiating additional clinical trials, including a potential registration trial in localized prostate cancer or a second Phase 3 trial in BPH, unless we obtain additional funding or secure a development partner to fund such new clinical trials. There can be no assurance that such funding or a development partner will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, we cannot currently estimate when the clinical development required to seek the regulatory approvals needed to commercialize topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer or the treatment of the symptoms of BPH will be completed.

Topsalysin - Mechanism of Action 
 
Topsalysin is a genetically altered form of the naturally occurring protein proaerolysin. In nature, proaerolysin is produced by Aeromonas bacteria, which are commonly found as a contaminant in fresh water and fresh water fish. We have altered the sequence encoding the bacterial protein so that topsalysin is only activated by enzymatically active PSA (as shown in the figure below), an enzyme that is produced in large quantities in the prostate of men with prostate cancer and BPH.
 
Topsalysin binds to the GPI-anchored receptors on the cell surface of prostate cells. Once activated by PSA, topsalysin combines with other activated topsalysin molecules, forming stable transmembrane pores that induce cell death. Topsalysin has not been detected in plasma following injection into the prostate. The prostate specific activation of topsalysin by enzymatically active PSA thus limits exposure of non-prostate tissues to the drug’s activity, contributing to the safety of the therapy.
 
The mechanism of action is shown in the figure below.
 
Topsalysin Mechanism of Action 

Background on Clinically Significant Localized Prostate Cancer
 
Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, there were approximately 165,000 new cases of prostate cancer in the United States identified in 2018 with approximately 78% of patients diagnosed with localized disease (disease that has not progressed beyond the confines of the prostate). In the United States, approximately 29,000 were expected to die from prostate cancer in 2018.
 
Prostate cancer grows very slowly and research has shown that, in many cases, patients with early low risk localized disease have a low likelihood of the cancer spreading beyond the confines of the prostate. These patients may elect to undergo active surveillance, which does not offer any therapeutic benefit but means that their doctor will continue to monitor the patient (typically PSA levels, digital rectal exams and periodic or as indicated biopsies) for any progression of disease. The information collected by the doctor during active surveillance is used to determine if a patient can remain in active surveillance or should undergo treatment. The complex psychological impact that results from a cancer diagnosis is demonstrated by a significant proportion of men (about 10% in most studies) electing to undergo treatment, even though they have had no evidence of biochemical or histopathological progression of their disease during active surveillance.

Current Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer 
 
Patients with localized prostate cancer who elect to treat their prostate cancer have traditionally been offered radical treatments in the form of surgery to remove the entire prostate and/or whole gland radiation. Potential side effects and toxicities from radical treatments can be significant and permanent. Men who have undergone radical treatments have experienced the following side effects and toxicity rates: erectile dysfunction 30% - 90%, incontinence 5% - 20% and rectal toxicity (which could include proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) with bleeding and bowel problems such as diarrhea) 5% - 20%.
 
The increasing use of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, or mpMRI, of the prostate and advances in software to co-register previously obtained mpMRI images with live 3D ultrasound images enables physicians to more accurately target their prostate biopsies. Consequently, it is increasingly possible to more confidently identify men with clinically significant lesions. This enables physicians and patients to make a more informed decision about the clinical significance of their disease and whether their disease is at a stage that requires treatment. If it is agreed that treatment is appropriate some patients may be a candidate for targeted focal therapy rather than radical therapies. The objective of targeted focal therapy is to remove the significant disease while preserving as much of the prostate as possible thereby potentially avoiding many of the complications and side effects associated with the radical whole gland treatments. There are several focal targeted therapies currently being offered to patients such as targeted laser ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation and photodynamic therapy each with the aim of reducing the treatment impact to the surrounding anatomical structures, potentially leading to lower rates of side effects while retaining the cancer control benefits that the whole gland radical treatments offer. This focal targeted approach to the treatment of prostate cancer is consistent with the management of almost all other solid organ cancers (breast, kidney, liver and pancreas) in which organ preservation is fundamental to functional preservation.
 
Topsalysin for the Targeted Focal Treatment of Clinically Significant Localized Prostate Cancer
 
The intraprostatic injection of topsalysin represents a highly targeted approach for potentially treating clinically significant localized prostate cancer that is confined within the encapsulated prostate gland for two reasons:

● | a targeted focal delivery of an intraprostatic injection of topsalysin directly into and around a pre-identified tumor(s) within the prostate is now possible; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | topsalysin has a highly targeted mechanism of action, activated specifically only within the prostate. 

 
Using advancements in MRI and 3D ultrasound imaging, physicians are able to deliver the injection of topsalysin directly into the tumors located within the prostate. The increased use of mpMRI and advances in software to co-register the mpMRI images with live 3D ultrasound images also means that physicians are now able to locate tumors within the prostate and take more accurate biopsies from a patient, enabling the diagnosis of clinically significant lesions. These technical advances are enabling physicians and patients to make a more informed decision about the clinical significance of their disease and whether their disease requires radical treatment or they would be candidates for active surveillance. In addition, these advances make it possible to identify patients with clinically significant lesions that could be candidates for targeted ablation with a focal therapy. The targeted focal treatment of localized prostate cancer is consistent with the treatment approach frequently used for other solid tumors such as breast and liver cancer, where the objective is to remove the tumor and preserve as much of the organ as possible.
 
 The mechanism of action of topsalysin allows for a highly targeted therapeutic activity in localized disease. Topsalysin is only activated in the presence of enzymatically active PSA which is found surrounding prostate cancer lesions. Therefore, we believe topsalysin has the potential to provide a focal targeted therapy for the ablation of localized prostate cancer while potentially avoiding many of the complications and side effects associated with radical treatments.
 
Background on BPH 
 
BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that commonly affects men who are age 50 and older. BPH causes a restriction in urine flow from the urethra resulting in lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS. BPH, and its associated clinical manifestations of LUTS, is one of the most common medical conditions of aging men in the United States, with approximately 70% men aged 60-69 years and 80% of men older than the age of 70 being affected by BPH. The number of men with symptoms of BPH is expected to increase as the male population ages. Our market research suggests that as many as 36 million men in the United States are affected by BPH with approximately five million of these men suffering from bothersome symptoms. Symptomatic BPH greatly diminishes a patient’s quality of life. It causes a significant array of LUTS, including increased urinary frequency, urgency to urinate, frequent night-time urination, weak urine stream, and incomplete emptying of the bladder. In addition, men with BPH symptoms are predisposed to a higher risk of urinary tract infections, urinary stone formation, bladder damage, and in very late stage and/or unattended cases, renal damage.

Current Therapies for BPH 
 
Physicians and patients choose treatments for the symptoms of BPH primarily based on the severity of symptoms, the patient’s quality of life and the presence of other medical conditions. Treatment options include watchful waiting, lifestyle changes, oral medications, minimally invasive surgical therapies or more aggressive surgical therapies, such as transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, or open prostatectomy. Our market research indicates that approximately three million men in the United States are taking oral drug therapy and there were approximately 200,000 surgical procedures for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH conducted in 2011.
 
The effectiveness of treatments for the symptoms of BPH is measured by IPSS and improvement in peak urine flow rate, or Qmax. IPSS is a patient recorded, composite assessment that takes into account factors such as ability to empty the bladder, frequency of urination, intermittency of urination, urgency of urination, weak strength of urine stream, straining while urinating, and having to urinate multiple times at night after going to bed. This index is measured on a 0 to 35 scale with 0 being defined as having no problems and 35 being defined as the high end of severe symptoms. Patients are typically considered to have mild symptoms with IPSS of 1 to 7, moderate symptoms with scores of 8 to 19 and severe symptoms with scores of 20 to 35. An improvement of 3 points in IPSS is generally considered clinically meaningful by urologists. IPSS is a validated primary clinical endpoint used to assess the treatment benefit in BPH clinical trials and has served as the primary efficacy endpoint for the approval of many products for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH. An approximate 2 point difference in IPSS improvement between active and control has historically been utilized by the FDA to approve oral therapies, although the FDA has not provided guidance that a 2 point difference is required for approval of treatment for the symptoms of BPH.
 
Oral Drug Therapy 
 
The most common form of therapy for men experiencing mild to moderate LUTS associated with BPH is oral drug therapy. Current classes of oral medications available for treatment of the symptoms of BPH include alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, or 5-ARIs, a combination of an alpha-blocker and 5-ARI, and a phosphodiesterase Type 5 inhibitor, or PDE5. An alpha-blocker provides rapid relief of BPH symptoms but does not prevent continued growth of the prostate. Examples of alpha-blockers include terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin. Frequently reported side effects of alpha-blockers include hypotension, or low blood pressure, dizziness and feeling of weakness. 5-ARIs, such as finasteride and dutasteride, reduce the size of the prostate and thus provide symptom relief. It may take up to six months from starting treatment with a 5-ARI for the prostate to reduce in size and for patients to experience the benefit of treatment. Side effects include sexual dysfunction. In addition, tadalafil (marketed by Eli Lilly as Cialis®), a PDE5 inhibitor (a class of drugs typically prescribed for erectile dysfunction), was shown to improve IPSS after four weeks of dosing and has been approved for treatment of the symptoms of BPH. Headache and dyspepsia, or indigestion, are the most commonly observed side effects of Cialis®, which is not recommended for use in combination with an alpha-blocker because of the risk of hypotension.
 
Many men will discontinue oral drug therapy due to inadequate response and/or the side effects mentioned above. Another drawback of the currently available oral therapies is the necessity of taking one or more pills daily. Published patient survey data (N=2,166) suggests that as many as 57% of patients taking oral drug therapy discontinue use within the first three years.
 
In previously completed clinical trials, each of these classes of oral medications has typically produced approximately 3 to 6 point reductions in IPSS, but the actual magnitude of treatment benefit observed compared to placebo is generally two to three points.
 
 Minimally Invasive Surgical Therapies 
 
Minimally invasive surgical therapies used to treat the symptoms of BPH include transurethral microwave thermotherapy, or TUMT, transurethral needle ablation, or TUNA, Urolift®, a system which lifts and holds the enlarged prostate tissue away from the urethra, and green laser treatment, which delivers high energy to ablate the prostatic tissue as an alternative to TURP. These treatments, frequently referred to as MIST, are generally less effective than surgical procedures in reducing the size of the prostate gland and often require retreatment within three years. However, these treatments may require catheterization and are still associated with pain and the potential for complications such as bleeding and long-lasting side effects such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (semen flowing backward into the bladder). A new TUNA, known as the Rezum System, was approved in 2015. Rezum delivers radiofrequency generated thermal therapy in the form of water vapor via a transurethral needle. Studies of MIST procedures have shown varying improvements in IPSS, with TUNA and TUMT showing improvement in IPSS of approximately 10 to 13 points.
 
 5


Other Surgical Options 
 
Surgical procedures such as TURP typically reduce the size of the prostate gland and relieve the pressure on the urethra by ablating the prostate tissue that blocks the flow of urine. Studies of surgical procedures have generally shown reductions in IPSS of approximately 16 points. TURP is performed under spinal or general anesthesia, which carries the risk of side effects. TURP may result in nerve damage, bleeding (sometimes requiring transfusion), and long-lasting side effects, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation.
 
Topsalysin for the Treatment of the Symptoms of BPH 
 
In our completed Phase 3 clinical trial, topsalysin significantly improved symptoms of BPH through 12 months of follow-up after a single treatment. Topsalysin is designed to be a safe, simple and convenient treatment that provides rapid and sustained relief of BPH symptoms. It is delivered through a targeted injection into the prostate, precisely ablating the prostate tissue without damaging neighboring tissue and nerves. This method of administration limits the circulation of the drug in the body and we believe that this limited systemic exposure to the drug, together with how the drug is activated in the body, greatly diminishes the risk of side effects.
 
The injection of topsalysin is individualized to each patient based on the size of the prostate and the drug is delivered in a procedure that can be performed in a urologist’s office. The entire process can be completed during a short office visit, and the actual injection of the drug into each of the two lobes of the prostate takes approximately four minutes. A physician administering topsalysin may elect to administer a local anesthetic before injection. Most urologists are familiar with the transrectal route of administration, as it is the same method urologists use to take biopsies of the prostate.
 
Market research we conducted with 100 urologists in 2012 has shown that topsalysin compares favorably to both oral therapies and procedures on a number of key attributes related to effectiveness, safety, tolerability, and burden placed on the patient. Specifically, when shown results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, the physicians viewed topsalysin as being more effective and having a better side effect profile than currently available oral drugs. Administration of topsalysin was also perceived as more effective, safer, and easier to perform than MIST procedures, TUNA and TUMT. When compared to TURP surgery, topsalysin was also perceived as safer and easier to administer. In this market research, physicians indicated a willingness to consider topsalysin as an alternative to both oral therapies and surgical procedures and also viewed topsalysin as a potential new choice for men who have discontinued oral therapy and are not willing to undergo a surgical procedure.
 
Clinical Overview 
 
To date, we have completed nine clinical trials of topsalysin. Five of our completed clinical trials were for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH and four were for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the nine completed clinical trials a total of 365 patients with moderate to severe BPH and 86 patients with prostate cancer have been treated with topsalysin for a combined topsalysin exposure of 451 patients.
 
We have completed two clinical trials for the targeted focal treatment of localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer. A single administration of topsalysin continues to appear safe and well-tolerated by patients. Adverse events considered related to topsalysin were typically mild and typically occurred and resolved within a day of administration. In addition, urine function was preserved, there was no sexual dysfunction, no hypersensitivity reactions or other serious systemic reactions considered related to topsalysin after a single administration.
 
A single administration of topsalysin has also demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells as observed on targeted biopsy six months after the targeted treatment of a pre-identified lesion in a patient population with clinically significant localized prostate cancer.
 
In our Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of localized prostate cancer, a review of the safety data from a total of eleven patients who received a second administration indicated that a second dose appears to be both safe and well-tolerated by patients. Based on the review of the six-month biopsy results following the second administration of topsalysin, we have concluded that there appears to be no additional clinical benefit gained with a second administration as given in this Phase 2b trial.
 
In addition to the two trials in which topsalysin was administered as a targeted focal therapy in patients with low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer, the Company had previously completed two clinical trials of topsalysin in a different patient population, as a treatment for locally recurrent prostate cancer. The patients in these two small open-label studies were patients who had previously undergone radiation for the treatment of their prostate cancer and showed signs of disease recurrence evidenced by rising levels of PSA. The results from these clinical trials demonstrated that topsalysin was well-tolerated and showed early signs of therapeutic activity following a single intraprostatic treatment.
 
All of the completed clinical trials of topsalysin for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH have shown clinically meaningful, sustained efficacy with regard to improvement in LUTS, as measured by IPSS and Qmax, the standard measures of the treatment of LUTS for BPH. Topsalysin has been well-tolerated in all completed BPH clinical trials to date. Adverse events in our completed BPH clinical trials were typically mild and transient in nature, limited to local discomfort and irritative urinary symptoms that generally occurred on the same day as topsalysin injection. There have been no drug-related sexual or cardiovascular side effects reported.

Seven clinical trials for topsalysin (four prostate cancer trials and three BPH trials) used the transperineal route of administration for the intraprostatic injection and the two most recent clinical trials in BPH, including our completed PLUS-1 trial, used the transrectal route. The transrectal route appears to be as well tolerated as the transperineal route.

Clinical Development in Localized Prostate Cancer 
 
 Phase 2b Open-Label Clinical Trial in Localized Prostate Cancer
 
The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single, and if applicable, a second administration of topsalysin, when used to focally ablate a histologically-proven, clinically significant lesion in patients with low-to-intermediate localized prostate cancer.
 
In the Phase 2b clinical trial, 38 patients with pre-identified, localized prostate cancer received a single administration of topsalysin at eight clinical trial sites in the United Kingdom and United States. Six months after administration, patients received a follow-up targeted biopsy of the treated lesion. Six-month follow-up biopsies have been undertaken and evaluated from 37 of 38 patients treated with a single administration of topsalysin, with one patient having been lost to follow-up following re-location.
 
Final Safety and Biopsy Results from a Single Administration of Topsalysin:
 
To date, a single administration of topsalysin continues to appear safe and well tolerated by patients with no new safety signals. No hypersensitivity reactions or other serious systemic reactions to study medication were observed after a single administration. Analysis of the safety data from all 38 patients receiving a single administration of topsalysin indicate the following adverse events occurred in more than one patient and were considered related to topsalysin: dysuria (3 patients), urinary retention (3 patients), proctalgia (2 patients), perineal pain (2 patients), nocturia (2 patients), micturition urgency (2 patients) and strangury (2 patients). Topsalysin related adverse events were typically considered mild and typically resolved within one day. One event of micturition urgency was considered severe and resolved the same day, two events were considered moderate in severity, one event of perineal pain which resolved within a day and one event of urinary retention was considered moderate and the event was considered resolved after the patient underwent a transurethral resection of the prostate. One event of stranguary considered related to topsalysin and mild was reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) because the patient was hospitalized overnight for monitoring as was the practice at the site in the UK where the patient had been treated. The event of stranguary resolved the next day and the patient was released from the hospital.
 
A secondary objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a single administration of topsalysin to selectively target and focally ablate a pre-identified lesion.
 
A single administration of topsalysin continues to demonstrate an ability to ablate targeted prostate cancer cells. The final six-month biopsy results from 37 patients on whom biopsy data were available indicate that, 27% of patients (10/37) achieved a clinical response, defined in this trial as no detectable tumor on targeted biopsy of the treated lesion or a sufficient reduction to deem the lesion clinically-insignificant (cancer lesion of Gleason Score 6 (pattern 3+3) and a maximum cancer core length, or MCCL, of less than 6 millimeters). This compares favorably to 17% of patients (3/18) moving to clinically insignificant disease in the previously completed Phase 2a proof of concept localized prostate cancer clinical trial. Of the 10 clinical responders in the Phase 2b trial, six patients experienced a complete ablation with no histological evidence of the targeted tumor remaining.
 
Additionally, the Phase 2b single administration follow-up biopsy data showed that: 
 

● | 41% of patients (15/37) experienced a partial response, defined as a reduction in MCCL and/or Gleason pattern, but the targeted lesion was still deemed clinically-significant based on the targeted biopsy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 32% (12/37) of patients did not respond to treatment defined as no change in the targeted lesion or an increase in MCCL and/or Gleason pattern. 

 
We believe the safety and biopsy data from the first administration of topsalysin supports moving forward into potential registration trials. We have begun planning for a Phase 3 clinical trial for topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant intermediate risk localized prostate cancer and initiation of this clinical trial is subject to receiving additional financing or securing a development partner. We expect to obtain formal regulatory guidance on a design for a Phase 3 registration trial in the first half of 2019.
 
Results from the Second Administration of Topsalysin
 
Another important objective for this Phase 2b clinical trial was to evaluate for the first time, the safety of re-administering topsalysin, and to determine if additional clinical benefit could be observed as assessed by targeted biopsy six months after a second -administration of topsalysin. To be eligible to receive a second administration, patients must not have experienced any clinically-significant adverse events attributable to either topsalysin or the injection procedure. Additionally, patients must have demonstrated evidence of a response to the first treatment with topsalysin, either through a reduction in lesion size, Gleason pattern, or MCCL. No patients who had a complete ablation following the first dose received a second administration.

A review of the safety data from the eleven patients who received a second administration indicates that a second dose appears to be both safe and well-tolerated by patients. There were no adverse events considered related to topsalysin that were experienced by more than one patient following the second administration. The adverse events that were considered related to topsalysin were typically mild and resolved within two days. Importantly, no hypersensitivity reaction or other serious systemic reactions to topsalysin were observed. Urine function was preserved and there were no reports of sexual dysfunction related to topsalysin. As previously reported, one patient who received a second dose unfortunately experienced a serious adverse event of sudden cardiac death which, following a thorough review of medical records, serology results and autopsy findings, was considered unlikely related to topsalysin or the injection procedure by both the investigator and Company. There was one event of post procedure perineal pain that was reported as mild and related to topsalysin that was considered a SAE as the patient was administered morphine and admitted to the hospital overnight for observation, as is the practice at the UK site after administering morphine. The event resolved the next morning and the patient was discharged home.
 
Based on review of the six-month biopsy results following the second administration of topsalysin, we have concluded that there appears to be no additional clinical benefit gained with a second administration as given in this Phase 2b trial. We are reviewing the decision to include a second administration of topsalysin in any future clinical studies.
 
Phase 2a Proof of Concept Trial in Localized Prostate Cancer
 
In June 2016, we completed a single-center, open-label Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial of topsalysin for the treatment of localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer. We believe that the highly targeted mechanism by which topsalysin selectively destroys prostate tissue in BPH makes topsalysin a potential targeted focal treatment for localized prostate cancer. The clinical trial utilized previously obtained MRI images of each patient’s prostate mapped to real time 3D ultrasound to target the delivery of topsalysin directly into and around a pre-identified clinically significant tumor. A clinically significant tumor was defined in our study as, either a Gleason score 6 (pattern 3+3) and >3mm Maximum Cancer Core Length, or MCCL, or Gleason score 7 (pattern 3+4 or 4+3) < 10 mm MCCL, which is thought to have the potential to progress and would therefore warrant treatment. (A Gleason pattern is a grading system utilized to describe how aggressive a prostate tumor is and how likely it is to spread. Generally, there are five recognized Gleason histological patterns and a higher Gleason pattern indicates a more aggressive tumor.) Patients received a transperineal administration of topsalysin under general anesthesia at a dose higher than used in our completed Phase 3 BPH PLUS-1 trial but less than the highest dose used in our previous prostate cancer trial. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of topsalysin when used to selectively target and focally ablate a clinically significant tumor. The potential efficacy was evidenced by histological changes, indicating tumor ablation at six months following treatment. The clinical trial was conducted at a single center, the University College London, which is well known for the focal treatment of prostate cancer in the United Kingdom.
 
A total of 18 patients with localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer were enrolled in the Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial. The one-time administration of topsalysin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no new safety signals being reported. Topsalysin demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells in more than 60 percent of patients (11 of 18 patients) six months after treatment in a patient population with pre-identified, clinically significant prostate cancer. 
 
All 18 patients enrolled completed the study. Biopsy data at six months following treatment showed that: 
 

● | Two patients experienced complete ablation of their targeted tumor with no evidence of any tumor remaining at six months; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Nine patients experienced a partial response, defined as either a reduction in the maximum cancer core length or a reduction in Gleason pattern; and
● | Seven patients had no response to treatment. 

Phase 2 Open-Label Clinical Trial in Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer 
 
In September 2009, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of topsalysin in six patients with biopsy-proven, locally-recurrent prostate cancer that, following radiation therapy, showed signs of disease progression evidenced by rising levels of PSA. Therapeutic activity in the form of overall decreases in PSA levels and in the number of adenocarcinoma-positive biopsy cores following topsalysin treatment was observed in two of six patients.
Phase 1 Open-Label Clinical Trial in Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer 
 
In May 2008, we completed a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of topsalysin in 24 patients in the United States with biopsy-proven, locally-recurrent prostate cancer that, following radiation therapy, showed signs of disease progression evidenced by rising levels of PSA. Elevated and rising levels of PSA can be a sign of the presence or progression of prostate cancer. The primary clinical endpoint of this clinical trial was to examine the safety and tolerability of topsalysin with therapeutic activity as the secondary clinical endpoint. Clinical trial results demonstrated that topsalysin was well-tolerated and showed early signs of therapeutic activity following a single intraprostatic treatment.

No topsalysin treatment-related serious adverse events were reported and the treatment-related adverse effects that were reported were mild and were primarily associated with the injection procedure.
    Plans for Future Clinical Development in Localized Prostate Cancer 
 
We believe the safety and biopsy data from the first administration of topsalysin supports moving forward with a single Phase 3 registration trial design using a single administration of topsalysin. We expect to obtain formal regulatory guidance on our design for a Phase 3 registration trial in the first half of 2019.
 
We are currently not planning on pursuing a Phase 3 registration trial in localized prostate cancer, unless we secure a development partner to fund such new clinical trial or obtain other financing. There can be no assurance that such funding or a development partner will be available on acceptable terms or at all. For that reason, we cannot currently estimate when the clinical development required to seek the regulatory approvals needed to commercialize topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer will be completed.

Completed Clinical Development in BPH 
 
PLUS-1 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Transrectal Route of Injection Clinical Trial 
 
In October 2013 we initiated our first Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as the “PLUS-1” trial, of topsalysin for the treatment of the lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH. The Phase 3 “PLUS-1” trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and vehicle-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intraprostatic administration of topsalysin (0.6 µg/g prostate) for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either topsalysin or vehicle-only injection, and then monitored for one year. A total of 479 patients with moderate to severe BPH were enrolled and randomized by September 2014. The 52-week completion rate was 91.9%, with a similar number of premature withdrawals from study for the topsalysin group (8.8%) vs. the vehicle group (7.5%). On average, the injection itself was completed in less than four minutes. This Phase 3 clinical trial used the IPSS total score change from baseline over 52 weeks using the repeated measures linear mixed model as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included Qmax (maximum urine flow) change from baseline over 52 weeks.
 
Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline, including average IPSS total score (21.2 points both groups), Qmax (maximum urine flow) (9.5 mL/sec both groups), total prostate volume (49.8 mL for topsalysin vs. 48.1 mL vehicle), prior BPH treatment (55.2% topsalysin vs. 55.1% vehicle), and quality of life (4.5 points both groups, “mostly dissatisfied” to “unhappy” with current urinary condition).
 
The results of this trial were:
 

● | Topsalysin demonstrated statistical significance over vehicle – The primary efficacy endpoint of the IPSS total score change from baseline over 52 weeks was analyzed, per guidance from the FDA, using the repeated measures linear mixed model applied to the modified intent-to-treat population of every patient randomized and dosed with study drug. Topsalysin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IPSS total score from baseline over 12 months compared to the vehicle-only control group (7.60 vs. 6.58 point overall improvement; p = 0.043), the primary endpoint of the study.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvement was clinically meaningful, rapid and sustained – In a secondary efficacy analysis of IPSS total score using an ANCOVA model and last observation carried forward, or LOCF, to impute missing post-baseline data, the improvement in IPSS for topsalysin was well sustained over the 52 weeks following the single administration. The maximal effect of 8.31 points improvement in IPSS vs vehicle 6.89 points (p = 0.012) was achieved at Week 18 with 8.04 points of improvement for topsalysin still remaining at Week 52 vs 6.64 points for patients treated with vehicle only (p = 0.022) representing an end-of-study preservation of 97% of the peak benefit.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improvement in Qmax – Secondary efficacy endpoints included analysis of Qmax (maximum urine flow) change from baseline over 52 weeks by the repeated measures linear mixed model, which showed overall improvement of 1.77 mL/sec for topsalysin, representing a statistical trend that narrowly missed statistical significance (p = 0.055) compared to the vehicle group. 


● | Improvement in Quality of Life was clinically meaningful – An additional efficacy endpoint was the patient self-assessment of disease-specific Quality of Life. On the 0 to 6 point Quality of Life (QOL) from the IPSS questionnaire, the topsalysin average change from the 4.5 point baseline was a sustained 1.6 to 1.7 points improvement from Weeks 18 through 52, which was statistically significantly superior to vehicle for every post-baseline visit beginning at Week 18 (reaching p = 0.004).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Topsalysin was well-tolerated – Topsalysin treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no patient was withdrawn from the trial or had their study drug injection altered because of an adverse event, or AE. The safety profile was consistent with that reported in the TRIUMPH Phase 2 trial. Adverse events occurring in >5% of patients treated with topsalysin regardless of assessed relatedness to study treatment are set forth in the table below. These AEs are not unexpected manifestations of the intraprostatic cellular destruction and resultant inflammation integral to the topsalysin mechanism of action. The median duration for each of these adverse events was typically less than one day. In general, these adverse events were mild or moderate, transient, began within the first few days after treatment (primarily on the same day as the study drug injection) and were resolved without consequences.

----------------------------

 

The incidence of serious adverse events, or SAEs was similar in both treatment groups. There were two SAEs assessed by the investigator as at least possibly related to treatment for topsalysin and one such SAE for vehicle. The topsalysin-related SAEs were moderate events of “acute non-infectious prostatitis” and “fever following prostate procedure” not unexpected manifestations of the intraprostatic cellular destruction and resultant inflammation integral to the topsalysin mechanism of action. The vehicle-related SAE was a mild event of “urinary tract infection.” There were no treatment related sexual dysfunction or cardiovascular side effects reported in this clinical trial.
 
In order to seek regulatory approval for topsalysin for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH, we would be required to conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial and we do not expect to commence any additional Phase 3 clinical trials unless we obtain the funding or secure a development partner to fund such trial.
 
 TRIUMPH Phase 2b Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial 
 
In 2010, we completed TRIUMPH, a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of topsalysin in 92 patients with moderate to severe BPH symptoms who were randomized to topsalysin or vehicle on a 2:1 ratio. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effect on symptoms of BPH of topsalysin versus placebo. Patients randomized to placebo, which is referred to as the vehicle, were administered by injection an equivalent volume of phosphate-buffered saline that did not include active drug product. The patient population that we used to evaluate efficacy in this clinical trial, as defined by the clinical trial protocol, was the efficacy evaluable, or EE, population of patients, which was defined as those 73 patients who (1) received the full treatment, (2) completed three month assessments, and (3) had no major protocol violation, as determined by a blinded, independent review panel of urology experts. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, and safety patient populations consisted of all 92 patients who received any study drug. Our efficacy analyses in this clinical trial used the LOCF method to impute missing post-baseline data.
 
The results of this clinical trial were:
 

● | Topsalysin improved LUTS due to BPH – We achieved the primary endpoint of this clinical trial, which was a statistically significant improvement in IPSS at three months following injection for patients treated with topsalysin versus patients who received vehicle. Topsalysin treatment resulted in a 9.1 average reduction of IPSS, as compared to a 5.8 average reduction in patients who received vehicle (p=0.040).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvement was clinically meaningful, rapid and sustained – Improvement in IPSS was observed as early as 14 days following injection and was sustained through the twelfth month of observation. This improvement in IPSS was clinically meaningful, and superior to vehicle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvement in Qmax – Topsalysin treatment resulted in an approximately 3.1 mL/sec average increase in Qmax at three months, as compared to 1.3 mL/sec for vehicle (p=0.047). The improvement in Qmax for topsalysin was apparent from the first post-baseline assessment and sustained through the twelfth month of observation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Topsalysin was well-tolerated – The topsalysin injection was well-tolerated by patients in this clinical trial. The most common adverse events that were potentially attributable to topsalysin are set forth in the table below. These adverse events generally are not unexpected manifestations of the intraprostatic cellular destruction and inflammation integral to the topsalysin mechanism of action. The median duration for each of these adverse events was typically less than two days. In general, these adverse events were mild and transient, began within the first few days after treatment (primarily on the same day as the study drug injection) and were resolved without further complications.

There were no drug-related erectile dysfunction or cardiovascular side effects reported in this clinical trial. In addition, 16.1% of patients in the vehicle group dropped out of the study due to lack of efficacy and the need for alternative therapy as compared to 3.3% of patients in the active group.

In summary, these results demonstrate that topsalysin is able to maintain a treatment benefit based on both measures of efficacy, IPSS and Qmax, which is clinically meaningful and sustained for the 12 months of monitoring in this clinical trial.
 
IPSS and Qmax in the Phase 2b BPH TRIUMPH Clinical Trial 
 N=73 Efficacy-Evaluable Patients using LOCF; 52 topsalysin and 21 Vehicle
 

In our studies and other intraprostatic injection studies, vehicle response rates of 5 to 7 point improvements in IPSS have been observed. We believe that the vehicle response is due in part to the fluid injection potentially ablating prostate cells.
 
Although the clinical trial protocol did not specify an ITT population analysis, an improvement of 8.2 points in IPSS was observed in the active group of the ITT population. This was not statistically significant when compared to an improvement in the vehicle group of 7.2 points. Thirteen percent of the active group and 23% of the vehicle group were included in the ITT population but not included in the EE population because they were deemed major protocol violators based on confounding factors. Examples of confounding factors were taking prohibited medications, including other medications to treat the symptoms of BPH, or undergoing prohibited procedures during the clinical trial.
 
Transrectal Phase 1/2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial in BPH 
 
In March 2012, we completed dosing in a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial of topsalysin using the transrectal route of administration for the intraprostatic injection of topsalysin. Each of the previous clinical trials used transrectal ultrasound to guide the intraprostatic injection, but this clinical trial was the first to use the rectum as the route of administration rather than passing the needle through the perineum. The transrectal route has the advantage of being very similar to the routine prostate biopsy procedure, and therefore requires little extra training for the practicing urologist. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial was to evaluate the three-month safety and tolerability of escalating doses of topsalysin. The safety data from this new route of administration of topsalysin were needed for a comparison with the safety profile obtained from our previously-conducted Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, which utilized a transperineal route of administration.
 
 13


We enrolled 40 patients with moderate to severe BPH symptoms in this clinical trial who were randomized to topsalysin or placebo in a 4:1 ratio within each of the four escalating dose cohorts. All patients in this clinical trial received a single, transrectal, intraprostatic treatment of study drug or vehicle at 20% of the patient’s prostate volume, in four sequential cohorts according to escalating topsalysin dose: 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.20 µg/g prostate. Dose escalation decisions were guided by an independent data monitoring committee for each new cohort after all patients in the previous cohort had been followed for at least 15 days after study drug administration.
 
The results of this clinical trial showed that topsalysin was generally well-tolerated. The side effect profile in this transrectal clinical trial was consistent with the side effects reported in the previous, transperineal topsalysin clinical trials, indicating that topsalysin injection by the transrectal route was tolerated at least as well as the transperineal route. There was one serious adverse event that was deemed by the investigator to be related to injection of topsalysin in this clinical trial. This serious adverse event of urinary retention required an indwelling catheter followed by TUNA. There were no reports of sepsis in this clinical trial. With the switch to a transrectal route of administration, there is a potential risk of sepsis as currently the rate of sepsis with prostate biopsies in the United States is approximately 3-5%. However, prostate biopsies involve as many as 20 punctures and a large needle, whereas topsalysin administration requires only two punctures with a smaller needle. There were no drug-related erectile dysfunction or cardiovascular side effects reported in this clinical trial.
 
The small sample size of only eight patients on topsalysin and two patients on vehicle in each cohort was insufficient to show statistically significant improvements in BPH symptoms compared to vehicle. Although improvement in IPSS was noted on average for all dose cohorts through 12 months, there is no meaningful difference between topsalysin and vehicle-treated patients. We do not believe that any conclusions about efficacy can be drawn from this study due to the small sample size.
 
In our TRIUMPH clinical trial, we observed post-injection transient elevations of two markers: PSA, a marker of prostate tissue disruption, and serum C-reactive protein, or CRP, a non-specific marker of associated inflammation. Post-injection transient elevations in PSA and CRP were also observed in the transrectal study, suggesting that the targeted delivery of topsalysin to the prostate is successfully achieved with either the transperineal or the transrectal route of administration.
 
Phase 2a Open-Label Clinical Trial in BPH (PRX302-2-02) 
 
In 2009, we completed an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2a clinical trial in BPH to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topsalysin. We enrolled 18 patients with moderate to severe BPH symptoms who were either unresponsive to, intolerant to or unwilling to use oral medications for treatment of the symptoms of BPH. In this clinical trial, three cohorts of six patients each received a single treatment of topsalysin administered via transperineal injection. We measured therapeutic activity through changes in IPSS, Qmax, and quality of life scores compared to baseline scores at screening. In addition, we monitored changes in prostate volume. In this clinical trial, topsalysin was well-tolerated and patients attained meaningful symptomatic relief through follow up of 12 months following a single treatment. Based on the results of this clinical trial, we identified 20% of total prostate volume as our volume dose for our Phase 2b clinical trial.
 
Phase 1 Open-Label Clinical Trial in BPH (PRX302-2-01) 
 
In 2008, we completed an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 clinical trial in BPH to evaluate the dose of topsalysin needed to demonstrate therapeutic activity following a single treatment, as well as to evaluate safety and tolerability. We enrolled 15 patients with moderate to severe BPH symptoms who were either unresponsive to, intolerant to or unwilling to use oral medications for treatment of the symptoms of BPH. We administered topsalysin to five cohorts of three patients each at escalating doses of topsalysin. Topsalysin was well-tolerated.
 
Plans for Future Clinical Development in BPH
 
In order to seek regulatory approval for topsalysin for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH, we will be required to successfully conduct a second Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
We are currently not planning on pursuing a second Phase 3 trial in BPH, unless we secure a development partner to fund such new clinical trial or obtain other financing. There can be no assurance that such funding or a development partner will be available on acceptable terms or at all. For that reason, we cannot currently estimate when the clinical development required to seek the regulatory approvals needed to commercialize topsalysin for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH will be completed.
 
To date, no BPH patients have been administered more than one treatment of topsalysin. Assuming sufficient capital resources, we would plan to initiate an open label repeat dose clinical trial in which patients from our transrectal clinical trial, as well as patients from our first Phase 3 clinical trial, will be eligible to receive a repeat dose of topsalysin, at least 12 months after their first dose. We believe this repeat dose Phase 3 clinical trial is supported by results from our pre-clinical study of repeat dosing in monkeys. In this pre-clinical study, two treatments of topsalysin were given to monkeys 56 days apart. Data from this study indicated that topsalysin resulted in ablation of cells after both the first and the second dose, even in the presence of circulating antibodies, and did not result in hypersensitivity.
      14


Competition 
 
In the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer we expect that topsalysin will compete with radical treatments such as prostatectomy and radiation as well as a number of other targeted focal therapies which are gaining traction such as brachytherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation and photodynamic therapy (padeliporfin di-potassium).
 
The increasing use of mpMRI of the prostate and advances in software to co-register previously obtained mpMRI images with live 3D ultrasound images enables physicians to more accurately target their prostate biopsies. Consequently, it is increasingly possible to more confidently identify men with clinically significant lesions. Thereby, enabling physicians and patients to make a more informed decision about the clinical significance of their disease and whether their disease requires a radical treatment approach with the potential for significant morbidity or whether they may be a candidate for targeted focal therapy where the objective is to remove the significant disease while preserving the as much of the prostate as possible and potentially avoiding many of the complications and side effects associated with the radical whole gland treatments.
 
In 2017, padeliporfin was approved by the EMA for the treatment of low risk prostate cancer which is defined as prostate cancer with a Gleason score equal to or less than 6 and a maximum cancer core length of less than 5 millimeters. In January 2018, Nymox Pharmaceuticals, or Nymox, announced top-line five year clinical trial biopsy data from the intraprostatic administration of its investigational therapy NX-1207 (fexapotide triflutate) in patients with low grade localized (T1c) prostate cancer.
 
We expect that topsalysin will compete with the current treatment options for the symptoms of BPH, which include oral drug therapy and surgery. Oral drug therapies include alpha-blockers, such as tamsulosin (marketed under various trade names by numerous companies, including as Flomax® by Astellas Pharma), alfuzosin (marketed in the United States by Sanofi as Uroxatral®), doxazosin (marketed by Pfizer as Cardura® and CarduraXL®) and silodosin (marketed by Watson Pharmaceuticals as Rapaflo® in the United States), (b) 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, such as dutasteride (marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc as Avodart®) and finasteride (marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. as Proscar®), and (c) combinations of a-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors such as tamsulosin and dutasteride (marketed by GSK as Jalyn®). In addition, Eli Lilly and Company’s oral drug tadalafil (marketed as Cialis®), a PDE5 inhibitor, obtained FDA approval for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH in October 2011. Several MIST procedures are available, including transurethral microwave thermotherapy, or TUMT, TUNA, photo-selective vaporization of prostate, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate, Urolift, which is designed to open the urethra directly without the need to resect or ablate prostate tissue and interstitial laser coagulation. A new TUNA, Rezum by NxThera which delivers radiofrequency generated thermal therapy in the form of water vapor via a transurethral needle, received approval in September 2015 and became available on the US markets late 2016. Currently, the most commonly used MIST procedures are laser ablations of the prostate, TUMT, and TUNA. Surgery for BPH treatment is usually considered in patients who fail drug therapy as a result of side effects or inadequate relief of symptoms, have refractory urinary retention, or have recurrent urinary tract infections. Alternatively, surgery may be the initial treatment in patients with severe urinary symptoms. Surgical procedures for BPH include TURP, as well as other procedures such as transurethral incision of the prostate and transurethral vaporization of the prostate.
 
In addition, there are other treatments that are currently in clinical development for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH. In late 2016, Procept BioRobotics announced the completion of enrollment with 184 patients in a global Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the AquaBeam System, a waterjet ablation therapy for endoscopic resection of prostate tissue. Light Sciences Oncology Inc.’s AptocineTM is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. Nymox has announced that it plans to submit a New Drug Application for Fexapotide Triflutate for the treatment of BPH in the United States.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We do not currently have a sales, marketing or distribution organization. We intend to commercialize topsalysin by establishing, either internally or through a contract sales force, a urology sales force to sell topsalysin, if approved, in the United States, or through partnership. We plan to partner with third parties to commercialize topsalysin outside the United States.
 
Specifically, we intend to:
 

● | establish a sales force in the United States of experienced urology and other specialty-care sales representatives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | build a marketing organization;
--+--------------------------------


● | establish commercialization alliances with larger or more specialized pharmaceutical and sales organizations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | generate and use pharmacoeconomic data to support the cost savings and therapeutic benefits of topsalysin.

Manufacturing 
 
We neither currently possess nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing capabilities. All of our manufacturing is, and will be, outsourced to third parties with oversight by our internal managers. In 2012, we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, or BI, to manufacture topsalysin. The manufacture of topsalysin drug substance starts with a vial of the working cell bank of Aeromonas salmonicida bacteria which is then processed through four consecutive stages involving: batch fermentation and harvest, purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography, purification using an ionic exchange chromatography and bulk formulation of topsalysin drug substance. The entire manufacturing process takes approximately two weeks. There has been a successful scale-up up to the commercial batch size for drug substance. We recently completed the successful manufacture of a batch of drug substance which provided sufficient clinical material to complete a potential registration study for the treatment of localized prostate cancer.
 
The finalization of the commercial fill finish process, for the production of drug product is still underway but we have recently completed a project which optimized our current drug product formulation for topsalysin. We have selected Vetter Pharma International GmBH, or Vetter, to work on the completion of the specifications for the fill finish process for the production of reformulated topsalysin drug product and to supply clinical trial drug product material. We are currently in the process of negotiating a long-term contract with Vetter. Vetter has recently completed a successful engineering campaign and we expect Vetter to complete a GMP fill finish of our new drug product formulation before the end of the first half of 2019.  We expect that this fill finish campaign will provide sufficient clinical material for us to complete a potential registration study for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Although topsalysin is manufactured from readily available materials using standard pharmaceutical methods and equipment, the process of transferring the technology to manufacture our new drug product may lead to significant delays and increase our costs. We will also need to demonstrate that our new drug product formulation is comparable to our prior drug product formulation. Any delay in the technology transfer to Vetter or completion of fill finish for our future clinical trial supply would result in future delays in our ability to commence additional clinical trials.
 
Our prior drug product formulation required that we procured an ingredient from a multinational industrial biotech company which was a single source supplier. Our new drug product formulation does not use this sole sourced ingredient. 
 
Supply Agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG 
 
In June 2012, we entered into a technology transfer and supply agreement with BI, for the provision of technology transfer services and for the establishment of certain manufacturing processes for, and the manufacture of, purified topsalysin, the diluting agent for use in topsalysin drug products and placebos, and a placebo to be used in clinical trials. We will be required to make payments based upon the provision and completion of certain tasks specified in the agreement. Starting in 2013, the prices of BI’s services have been adjusted annually based on the average of the Austrian trade index and the average Standard Wages Index, both as of July of the previous year, subject to certain restrictions. BI will be required to manufacture the products in line with certain project timelines. If we postpone the performance of any services, we may be required to pay certain postponement fees. Additionally, if we cancel any services we will be required to pay the entire cost for such services and the entire cost of any materials that cannot be returned by BI to the appropriate vendor or otherwise used by BI. If we are required to have any product manufactured outside our expected manufacturing cycles due to an unforeseen loss of product, we will have to work with BI to arrange an available manufacturing slot and our receipt of drug product may be delayed. BI must provide all services under the agreement, including the manufacture, packaging, storing and delivery of topsalysin drug products, in accordance with cGMP (as defined below), as specified by the FDA. The agreement has an initial term of six years and will automatically renew for a single five-year period unless either party objects to such renewal at least two-years prior to the expiration of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement early for cause, including for any uncured material breach of the agreement, the other party’s insolvency or the assignment of the other party’s rights or obligations to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party. Additionally, we have the right to terminate the agreement immediately upon the rejection or non-approval of a regulatory filing due to medical, safety or regulatory concerns or in the event that we abandon our clinical program for topsalysin due to any clinical failure, subject in each case to payment of specified termination costs to BI.
 
Intellectual Property

We hold commercial rights to topsalysin in major markets, including, Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia (except Japan where we have licensed the rights to Kissei). We in-licensed topsalysin from UVIC and Johns Hopkins. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patents and other proprietary technology rights. We file and prosecute patent applications to protect our proprietary discoveries. In addition to patent protection, we also seek to rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our technology, discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and certain consultants and investigators that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. Further, we seek trademark protection in Canada, the United States and certain other countries where available and when we deem appropriate. We have registered the Sophiris trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services as well as our clinical-stage product candidates in Europe, Canada, Japan and the United States.

Technology Licenses 
 
Exclusive License Agreement with UVIC Industry Partnerships Inc. and The Johns Hopkins University for Prostate Cancer 
 
In September 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UVIC and Johns Hopkins, with respect to the use of topsalysin for the development of therapeutics for prostate cancer. This agreement was amended on December 8, 2004 and July 1, 2010. Such amendments did not change the material terms of the agreement. For the term of this agreement, we have an exclusive right of first option to obtain a license for future improvements to the patent rights covered by the agreement. In addition, we have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under the agreement provided that such sublicenses meet certain criteria.
 
In order to secure the license, we paid an initial license fee of CND$75,000, or $62,000, applying the conversion rate as of the date of payment, and a reimbursement fee of CND$28,000, or $24,000, applying the conversion rate as of the date of payment, to cover expenses associated with the filing and maintenance fees of patents covered by the agreement. In addition, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee and are obligated to pay a percentage of gross sales for licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees during the term of the agreement. Such percentage is in the low single-digits and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. We are also required to make payments based upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones totaling up to approximately CND$3.6 million, or $2.6 million, as converted.
 
In the event we receive consideration for granting a sublicense, we are obligated to pay UVIC and Johns Hopkins a percentage of such consideration, which percentage is in the 20-29% range, including any future consideration we may receive under our exclusive license agreement with Kissei relating to development of therapeutics for the treatment of prostate cancer however, pursuant to a separate agreement which we entered into in 2003 with Dr. J. Thomas Buckley, one of our founders, the aggregate amount of such consideration payable by us to UVIC and Johns Hopkins was reduced by 25%. Furthermore, we issued 3,420 common shares to Johns Hopkins and 1,710 common shares to UVIC in partial consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and commercialize the technology covered by the agreement, and in this regard, have agreed to put a business plan in place. Our failure to commercialize the technology covered by the agreement may result in termination of the agreement.
 
 17


The term of the agreement will, on a country-by-country basis, continue until expiration of the last to expire issued patent or, if no patent has issued in such country, then 20 years after the effective date of the agreement.
 
UVIC and Johns Hopkins have a unilateral right to terminate the agreement upon notice if we become insolvent, cease to carry out our business, subject the licensed technology to any security interest or breach any of our obligations under this agreement if such breach has remained uncured for 60 days following written notice thereof. In addition, the agreement may automatically terminate in the event we undergo bankruptcy proceedings.
 
Exclusive License Agreement with UVIC Industry Partnerships Inc. and The Johns Hopkins University for BPH 
 
In October 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UVIC and Johns Hopkins with respect to the use of topsalysin for the development of therapeutics for the symptoms of BPH and other non-cancer diseases and conditions of the prostate, as amended in July 2010. Such amendment did not change the material terms of the agreement. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties under the agreement provided that such sublicenses meet certain criteria.
 
In order to secure the license, we paid an initial license fee of CND$45,000, or $39,000, applying the conversion rate as of the date of payment. In addition, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee and are obligated to pay a percentage of gross sales for licensed products sold by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees during the term of the agreement. Such percentage is in the low single-digits. Furthermore, we are required to make payments based upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones separated among the indications of BPH and two additional therapeutic indications selected by us, totaling up to approximately CND$1.3 million, or $1.0 million, as converted. In the event we receive consideration for granting a sublicense, we are obligated to pay UVIC and Johns Hopkins a percentage of such consideration, which percentage is in the 10-19% range, depending upon the rights granted under the sublicense agreement. To the extent we receive any milestone payments relating to the development of therapeutics for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH under our exclusive license agreement with Kissei we are obligated to pay a percentage of such consideration, which percentage is in the 10-19% range, to UVIC and Johns Hopkins; however, pursuant to a separate agreement which we entered into in 2003 with Dr. J. Thomas Buckley, one of our founders, the aggregate amount of such consideration payable by us to UVIC and Johns Hopkins was reduced by 25%.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and commercialize the technology covered by the agreement, and in this regard, we have agreed to put a business plan covering the marketing and commercialization of such technology in place. Our failure to commercialize the technology covered by the agreement may result in termination of the agreement.
 
The term of the agreement will, on a country-by-country basis, continue until expiration of the last to expire issued patent or, if no patent has issued in such country, then 20 years after the effective date of the agreement. UVIC and Johns Hopkins have a unilateral right to terminate the agreement upon notice if we become insolvent, cease to carry out our business, subject the licensed technology to any third-party security interest or breach any of our obligations under this agreement if such breach has remained uncured for 60 days following written notice thereof. In addition, the agreement may automatically terminate in the event we undergo bankruptcy proceedings.
 
Strategic Relationship with Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 
 
In April 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kissei, for the development and commercialization of topsalysin (and other products covered by the licensed patents) in Japan for the treatment of the symptoms of BPH, prostate cancer, prostatitis or other diseases of the prostate. Under the terms of the license, Kissei is permitted to sublicense its rights if certain conditions are met.
 
In order to secure the license, Kissei paid us an up-front payment of $3.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded as revenue a $5.0 million non-refundable milestone payment due from Kissei upon the achievement of certain development activities. In addition, we remain eligible to receive up to approximately $67.0 million in additional payments contingent upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, some of which are in Kissei’s sole discretion to achieve, separated among the indications of BPH, prostate cancer, and prostatitis or other diseases of the prostate, as well as the achievement of overall accumulated gross sales levels for such indications. The additional $67.0 million of non-refundable milestone payments is comprised as follows: aggregate milestone payments of $12.0 million are related to the BPH indication, of which $7.0 million relates to the completion of regulatory approvals and $5.0 million relates to the achievement of certain product sale goals; a total of $21.0 million is related to the prostate cancer indication, of which $7.0 million relates to the completion of development activities, $7.0 million relates to the completion of regulatory approvals and $7.0 million relates to the achievement of certain product sale goals; and a total of $21.0 million is related to prostatitis or other diseases of the prostate, of which $7.0 million relates to the completion of development activities, $7.0 million relates to the completion of regulatory approvals and $7.0 million relates to the achievement of certain product sale goals. An additional $13.0 million of aggregate milestone payments are not indication specific, of which $5.0 million relates to the completion of regulatory approvals and $8.0 million relates to the achievement of certain product sale goals. In addition, we may receive a drug supply fee and royalty payments in the 20-29% range as a percentage of future net sales of licensed products sold under the agreement. The royalties payable by Kissei are subject to reductions or offsets in certain circumstances. Kissei’s royalty obligations continue until the later of expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering the applicable licensed product, or 10 years after first commercial sale of such licensed product in Japan. Kissei is responsible for all costs associated with the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of topsalysin in Japan.
 
 18


Kissei may unilaterally terminate the agreement, provided that if such termination occurs after commercial launch of a product under the agreement, Kissei must provide us with six months prior written notice. Absent early termination, the exclusive license agreement will remain in effect until Kissei or its sublicensees or affiliates discontinue the sale of products under the agreement.
 
Regulatory Overview 
 
Our business and operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign supranational, national, provincial and municipal laws, regulations and trade practices. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of our product candidate.
U.S. Government Regulation 
 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidate, topsalysin, is subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possible review of the BLA by an external Advisory Committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 19


Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population (but larger than in Phase 1) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population (such as several hundred to several thousand) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least two groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 studies can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA.
 
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.
 
 20


Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight months from submission for a priority BLA, and such goal is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date.
 
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. Development of a REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information before a BLA can be approved.
 
The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties, or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
 
 21


We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. We believe that if topsalysin is approved as a biological product under a BLA, it should qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator BLA holder. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
U.S. Federal and State Health Regulation Laws 
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, patient data privacy and security laws, and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization.
 
The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not satisfy the requirements of an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.
 
Federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor, including commercial payors.

 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We are also subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additional state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program and/or limit expenditure for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals, and require the reporting of information relating to drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the applicable exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives that seek to promote changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in March 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, was enacted, which included measures to significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are that it:
 

● | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | created new requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological products and medical supplies to report annually certain financial arrangements, including reporting any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals and reporting annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
● | created a new requirement to annually report drug samples that certain manufacturers and authorized distributors provide to physicians; 
● | created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 
● | created a licensure framework for follow-on biological products; 
● | increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expanded the eligibility criteria for people to participate in the Medicaid program, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and 
● | established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

 
 Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as well as other legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.  For example, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to the federal health care program anti-kickback statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 
We expect that additional federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or other adverse effects.
 
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation 
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, the European Union, or EU, has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to Directive 95/46/EC, or the Data Protection Directive. The recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures that are intended to bring non-EU companies under the data security and privacy legal framework specified in the regulation. We anticipate that over time we may expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, including potentially conducting preclinical and clinical trials. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.
 
Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 
Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 
If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product.
 
Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, successful commercialization of our product will depend in part on the availability of third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products and/or payment to the physician for administering our product.

Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had six full-time employees, two of whom have Ph.D. degrees. In addition, we had engaged nine part-time individual consultants to assist us with managing manufacturing vendors and contract research organizations, project management, legal and regulatory compliance. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Research and Development Expenses 
 
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the clinical development of topsalysin. Research and development expenses are the primary source of our expenses and totaled $10.7 million, $6.2 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
