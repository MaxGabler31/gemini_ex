Overview
 Ra Medical Systems, Inc. is a medical device company leveraging its advanced excimer laser-based platform for use in the treatment of vascular immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. We believe our products enhance patients’ quality of life by restoring blood flow in arteries.
 Consistent with our business strategy to continue focusing on the peripheral artery disease, or PAD, market, we completed the sale of our Pharos laser business, or Dermatology Business, to STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc., or Strata, on August 16, 2021. Accordingly, the financial information and results of operations of the Dermatology Business has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein.
 The Destruction of Arteriosclerotic Blockages by laser Radiation Ablation (DABRA) laser and single-use catheter, together referred to as DABRA, is used as a tool in the treatment of PAD which commonly occurs in the legs. DABRA is cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a device for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. DABRA was also granted CE mark approval in Europe in September 2016 for the endovascular treatment of infrainguinal arteries via atherectomy and for crossing total occlusions. 
 Our business strategy is focused on multiple engineering efforts to improve and expand our catheter offering and explore new markets, as well as conducting a clinical study to obtain an atherectomy “indication for use” in the United States, or U.S. Key catheter engineering efforts currently underway include projects to:
  
• | Extend our catheter’s shelf life. During 2020, we identified the factors limiting our catheter’s shelf life, including the introduction of unwanted elements in the catheter’s fluid core and the degradation of the coating on the inner diameter, and we are currently implementing multiple remediations to address these issues. Our internal real time aging test data supports shelf life for our catheter of at least six months;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase the robustness of our catheter via a braided overjacket, or a similar design, to make the catheter more kink-resistant when navigating tortuous anatomy. We completed the engineering work for this catheter and subsequently submitted to the FDA for clearance in February 2022; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop a version of the catheter that is compatible with a standard guidewire. We selected a design in December 2021 based on physician evaluation in a preclinical model. We expect to finalize the design for this catheter by mid-year 2022. Engineering validation and verification will follow design freeze, and we will subsequently submit to the FDA for clearance.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As stated, we are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication for use, which the FDA defines to include a pre-specified improvement in luminal patency. To satisfy the FDA’s data requirements to support an atherectomy indication, we are performing a pivotal study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the use of DABRA in atherectomy procedures. We received an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, approval in January 2020, and the study is currently approved for up to 10 clinical sites and 125 subjects. In January 2022, primarily due to subject fallout for follow-up visits due to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, we filed a protocol amendment with the FDA to add an additional 25 subjects to the study. The protocol amendment was approved by the FDA in February 2022, increasing the total number of approved subjects from 100 to 125. 
 We enrolled the first subject in February 2020. Throughout much of 2021 and 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our ability to activate new sites and enroll additional subjects. Many sites or potential sites have been or are currently operating at a reduced capacity, and some have been closed from time to time. In addition, potential study subjects may voluntarily opt to postpone their procedures due to COVID-19 concerns. As of March 21, 2022, we had enrolled 98 subjects and seven sites had been cleared to enroll subjects. Due to the unpredictable impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have on enrollment in this study, we currently cannot estimate when enrollment will be completed, although we aim to complete study enrollment by the middle of 2022 and to complete the six-month follow-up in early 2023.

We are continuing to supply catheters to those sites involved in our atherectomy clinical study. We paused shipments of catheters to commercial sites while we conducted further studies on the stability of their shelf life. We submitted additional test data with respect to the DABRA catheter shelf life in a traditional 510(k) in March 2021, which was cleared by the FDA in July 2021. Although eligible, we have not resumed commercial sales as we continue evaluating our commercial catheter strategy.
 Finally, we are conducting research to prove the feasibility of using our liquid-filled catheter and excimer laser technology to fracture calcium in arteries in a procedure known as lithotripsy. Preliminary research work has demonstrated that our laser system can be utilized to create shockwaves of sufficient magnitude to fracture calcium in arteries. Fracturing calcium in coronary or peripheral arteries can help make the arteries less rigid, thus making subsequent procedures easier and/or safer to perform. We are fabricating various prototype systems and intend to advance our initial benchtop results. 
 Recent Developments
 Underwritten Public Offering
 On February 4, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement, or the Underwriting Agreement, with Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., as representative of the underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement, or the Underwriters, pursuant to which we issued and sold, in a firm commitment underwritten public offering by the Company, or the Public Offering, (i) 9,535,000 units priced at a public offering price of $0.50 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share that expires on the first anniversary of the date of issuance, or Series A Warrant, and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.50 per share that expires on the seventh anniversary of the date of issuance, or Series B Warrant, and (ii) 14,467,893 pre-funded units priced at a public offering price of $0.4999 per unit, with each unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share that expires on the twentieth anniversary of the date of issuance, or Pre-Funded Warrant, and together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, collectively referred to as the Warrants.
In addition, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 45-day option, or Overallotment Option, to purchase up to (i) 3,600,000 additional shares of common stock, (ii) 3,600,000 additional Series A Warrants and/or (iii) 3,600,000 additional Series B Warrants, solely to cover overallotments. The Underwriters partially exercised the Overallotment Option on February 7, 2022 to purchase 3,600,000 Series A Warrants and 3,600,000 Series B Warrants.
 The units were not certificated and the shares of common stock, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants comprising such units were immediately separable and were issued separately in the Public Offering. The pre-funded units were not certificated and the Warrants comprising such units were immediately separable and were issued separately in the Public Offering. The securities were offered by the Company pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-262195), or Registration Statement, which was initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on January 14, 2022, amended on January 26, 2022, January 31, 2022 and February 3, 2022 and declared effective by the SEC on February 3, 2022.
 On February 8, 2022, the Public Offering closed, and we issued and sold (i) 9,535,000 shares of common stock, (ii) 27,602,893 Series A Warrants (which includes 3,600,000 Series A Warrants sold pursuant to the exercise of the Overallotment Option), (iii) 27,602,893 Series B Warrants (which includes 3,600,000 Series B Warrants sold pursuant to the Overallotment Option), and (iv) Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 14,467,893 shares of common stock, pursuant to the Registration Statement and the Underwriting Agreement. Our net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses paid and payable by the Company, were approximately $10.2 million. On February 10, 2022, we issued and sold an additional 1,245,116 shares of common stock pursuant to the partial exercise of the Overallotment Option resulting in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount, of approximately $0.5 million.

Each Series A Warrant is exercisable at a price per share of common stock of $0.50, each Series B Warrant is exercisable at a price per share of common stock of $0.50, and each Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable at a price per share of common stock of $0.0001. Each Warrant is immediately exercisable. The exercise prices of the Warrants are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of recapitalization events, stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications, reorganizations or similar events affecting our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions, a holder of Warrants will not have the right to exercise any portion of its Warrants if the holder (together with such holder’s affiliates, and any persons acting as a group together with such holder or any of such holder’s affiliates) would beneficially own a number of shares of common stock in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election by a holder prior to the issuance of any Warrants, 9.99%) of the shares of common stock then outstanding. At the holder’s option, upon notice to the Company, the holder may increase or decrease this beneficial ownership limitation not to exceed 9.99% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, with any such increase becoming effective upon 61 days’ prior notice to the Company.
 The Underwriting Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company that are customary for transactions of this type. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriter against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company and its executive officers and directors have entered into lock-up agreements providing that the Company and each of these persons may not, without the prior written approval of the Underwriter, subject to limited exceptions, offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Company’s securities for a period of 90 days following the date of the Underwriting Agreement. 
 On February 8, 2022, we entered into a warrant agency agreement with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company LLC, who will also act as the warrant agent for the Company, setting forth the terms and conditions of the Warrants sold in the Public Offering.
 We are contractually obligated to pay a former placement agent a tail fee equal to 7.5% cash compensation for the gross proceeds raised, and 7% warrant coverage of the number of shares of common stock placed, in any public or private offering consummated within twelve months of the expiration or termination of our engagement with such placement agent by any investor contacted by the placement agent during the term of our engagement. A number of the investors in the Public Offering had previously been contacted by such placement agent and, as a result, we may be obligated to pay such placement agent a cash fee in connection with the Public Offering which we estimate to be between approximately $0.7 million and $0.9 million. In addition, we may be obligated to issue between 1.4 million and 1.7 million warrants to purchase common stock valued at between $0.2 million and $0.3 million.
 Termination of ATM Agreement
 On January 18, 2022, H.C. Wainwright & Co. delivered written notice to us that it was terminating the ATM Agreement with us dated January 26, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 3,811,170 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $16.0 million through the ATM equity offering facility, or ATM Facility, under the ATM Agreement. With the provision of such notice, the ATM Facility is no longer available to us.
 Chief Executive Officer Health
 Will McGuire, our Chief Executive Officer, was recently diagnosed with a serious illness not caused by COVID-19 and has been undergoing treatment for his disease. He continues to fulfill all of his duties and responsibilities and has stated his desire to continue in such roles. Our board of directors has discussed a plan of succession and will continue to evaluate and monitor our options on an ongoing basis, should Mr. McGuire need to relinquish any of his responsibilities or duties at any time as a result of his illness or otherwise.
 Effects of COVID-19 and Market Conditions
 The global effects of COVID-19 have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Although the number of reported cases of COVID-19 has recently decreased, the ultimate effects of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial condition are unknown at this time. We expect that enrollment in our atherectomy clinical trial will continue to be affected by the uncertainty relating to COVID-19, as patients 
 6


may continue to elect to postpone voluntary treatments and physicians’ offices are either remaining closed, operating at a reduced capacity or are in the process of reopening or returning to full capacity. Our manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California is currently operational. We have experienced delays in receiving shipments of parts which has had an impact on the timing of our key engineering efforts but has not affected our ability to support our atherectomy clinical study. However, the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others.
 We, like many companies, are also experiencing increased difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel due to a tight labor market.
 Securities Class Action and Shareholder Derivative Litigation Update
 On June 7, 2019, a putative securities class action complaint captioned Derr v. Ra Medical Systems, Inc., et al., (Civil Action no. 19CV1079 LAB NLS) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against us, certain current and former officers and directors, and certain underwriters of our initial public offering, or IPO. Following the appointment of a lead plaintiff and the filing of a subsequent amended complaint, the lawsuit alleges that the defendants made material misstatements or omissions in our registration statement in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, and between September 27, 2018 and November 27, 2019, inclusive, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act. On March 11, 2020, lead plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the underwriter defendants without prejudice. On March 13, 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On March 24, 2021, the court issued an order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss claims under the Securities Act in full and certain claims under the Exchange Act and denying defendants’ motion to dismiss certain Exchange Act claims. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint on April 19, 2021, realleging the Securities Act claims and certain of the previously dismissed Exchange Act claims. On June 10, 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. On November 12, 2021, following a private settlement mediation with the lead plaintiffs, the parties executed a stipulation of settlement that resolved the claims asserted in the securities class action. The settlement provides for a payment to the plaintiff class of $10.0 million. On March 18, 2022, we paid approximately $0.6 million towards the settlement and are working with our insurers to determine if we must pay an additional amount, up to an additional $0.4 million (total of $1.0 million), to satisfy our self-insured retention/deductible. Our insurers will pay the remaining amount towards the settlement. The proposed settlement requires both preliminary and final approval by the court. On February 11, 2022, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement, scheduled a hearing on the final approval of the settlement for June 13, 2022, and denied the pending motion to dismiss without prejudice. Should the court not approve the proposed settlement or if the proposed settlement otherwise does not become final, the parties will be returned to their litigation postures prior to the execution of the stipulation of settlement. Should we ultimately be found liable, the liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations for the period or periods in which such determination is made.
 On October 1, 2019, a shareholder derivative complaint captioned Noel Borg v. Dean Irwin, et al (Civil Action no. 1:99-cm-09999) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against certain current and former officers and directors, purportedly on behalf of the Company, which is named as a nominal defendant in the action. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On October 21, 2019, pursuant to the parties’ stipulation, the court stayed the derivative lawsuit until the related class action is resolved. While we have obligations to indemnify and/or advance the defendants’ legal fees and costs in connection with this lawsuit, any monetary recovery from the defendants would be to the benefit of us.
 Settlement Agreements with the Department of Justice and Participating States
 On December 28, 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement, with the U.S. acting through the Department of Justice, or DOJ, and on behalf of the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, and other settlement agreements with certain state attorneys general to resolve investigations and a related civil action concerning our marketing of the DABRA laser system and DABRA-related remuneration to certain physicians. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the agreement with the participating states, (a) if our revenue exceeds $10 million in fiscal years 2021-2024, we are required to pay an additional amount in settlement for the corresponding year: $500,000 for 2021, $750,000 for 2022, $1 million for 2023, and $1.25 million for 2024; (b) if 
 7


we are acquired or are otherwise involved in a change in control transaction before the end of 2024, we are required to pay an additional settlement amount of $5 million, plus 4% of the value attributed to us in the transaction, so long as the attributed value is in excess of $100 million, with the total change in control payment never to exceed $28 million; and (c) if our obligations under the Settlement Agreement are avoided by bankruptcy, the U.S. may rescind the releases and bring an action against us in which we agree is not subject to an automatic stay, is not subject to any statute of limitations, estoppel or laches defense, and is a valid claim in the amount of $56 million, minus any prior change in control payments.
 Our Product
 DABRA is used by physicians as a tool in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease, a form of PAD, both above- and below-the-knee. DABRA breaks down plaque to proteins, lipids and other chemical compounds, thereby eliminating blockages by essentially dissolving them without generating potentially harmful particulates. The accumulation of plaque in arteries, which is a result of lower extremity vascular disease, most commonly occurs in the pelvis and legs. Plaque accumulation, known as atherosclerosis, causes the narrowing of arteries, thereby reducing the flow of oxygenated blood to tissue and organs. If vascular blockages are left untreated, they can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, amputation or death. Major risk factors for PAD include age, smoking, diabetes and obesity. Despite its prevalence, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, or CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic, or shows no symptoms, and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. PAD affects approximately 19-21 million people in the U.S. However, only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively treated.
Current treatments for vascular blockages associated with PAD are largely endovascular and include angioplasty, stenting and atherectomy. Bypass surgery, which was frequently used in the past, is costly and often results in complications, including post-surgery pain, hospital stays and recovery times. Endovascular treatments employ catheter-based products for the displacement or removal of plaque. These treatments also have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. 
 DABRA is a novel technology for use in the endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease. We believe that our liquid-filled, full aperture ratio catheter allows for a less traumatic endovascular treatment for the removal of vascular blockages and offers potential benefits over competing treatments and therapies. DABRA is predominantly used as an adjunct therapy with angioplasty balloons, drug-coated balloons, stents, and other endovascular treatments. DABRA employs photoablation to remove cross blockages by breaking the bonds of the obstructing plaque directly. DABRA is minimally invasive and is designed to not stretch the arterial walls or penetrate the layers of arterial tissue known as the subintimal space, which can lead to dissection, or a tear in the inner lining of the vessel wall, or perforation, or a hole or a break in the vessel wall, although these events may still occur with DABRA and other competing products. We believe DABRA’s mechanism of action, photoablation, may result in less mechanical and thermal trauma to the vessel compared to other devices. In May 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market the DABRA laser system and single-use DABRA catheter in the U.S. for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease. Our initial commercial strategy will focus on placing DABRA in office-based laboratories, or OBLs, and subsequently we intend to expand into the hospital catheterization market. Reimbursement claims for DABRA procedures are typically submitted by the provider to Medicare or another third-party payor using established Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. DABRA was also granted CE mark approval in Europe in September 2016 for the endovascular treatment of infrainguinal arteries via atherectomy and for crossing total occlusions. As noted above, we are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication in the U.S.
 Vascular Disease
 Vascular disease refers to diseases of the blood vessels located throughout the body. The most common cause of vascular disease is atherosclerosis which is a progressive, degenerative condition in which plaque, consisting of lipids, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood stream, accumulates on the vascular wall. Plaque occurs in several different forms and may be located throughout the arterial system. Plaque varies in composition, with portions that are hard and brittle, referred to as calcified plaque, and other portions that are fatty or fibrous. Endovascular treatments for atherosclerosis are performed in a catheterization laboratory located in an OBL or 
 8


hospital. These patients are diagnosed by their primary care physician, podiatrist, or other specialist, and then treatment is performed by an interventional cardiologist, interventional radiologist, or vascular surgeon.
 PAD is atherosclerosis of the extremities, most commonly in the legs. Smoking, genetic predisposition, diabetes, aging, and obesity may significantly increase the risk of developing PAD. Plaque build-up reduces blood-flow to the surrounding tissue, causing claudication, pain or cramping in the leg, the most common early symptom of PAD. Symptoms may progress to include numbness, tingling or weakness in the legs and, in severe cases, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes.
 As PAD progresses, additional symptoms may develop on the legs and feet, including cooling, color changes, or ulcers or wounds that do not heal. Left untreated, PAD can progress into critical limb ischemia, or CLI, the end stage of the disease where there is not enough oxygenated blood being delivered to the lower limbs to keep the tissue alive. As of July 2019, the estimated prevalence of CLI in the U.S. was approximately 2 million. If untreated, CLI may result in ulceration, infection, or gangrene in the feet and legs and eventually limb amputation or death.
 Market Overview
 PAD affects approximately 19-21 million people in the U.S. However, only 20-30% of PAD patients are actively being treated. Despite its prevalence and poor outcomes, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including CAD, in part because up to half of the PAD population is asymptomatic and many dismiss symptoms as normal signs of aging. 
 Without treatment, the disease can result in severe complications including amputation or death. The most common reason for amputation today is PAD. Despite the relative under diagnosis and treatment of PAD, the 2022 U.S. atherectomy and crossing chronic total occlusions market is projected to be approximately $900 million. Higher diagnosis and intervention rates resulting from greater physician and patient awareness of PAD, as well as higher prevalence, are helping drive the market opportunity for PAD treatments.
 We believe that the following factors are contributing to a growing diagnosed patient population:
  
• | Increased Awareness. Emphasis on PAD education from medical associations, insurance companies and online medical communities, as well as publication in medical journals is increasing public and physician awareness of PAD risk factors, symptoms and treatment options. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evolving Physician Practice Patterns. Given that many patients with CAD also have PAD, we believe that interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons are increasingly screening patients for both diseases. As a result, we believe that physicians are diagnosing more cases of PAD. In addition, we believe that heightened awareness of PAD, its symptoms and treatment options is leading to increased referrals. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conventional Means of Treatment and Their Limitations. Physicians typically treat patients with mild to moderate PAD through non-invasive management, including exercise and prescription medication, and, if symptoms worsen, may recommend interventional or surgical procedures. Some patients who initially are diagnosed with severe PAD are treated immediately through interventional or surgical procedures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Invasive Management. For many diagnosed cases of PAD in the U.S., lifestyle changes, including improved diet, regular exercise and smoking cessation, as well as drug treatment are often prescribed. Although these measures can be effective, many people do not sustain them. In addition, these measures may reduce the symptoms, but do not treat the underlying causes of the disease. Physicians may also prescribe medications that lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure. These drug therapies are generally prescribed for the life of the patient and do not treat the obstruction, making them an ineffective treatment for many patients. As a result, many of these patients will ultimately require more aggressive treatments. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Interventional Procedures. When PAD progresses beyond claudication, physicians may advise intervention, often beginning with minimally invasive procedures. Minimally invasive endovascular treatments include balloon angioplasty, stents, and plaque removal devices. These treatments have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease. Recent 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data supports that there are approximately 1 million annual endovascular procedures for the treatment of PAD in the U.S. Angioplasty and stenting are the most commonly performed minimally invasive interventional treatments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Angioplasty. In an angioplasty procedure, a long, thin tube, or catheter, with a balloon tip is inserted into the blocked or narrowed part of the artery over a previously positioned guidewire that directs the catheter to the affected area. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the plaque and stretching the arterial wall. While angioplasty catheters are relatively easy to use, they stretch the arterial wall, sometimes leading to dissections of, and damage to, the arterial walls. Angioplasty does not remove the plaque, which remains in the artery. In addition, traditional angioplasty is not well suited to treat highly calcified lesions, lesions concentrated on one side of the arterial wall, or lesions that occur at bifurcations, all common manifestations of PAD in the leg. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug Coated Balloon. Drug coated balloons, or DCBs, are often used in conjunction with atherectomy. Drug coated balloon angioplasty is similar to a regular angioplasty procedure, but in this case the balloon catheter used has an anti-restenotic drug coating on the surface of balloon. When the balloon is inflated the drug is delivered to the vessel wall which may help prevent restenosis. Unlike regular angioplasty, low pressures are generally used to inflate DCBs thereby reduced arterial wall stretch, dissections and damage to the arterial wall. However, the long-term safety and durability of DCB angioplasty remains uncertain, in particular in treating lesions below the knee. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cutting Balloon. A cutting balloon is a special balloon catheter which has small blades bonded along the length of the balloon. These devices were developed to overcome some of the limitations of regular angioplasty, namely the risk for dissection and vessel wall damage due to the dilating forces used with regular angioplasty balloons. When the balloon is inflated the dilating force is concentrated along the blades creating small, longitudinal incisions along the length of the vessel wall. Cutting balloons are commonly used as a vessel preparation tool in conjunction with a DCB or stenting, particularly in calcified lesions or for in-stent restenosis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intravascular Lithotripsy. Intravascular Lithotripsy is a calcium modification percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon, designed for the treatment of moderately to severely calcified PAD lesions. The catheter delivers sonic pressure waves to target and disrupt calcium within the vessel. Once the calcium is cracked the balloon is inflated at low pressures to achieve lumen gain. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stenting. Stenting is generally performed in tandem with angioplasty. A stent is a wire-mesh tube that acts as a scaffold inside the artery to keep it open. Stents are currently available in a wide range of varieties, including drug-coated stents. Despite their widespread use, stents may cause injury and inflammation to the arterial wall during placement and continued trauma post-procedure. Once a stent is implanted, it cannot be removed, which may limit future treatment options such as angioplasty, additional stenting, atherectomy and bypass. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plaque Removal Devices. Procedures to remove plaque are often referred to in the medical field as atherectomy procedures. There are several types of atherectomy devices, including directional, rotational and laser, each with different mechanisms of action to remove plaque. Atherectomy treatments are frequently used with a stent or balloon. Atherectomy technologies can damage the vessel walls, which may increase the risk of restenosis. For example, cutting devices, such as directional or rotational devices, introduce significant mechanical trauma. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bypass Surgery. More severe cases of PAD may be treated by surgeons with bypass surgery. The blood flow is diverted around the occluded area using a synthetic graft or harvested vessel. Bypass surgery is performed by physicians in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia and requires multi-day hospital stays for healing and rehabilitation. General anesthesia and the potential for surgical infections make this approach less suitable for patients with conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or poor kidney function. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amputation. CLI is a serious form of PAD caused by severe lack of blood flow to the legs. Physicians may recommend full or partial amputation of the leg or foot for patients with CLI. Up to 200,000 lower limb amputations occur annually in the U.S. as a result of PAD.

 The DABRA system includes a portable excimer laser combined with proprietary, single-use catheters that together represent a competitive plaque ablation solution for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of blockages in the vasculature. DABRA represents a novel approach to the treatment of a broad range of vascular blockages that is safe and effective. We believe that the principal benefits of DABRA are:

• | Safety. DABRA is designed to track the patient’s true lumen, or the center of the artery, and not to penetrate between the layers of arterial structure known as the subintimal space. No serious device-related adverse events were reported in our 2017 pivotal study. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficacy. Unlike many treatments for PAD that do not remove plaque, DABRA employs photoablation to dissolve plaque by breaking its chemical bonds, thereby reducing the plaque to proteins, lipids and other chemical compounds. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility. DABRA enables physicians to ablate plaque to treat lower extremities both above and below the knee. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become the leading medical device company marketing excimer lasers as tools for the treatment of endovascular diseases. Key components of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Increasing the shelf life and improving the consistency of the DABRA catheter. In the third quarter of 2019, we engaged in a voluntary recall of the catheters with a 12-month shelf life to replace them with catheters with a two-month shelf life. We have identified current limitations on shelf life relating to aspects of the fluid core and coating and are currently implementing multiple remediations to address these issues. Our internal accelerated and real time aging test data supports shelf life for our catheter of at least six months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product enhancements. We are working on two important design changes to the DABRA catheter. First, we are increasing the robustness of our catheter via a braided overjacket, or a similar design, to make the catheter more kink-resistant when navigating tortuous anatomy. Second, we are developing a version of the DABRA catheter that is compatible with a standard guidewire. Following these two enhancements, we intend to develop a larger diameter catheter to target atherectomy procedures in the larger vessels more commonly seen in above-the-knee procedures.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Atherectomy indication for use. We are currently pursuing an atherectomy indication for use, which the FDA defines to include a prespecified improvement in luminal patency. To satisfy the FDA’s data requirements to support an atherectomy indication, we are performing a pivotal study designed to allow the FDA to evaluate the use of DABRA in atherectomy procedures. We received an IDE approval in January 2020 and the study was approved for up to 10 clinical sites and 100 subjects. In January 2022, primarily due to subject fallout for follow-up visits due to COVID-19, we filed a protocol amendment with the FDA to add an additional 25 subjects to the study. The protocol amendment was approved by the FDA in February 2022, increasing the total number of approved subjects from 100 to 125. We enrolled the first subject in February 2020. Throughout much of 2021 and 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our ability to activate new sites and enroll additional subjects. Although the number of reported cases of COVID-19 has recently decreased, many sites or potential sites have been or are currently operating at a reduced capacity or are in the process of reopening at reduced or returning to full capacity, and some have been closed from time to time. In addition, potential study subjects may continue to voluntarily opt to postpone their procedures due to COVID-19 concerns. As of March 21, 2022, seven sites have been cleared to enroll subjects and 98 subjects have been enrolled in the trial. Due to the unpredictable impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on enrollment in this study, we currently cannot estimate when enrollment will be completed.

• | Prove utility for lithotripsy. We are conducting research to prove the feasibility of using our liquid-filled catheter technology to fracture calcium in arteries in a procedure known as lithotripsy. Our research program has demonstrated that our laser system can be utilized to create shockwaves of sufficient magnitude to fracture calcium in arteries. An initial benchtop study demonstrated the ability to fracture medial calcium in cadaveric tissue. Fracturing calcium in coronary or peripheral arteries can help make the arteries less rigid, thus making subsequent procedures easier and/or safer to perform. We are fabricating various prototype systems and intend to conduct further preclinical studies in the next few months to advance our initial benchtop results.

The DABRA Product
 DABRA combines a portable excimer laser console with proprietary, single-use catheters for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of vascular blockages resulting from lower extremity vascular disease in both above- and below-the-knee lesions.
 The most important aspect of DABRA for the vascular market is the catheter, which transmits energy from the laser to the vascular blockage. The laser energy travels through the catheter and ablates the blockage, reducing it to chemicals that are found naturally in the bloodstream. The catheters are specifically designed for use with our excimer laser. The DABRA catheter uses a liquid-filled plastic tubing allowing for the efficient and precise delivery of the laser energy.
 The current generation DABRA catheter is a single-use, 5 French wireless (no guidewire lumen) catheter that typically stays within the normal area in which blood is flowing or true lumen, even while crossing blockages. It is a full aperture ratio forward ablation catheter, delivering fast ablation of a wide variety of plaque, without the “dead-space” of fiber optic bundle laser catheters. It produces a high-quality lumen while minimizing trauma to the vasculature. The DABRA catheter has a 1.5 millimeter blunt-tip design and a working length of 150 cm that tracks the true lumen, navigating the vascular curves. They have been used in both above and below the knee procedures, using both antegrade and retrograde approaches, and from femoral, popliteal access and pedal access.
 The DABRA excimer laser is the power source for DABRA catheters that generates a laser light by a software controlled 308 nanometer excimer laser source that produces 308 nanometer ultraviolet-B photons that are directed to the catheter through a lens to photoablate vascular blockages, reducing calcium, thrombus, and atheroma into proteins, lipids and other chemical compounds, minimizing downstream debris.

The laser is small enough for most catheterization laboratories, weighs approximately 180 pounds, (including a gas bottle), and is easily portable around and between rooms. It is easy-to-use, features a simple and intuitive operator-interface, plugs into a standard 110-volt outlet, and does not require any pumps or fluids.

The DABRA Catheter
 The DABRA Procedure
 During the procedure, the physician inserts the proximal end of the single-use DABRA catheter into the laser console. Using the buttons next to the screen of the console, the physician enters the calibration mode and inserts the distal end of the catheter into the calibration port of the console to perform the calibration. Once calibrated, the physician sets the treatment settings on the touch screen. The physician then inserts the catheter into the vasculature and under fluoroscopy, advances the catheter to the target lesion. The physician uses the footswitch to activate the laser unit and slowly advances the catheter to ablate the target lesion.
 The DABRA procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia in a catheterization laboratory. A patient treated in an OBL is discharged the same day.
 

Clinical Studies and Patient Data
 Pre-Marketing Studies.   We applied and received FDA IDE approval for our pivotal study. It was a non-randomized, single-arm, prospective, multi-site study that enrolled 64 subjects at four sites. The objective of the study was to evaluate lesion crossing by way of plaque photoablation using DABRA in the endovascular treatment resulting from lower extremity vascular disease of patients with Rutherford categories 3, 4, 5 and 6. The primary efficacy endpoint was the successful crossing of the target lesion based on angiographic analysis at time of the procedure. The safety endpoint was device-related major adverse events at the time of the procedure. It was conducted at four centers including the California Heart and Vascular Center, an OBL in El Centro, California, Centro Medico Excel, a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, the University of California, San Diego, a major teaching hospital in San Diego, California, and Merit Health Wesley, a hospital in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. As part of the inclusion criteria for the DABRA study, the target blockage must have been refractory to guidewire crossing. The average lasing time in our study was approximately two and a half minutes and the average lesion measured over seven centimeters, which is representative of a typical patient suffering from severe lower extremity vascular disease. The analyses pre- and post-treatment were performed using standard angiographic and ultrasonic tools which are commonly used in catheterization laboratories.
 The study was closed to enrollment on May 24, 2017 when we received 510(k) clearance for DABRA. 50 subjects were included in the FDA’s data used to determine the 510(k) clearance. The final study results demonstrated 94% effectiveness with 0% reported device-related SAEs, both related to the 50 subjects included in the data submitted to the FDA and the 64 subjects enrolled in the study. Furthermore, in our study, 64 lesions crossed were above-the-knee, or approximately 85%, and 11 lesions crossed were below-the-knee, or approximately 15%. 
 Atherectomy Study.     In January 2020, we received final IDE approval to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the DABRA laser system for use as an atherectomy device for the treatment of peripheral vascular stenoses.  
 14


The multicenter, open-label trial is currently approved to enroll up to 125 subjects with symptoms of PAD (Rutherford Class 2-45). In January 2022, primarily due to subject fallout for follow-up visits due to COVID-19, we filed a protocol amendment with the FDA to add an additional 25 subjects to the study. The protocol amendment was approved by the FDA in February 2022, increasing the total number of approved subjects from 100 to 125. Outcome measures include safety, acute technical success and clinical success. The trial’s primary efficacy endpoint is the mean reduction in percent diameter stenosis in each subject’s primary lesion as measured by angiography immediately following treatment with DABRA, before any adjunctive treatment. Major adverse events at 30 days and incidence of primary target lesion revascularization at six months will be the safety and clinical success endpoints.  
 Customers
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had three and four individual customers, respectively, that represented more than 10% of our total revenues.
 Sales and Marketing
 We are continuing to supply catheters to those sites involved in our atherectomy clinical study. We paused shipments of catheters to commercial sites while we conducted further studies on the stability of their shelf life. We submitted additional test data with respect to the DABRA catheter shelf life in a traditional 510(k) in March 2021 which was cleared by the FDA in July 2021. Although eligible, we have not resumed commercial sales as we continue evaluating our commercial catheter strategy.
Manufacturing
 We manufacture our excimer lasers and catheters in our approximately 32,000 square foot facility located in Carlsbad, California. Our vertically integrated facility is ISO 13485 certified and is licensed by the state of California to manufacture our sterile single-use catheters in our controlled environments. We specify and source our supplies primarily from U.S.-based manufacturers, contracting with local suppliers to manufacture custom components. We carefully choose our suppliers to ensure that all components meet our quality standards, adhere to all applicable regulations, and meet our supply needs. We inspect, test and assemble our products under strict manufacturing processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We perform our own final quality control testing of all products before shipment. In addition to primary suppliers, secondary suppliers have been identified for contingency planning purposes for many key components. We audit our suppliers as required by our quality system and the FDA. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to produce enough lasers and catheters to meet our current expected demand for the foreseeable future.
Competition
 The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. We face potential competition from major medical device companies worldwide, many of which have longer, more established operating histories, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution, and other resources. Our overall competitive position is dependent upon a number of factors, including product performance and reliability, manufacturing cost, and customer support.
 Vascular blockages are currently treated with angioplasty balloons, stents, and atherectomy devices that include excimer laser ablation. Our major competitors for our vascular solutions include Medtronic plc, Cardiovascular Systems Inc., Boston Scientific Corp., Avinger, Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., including Volcano Corporation and Spectranetics Corporation, Becton Dickinson and Company, including products from the C.R. Bard acquisition, AngioDynamics and Abbott Laboratories. We believe that DABRA competes favorably with our competitors’ products in terms of safety, ease of use, utility and cost.
 15


Reimbursement
 Our customers do not receive reimbursement for the purchase of our products. However, procedures performed using DABRA are typically reimbursable using existing CPT codes. At this time we believe that the existing CPT codes are generally adequate to describe the procedures using our products. We believe that there is no current need to apply for separate product specific CPT codes and we recognize that the existence of codes does not guarantee coverage or reimbursement. The CPT process is dynamic and changes or interpretations of codes can occur yearly. Sales of DABRA in the U.S. depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to our customers for use of our products from third-party payors, such as private health insurers, managed care organizations and government health programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are significant to our operations, as a large percentage of DABRA procedure patients are Medicare beneficiaries, and private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their own payment policies. However, no uniform coverage or reimbursement policies for services using our products exist among third-party payors in the U.S. Changes in FDA regulatory status, clinical trials, and expanded indications can also have a bearing on coverage and reimbursement. The absence of uniform policies and limits on coverage can create barriers to sale. Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for risks related to reimbursement.  
 Market acceptance of the DABRA device is dependent on adequate payment levels from third-party payors to our customers. We receive payment from the provider, facility or other entity that purchases, leases, rents or uses the DABRA device and purchases related supplies. A physician who performs a procedure utilizing either device may be reimbursed separately from a hospital by third-party payors. Under Medicare, the physician would be reimbursed according to the physician fee schedule in effect at the time of the procedure. The physician fee schedule also applies when the procedure is performed in a free-standing OBL catheterization laboratory. When the procedure is performed in a hospital outpatient setting, the hospital would be reimbursed according to the outpatient hospital prospective payment system, based on ambulatory payment classification groups. Under Medicare, the physician fee schedule and outpatient hospital prospective payment amounts can change every year and may decline.
 Reimbursement to facilities and physicians can vary substantially depending on the third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies and other factors. For example, the type and geographical location of the facility in which the procedure was performed may impact the level of reimbursement. In addition, the specific use of the product may impact reimbursement. These codes and the corresponding payment levels differ based on the size of the affected area to be treated. As a result, there is wide variability in reimbursement, and third-party payor’s reimbursement policies are subject to change. Further, requests for reimbursement are subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors. In order to better manage the changing reimbursement environment, we have centralized our internal reimbursement resources.
 Research and Development
 The major focus of our research and development team is to leverage our existing technology platform for new applications and improvements to our existing applications, including multiple engineering efforts to improve our current catheter. Future research and development efforts will involve continued enhancements to and cost reductions for DABRA. We will also explore the development of other products that can be derived from our core technology platform and intellectual property. Our research and development team works together with our commercial team to set development priorities based on communicated customer needs. The feedback received from our customers is reviewed and evaluated for incorporation into new products.

 We own or have rights to trademarks that we use in connection with the operation of our business. We own or have rights to trademarks for Ra Medical Systems and our logo as well as other trademarks such as DABRA.
Trade Secrets
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.
Government Regulation
 United States Medical Device Regulation
 In the U.S., medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval, or PMA, applications, issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 The FDCA classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class II devices provide intermediate levels of risk. They are subject to general controls and must also comply with special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed. DABRA is a Class II device.
 Establishments that manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA and provide the FDA a list of the devices that they handle at their facilities.
 17


The FDA conducts market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include: 
  
• | cease and desist orders;
--+-------------------------


• | injunctions, or consent decrees;
--+---------------------------------


• | civil monetary penalties;
--+--------------------------


• | recall, detention or seizure of our products;

• | operating restrictions, partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of or delay in granting requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or premarket approvals that are already granted;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for devices; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 Pre-Market Authorization and Notification
 While most Class I and some Class II devices can be marketed without prior FDA authorization, most medical devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved a PMA application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a premarket notification, or 510(k) submission, generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) authorized the device to be marketed through the de novo process, generally applicable for novel Class I or II devices. Some devices that have been classified as Class III are regulated pursuant to the 510(k) requirements because the FDA has not yet called for PMAs for these devices.
 510(k) Notification
 Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and limited Class I devices typically follows a 510(k) pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications, or a product previously granted de novo authorization. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
 There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special, for certain device modifications; and abbreviated, for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review. The FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt and abbreviated 510(k)s within 90 days of receipt. Though the FDA has a user fee goal to clear a traditional 510(k) within 90 days of receipt, the clearance pathway for traditional 510(k)s can take substantially longer.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or 
 18


PMA. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained.
 We have received 510(k) premarket clearances from the FDA to market our excimer laser and catheter systems for crossing chronic total occlusions in patients with symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease and with an intended use for ablating a channel in occlusive peripheral vascular disease.
 De Novo Classification
 Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FDCA, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA. This provision allows the FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II through the de novo classification pathway. The FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of devices submitted for review under the de novo classification pathway and devices determined to be Class II through this pathway can serve as predicate devices for future 510(k) applicants. The de novo classification pathway can require clinical data and is generally more burdensome than the 510(k) pathway and less burdensome than the PMA pathway. According to the most recent FDA performance review goals, the agency will attempt to issue a decision within 150 days of receipt on 70% of de novo classification requests received during fiscal year 2022.
 Pre-Market Approval
 A product not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
 Results from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to establish the safety and effectiveness of a Class III PMA device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, and information relating to the product’s marketing history, design, labeling, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
 The PMA process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification process and de novo classification process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulations, or QSR, requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of a PMA application typically takes one to three years but may last longer. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
 Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 Clinical Trials
 A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and de novo classification and is sometimes required for a premarket notification. For significant risk devices, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved under an IDE, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to 
 19


the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
 Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Pivotal clinical trials supporting premarket applications for devices are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites and are designed to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device when considering whether a device satisfies the statutory standard for commercialization. Clinical trials, for significant and nonsignificant risk devices, must be approved by an institutional review board, or IRB – an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject.
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial it has approved to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions or sanctions.
 Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. Investigational devices may only be distributed for use in an investigation and must bear a label with the statement: “CAUTION—Investigational device. Limited by Federal law to investigational use.”
 Post-Market Requirements
 After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, the medical device reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and reports of corrections and removals regulations (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA). After a May 2018 inspection, the FDA issued to us a Form 483 that included observations for failure to properly evaluate whether certain complaints related to Pharos and DABRA that we have received rose to a level required to be reported to the FDA. In response, we informed the FDA that we modified our complaint review procedures and we completed a retrospective evaluation and have not found any complaints which require a submission to the FDA. In connection with our Audit Committee investigation, the Audit Committee also found failures to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction. In addition, the FDA conducted an unannounced facility inspection in December 2019. The FDA issued to us a Form 483 that included observations that schedules for the adjustment, cleaning, and other maintenance of equipment have not been adequately established, a device master record index was not current, and document control procedures have not been fully established. All corrective actions to address the December 2019 inspectional observations are complete, and the final Form 483 report was sent to the FDA on September 25, 2020. Failure to properly identify reportable 
 20


events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, can subject us to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties.
 Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA’s oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context.   
 Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for “off-label” uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.
 The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also oversees the advertising and promotion of our products (other than labeling) pursuant to its broad authority to police deceptive advertising for goods or services within the U.S. The FDA and FTC work together to regulate different aspects of activities by medical product manufacturers, consistent with the inter-agency Memorandum of Understanding. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. In the context of performance claims for products such as our devices and services, compliance with the FTC Act includes ensuring that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, that the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and that any user testimonials or endorsements we or our agents disseminate related to the devices or services comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements.
 Violations of the FDCA or FTCA relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, including state consumer protection laws.
 For a PMA or Class II 510(k) or de novo devices, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to QSRs and other applicable regulatory requirements after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with QSRs. If the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements and patients are being subjected to serious risks, the agency can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recalls of our medical device products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, initiate legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
 Radiation Emitting Products
 The FDA regulates radiation emitting electronic products even when they are not intended to be used for medical purposes. X-rays, microwaves, radio waves, laser, visible light, sound, ultrasound, and ultraviolet light are a few examples of the many types of radiation that may be produced by an electronic product. Diagnostic X-
 21


ray systems, laser products, laser light shows, and microwave ovens are a few examples out of the many different electronic products that emit radiation subject to FDA regulation. Many radiation emitting electronic products are also medical devices. In those cases, the products must comply with two independent sets of regulations—radiation safety regulations that apply to radiation emitting electronic products, as well as medical device regulations that apply to all medical devices.
 Under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA, the FDA has established regulations specifying electronic product performance standards covering several varieties of radiation emitting electronic products. Companies that manufacture or import electronic products subject to an FDA performance standard are required to submit various electronic product reports to the FDA to demonstrate that their products comply with the standard. Unless exempted by the radiation safety regulations, a manufacturer or importer must also submit to the FDA follow-up reports for product updates or modifications, as well as an annual report for their radiation emitting electronic products. The radiation safety regulations provide specific certification and labeling requirements for electronic products. Labeling, which includes user manuals, must contain certain information, such as warnings, declarations and clear and concise instructions for use and service. The information must also be formatted in accordance with the applicable regulations. The law and applicable federal regulations also require laser manufacturers to maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.
 Non-U.S. Regulatory
 International sales of medical devices are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the devices are commercialized. The international regulatory review process varies from country to country and authorization from one country to market a device does not guarantee that other countries will also grant marketing authorization. In China, the State Food and Drug Administration, or SFDA, is the agency primarily responsible for regulating medical devices. We have clearances from China, from both the SFDA and the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA. In Europe, the regulations of the European Union require that a medical device be granted a CE Mark indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in that market. We received a CE mark for the DABRA vascular system in the third quarter of 2016. 
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Our business operations and current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, consultants, customers and patients, expose us to broadly applicable state, federal, and foreign fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Such laws include, but are not limited to:

• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a U.S. healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the health care fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), non-physician healthcare professionals (defined to include physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In particular, activities and arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, waste and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities or other arrangements related to the development, marketing or promotion of products, including pricing and discounting of products, provision of customer incentives, provision of reimbursement support, other customer support services, provision of sales commissions or other incentives to employees and independent contractors and other interactions with healthcare practitioners, other healthcare providers and patients. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our business activities could be challenged under one or more of these laws. Relationships between medical product manufacturers and health care providers are an area of heightened scrutiny by the government. We engage in various activities, including the conduct of speaker programs to educate physicians, the provision of reimbursement advice and support to customers, and the provision of customer and patient support services, that have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action within the medical device industry.

Government expectations and industry best practices for compliance continue to evolve and past activities may not always be consistent with current industry best practices. Further, there is a lack of government guidance as to whether various industry practices comply with these laws, and government interpretations of these laws continue to evolve, all of which creates compliance uncertainties. Any non-compliance could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. 
 If a government entity opens an investigation into possible violations of any of these laws (which may include the issuance of subpoenas), we would have to expend significant resources to defend ourselves against the allegations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Allegations that we, our officers, or our employees violated any one of these laws can be made by individuals called “whistleblowers” who may be our employees, customers, competitors or other parties. Government policy is to encourage individuals to become whistleblowers and file a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful conduct. The government is required to investigate all of these complaints and decide whether to intervene. If the government intervenes and we are required to pay money back to the government as a result of a settlement or judgement, the whistleblower, as a reward, is awarded a percentage. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may proceed on his or her own and, if successful, he or she will receive a percentage of any judgment or settlement amount the company is required to pay. The government may also initiate an investigation on its own. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business. In particular, if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or if we agree to settle with the government without admitting to any wrongful conduct or if we are found to be in violation of any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, our officers and employees may be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. 
 We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and the regulations that have been issued under it, impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. The requirements and restrictions apply to “covered entities” (which include health care providers and insurers) as well as to their business associates that receive protected health information from them in order to provide services to or perform certain activities on their behalf. The statute and regulations also impose notification obligations on covered entities and their business associates in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of protected health information. We occasionally receive protected health information from our customers in the course of our business. As such, we believe that we are business associates and therefore subject to HIPAA’s requirements and restrictions with respect to handling such protected health information and have executed business associate agreements with certain customers. 
 In addition, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, certain businesses are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding the use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. Aspects of the CCPA remain uncertain, and we may be required to make modifications to our policies or practices in order to comply.
 It is possible the data protection laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country and state to state and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the U.S. or in the local country. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Further, compliance with data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. We can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy and security requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. If we fail to comply or are deemed to have failed to comply with applicable privacy protection laws and regulations such failure could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
 Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA, and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes included the creation of demonstration programs and other value-based purchasing initiatives that provide financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to reduce costs, including incentives for furnishing low-cost therapies. Under the Trump Administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of PPACA or take executive action that affects its implementation. Tax reform legislation was passed that includes provisions that impact healthcare insurance coverage and payment such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain health insurance coverage (the so-called “individual mandate”). Such actions or similar actions could have a negative effect on the utilization of our products. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court’s determination in Texas v. Azar, 
 25


4:18-cv-00167, that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court for further analysis as to whether PPACA as a whole is unconstitutional because the individual mandate is not severable from other provisions of the law. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the PPACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the PPACA. The PPACA thus remains in effect in its current form. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the PPACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unclear how healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the implementation of the PPACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the PPACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
 General legislative action may also affect our business. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions of up to 2% in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of the sequester. These or other similar reductions in government healthcare spending could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Additionally, individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.
 Human Capital
 As of March 16, 2022, we had 58 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of the Company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve the Company’s objectives.
 Segment Information
 After the sale of the Dermatology Business in August 2021, we began operating our business in one segment, which includes all activities related to the research, development and manufacture of the DABRA system. The chief operating decision-maker reviews the operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the operations as a single operating segment.
Geographic Information
 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, all of our long-lived assets were located in and our revenues came from within the U.S.
