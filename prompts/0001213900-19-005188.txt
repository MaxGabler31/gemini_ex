Item 1. Business
General:
 
We are principally engaged in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite® and Star Tron® brand names. We sell these products within the United States of America and Canada.  In addition, we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products.  We also manufacture, market and distribute chlorine dioxide-based deodorizing disinfectant, and sanitizing products under the Star brite® and Performacide® brand names, utilizing a patented delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide. Unless the context indicates otherwise, we sometimes refer to Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as “the Company,” “we” or “our.”


Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Florida.  In 1981, we purchased, from Peter G. Dornau and Arthur Spector, the co-founders of the Company, rights to the Star brite® trademark and related products for the United States and Canada.  Mr. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has retained rights to these assets with respect to all other geographic areas.  Accordingly, products we manufacture that are sold outside of the United States and Canada are purchased from us and distributed by two companies owned by Mr. Dornau.  Net sales to the two companies in 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately $2,190,000 and $2,070,000 or 5.2% and 5.5% of our net sales, respectively.  See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
 
Because our operations involve, in all material respects, substantially similar manufacturing and distribution processes, our operations constitute one reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.
 
Recent Developments:
 
We are nearing completion of a project involving the expansion of the manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities of our subsidiary, KINPAK Inc. (“Kinpak”), in Montgomery, Alabama, as well as the purchase and installation of associated machinery and equipment (the “Expansion Project”). The remaining work on the Expansion Project involves completion of a bottle filling line and the purchase and installation of additional equipment. We currently are operating in the expanded facilities. At December 31, 2018, we have spent an aggregate of approximately $6.0 million on the Expansion Project, and the total cost of the Expansion Project is estimated to be approximately $6.7 million.
 
Pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement dated July 13, 2018, we acquired assets of Snappy Marine, Inc. (“Snappy Marine”), a Florida corporation that marketed and distributed Snappy Teak-NU®, a cleaning product for teak surfaces on boats, for an aggregate purchase price of $1,358,882. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. We have added Snappy Teak-NU® to our product portfolio.


Products:
 
The products that we manufacture and market include the following:
 
Marine:  Our marine line consists of polishes, cleaners, protectants and waxes under the Star brite® brand name, enzyme fuel treatment under the Star Tron® brand name, and private label products sold by some of our customers.  The marine line also includes motor oils, boat washes, vinyl cleaners, protectants, teak cleaners, teak oils, bilge cleaners, hull cleaners, silicone sealants, polyurethane sealants, polysulfide sealants, gasket materials, lubricants, antifouling additives and anti-freeze coolants.  In addition, we manufacture a line of brushes, brush handles, tie-downs and other related marine accessories.
 
Automotive:  We manufacture a line of automotive products under the Star brite® and Star Tron® brand names  The automotive line includes fuel treatments for both gas and diesel engines, motor oils, greases and related items.  Our Star Tron® enzyme fuel treatment is designed to eliminate and prevent engine problems associated with fuel containing 10% ethanol (E-10 fuel) including, among other things, fuel degradation, debris in fuel (gum and varnish formation) and ethanol’s propensity to attract water (which can adversely affect octane). Star Tron® fuel treatment also increases fuel economy by cleaning the fuel delivery system and facilitating more complete and uniform combustion.  In addition, we produce anti-freeze and windshield washes under the Star brite® brand and under private labels for customers.  We also produce automotive polishes, cleaners and other appearance items.
 
Recreational Vehicle/Power Sports:  We market Star Tron® fuel treatment and other specialty products to the recreational vehicle market, including snow mobiles, all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles.  For power sports enthusiasts, Star Tron® provides a viable solution to a number of problems associated with E-10 fuel.  Other specialty recreational vehicle/power sports products include cleaners, polishes, detergents, fabric cleaners and protectants, silicone sealants, waterproofers, gasket materials, degreasers, vinyl cleaners and protectants, toilet treatment fluids and anti-freeze/coolant.

Outdoor Power Equipment/ Lawn & Garden: We market Star Tron® as a solution to help rectify a number of operating engine problems associated with E-10 fuel in commercial lawn equipment and other home and garden power equipment.
 
Disinfectant Group: Our disinfectant group includes chlorine dioxide based deodorizers, disinfectants and sanitizers, which we sell under the Star brite® and Performacide® brand names, and which our customers sell using private label brands. Star Brite® products include NosGUARD mildew odor control bags and boat odor sanitizers. Performacide® products include disinfectants for hard, non-porous surfaces, air care products for deodorizing and products to eliminate mold and mildew. These products are sold in both a gas and liquid form. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted labeling for Performacide® used in hard surface applications that claims, among other things, effectiveness as a virucide against a variety of viruses, including HIV-1, Influenza-A, Herpes Simplex-2, Poliovirus-1, norovirus and rotavirus; as a disinfectant against a number of different types of bacteria; and as a sanitizer against certain types of bacteria that cause food borne illnesses. We are directing distribution efforts with respect to our disinfectant group principally towards the marine, automotive, home restoration, pet care and agriculture markets, and to institutions such as schools.


Contract Filling and Blow Molded Bottles:  We blend and package a variety of chemical formulations to our customers’ specifications.  In addition, we manufacture for sale to various customers assorted styles of both PVC and HDPE blow molded bottles.
 
Manufacturing:  We produce most of our products at Kinpak’s manufacturing facilities in Montgomery, Alabama.  In addition, we contract with various third party manufacturers to manufacture some of our products, which are manufactured to our specifications using our provided formulas.  Each third party manufacturer enters into a confidentiality agreement with us.


We purchase raw materials from a variety of suppliers; all raw materials used in manufacturing are readily available from alternative sources.  We design our own packaging and supply our outside manufacturers with the appropriate design or packaging.  We believe that our internal manufacturing capacity and our arrangements with our current outside manufacturers are adequate for our present needs.
 
In the event that arrangements with any third party manufacturer are discontinued, we believe that we will be able to locate substitute manufacturing facilities without a substantial adverse effect on our manufacturing and distribution.
 
Marketing and Significant Customers: Our branded and private label products are sold through national retailers such as Wal-Mart, Tractor Supply, West Marine and Bass Pro Shops.  Additionally, we market our products via online retailers. We also sell to national and regional distributors that resell our products to specialized retail outlets.  In the case of Performacide® disinfectant/sanitizing products, we sell to distributors that resell our products, in some cases under private labels, to end users principally in the marine, automotive, home restoration, law enforcement and agriculture markets.
 
Net sales to each of two customers exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales, and in the aggregate constituted approximately 33.1% and 34.4% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Net sales to our five largest unaffiliated customers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately 52.7% and 52.1% of our consolidated net sales, respectively, and at December 31, 2018 and 2017, outstanding accounts receivable balances from our five largest unaffiliated customers aggregated approximately 60.5% and 50.9% of our consolidated accounts receivable, respectively.
 
We market our products through both internal salesmen and external sales representatives who work on an independent contractor commission basis.  Our personnel also participate in sales presentations and trade shows.  In addition, we market our brands and products through advertising campaigns in national magazines, on television, on the internet, in newspapers and through product catalogs.  Our products are distributed primarily from Kinpak’s manufacturing and distribution facility in Montgomery, Alabama.  Since 2008, we have participated in a vendor managed inventory program with one major customer. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.
 
Backlog, seasonality, and selling terms: We had no significant backlog of orders at December 31, 2018.  We generally do not give customers the right to return products.  The majority of our products is non-seasonal and is sold throughout the year.  Normal trade terms offered to customers range from 30 to 180 days.  However, at times we offer extended payment terms or discount arrangements as purchasing incentives to customers.  Historically, these initiatives have not materially affected our overall profit margins.
 
Competition:
 
Competition with respect to our principal product lines is described below.  The principal elements of competition affecting all of our product lines are brand recognition, price, service and the ability to deliver products on a timely basis.
 
Marine:  We have several national and regional competitors in the marine marketplace.  We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share.  We believe that we can increase or maintain our market share through expenditures directed to our present advertising and distribution channels.
 
Automotive:  There are a large number of companies, both national and regional, that compete with us.  Many are more established and have greater financial resources than we do.  While our market share is small, the total market size is substantial.  We seek to maintain and possibly increase our market share through our present advertising and distribution channels.


Recreational Vehicle/Power Sports:  We compete with national and regional competitors.  We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share.  We believe that we can increase or maintain our market share by utilizing advertising and distribution channels similar to those we use in the marine market.

Outdoor Power Equipment/Lawn & Garden:  We compete with several established national and regional competitors.  We do not believe that any competitor or small group of competitors hold a dominant market share.  We have attempted to make inroads in this market by emphasizing Star Tron®’s unique formulation and by increasing our advertising and attendance at trade shows.
 
Disinfectant Group: There are a large number of companies that compete with us, many of which are much larger, and have much greater financial resources than we do. We emphasize the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide, coupled with the convenience in application of our products.


Trademarks:  We have obtained registered trademarks for Star brite®, Star Tron®, Performacide® and other trade names used on our products.  We view our trademarks as significant assets because they provide product recognition.  We believe that our trademarks provide protection in the geographic markets we serve, but we cannot assure that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. 
 
Patents:  We own several patents, the most significant of which relate to a delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide (the “ClO2 Patents”).  The ClO2 patents expire in 2022.  We have encountered difficulty in protecting the ClO2 patents through litigation.  See “Risk Factors - If we do not utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be materially adversely affected,” in Item 1A of this report for additional information. A 2014 adverse judgment in patent litigation that was upheld on appeal in 2015 has limited the scope of protection provided by the patent. To date, we do not believe the judgment has materially impaired our ability to effectively market and distribute our Performacide® products.  However, we are unable to predict the long-term competitive effect of the judgment on these products. 
 
New Product Development:  We continue to develop specialized products for the marine, automotive, recreational vehicle/power sports and outdoor power equipment/lawn and garden markets.  Expenditures for new product development have not been significant and are charged to operations in the year incurred.
 
Personnel:  At December 31, 2018, we had 151 full-time employees and one part-time employee.  The following table provides information regarding personnel working for the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2018:
