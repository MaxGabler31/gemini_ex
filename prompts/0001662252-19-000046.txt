Forward-Looking Statements
 
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. 
 
Company Overview
 
We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada on April 9, 2014. On May 20, 2014, our consulting geologist introduced us to a mineral property known as the “Donald Mineral Claim” and we acquired an option on that property. In May 2015, the underlying claims lapsed and we recorded an impairment of $1,150 during the year ended April 30, 2015, resulting in the property being recorded at $nil at April 30, 2019 and 2018. Management is currently searching for other opportunities in mineral exploration.
Employees
 
We have no employees as of the date of this prospectus other than our president and CEO, Yang Liu. We conduct our business largely through agreements with consultants and other independent third party vendors.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
 
Subsidiaries
 
On May 8, 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, NRC Exploration LLC in the State of Nevada for the purpose of conducting mineral exploration. On May 4, 2018 NRC Exploration LLC was dissolved.
Patents and Trademarks
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
