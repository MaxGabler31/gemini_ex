 Item 1. Business.
 Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. is a Nevada corporation formed on June 15, 1992 under the name X-Cal (USA), Inc. Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. common stock trades on the NYSE American LLC under the symbol “PZG.” Unless the context otherwise requires, reference to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Paramount,” the “Company” and other similar references refer to Paramount Gold Nevada Corp.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS
 On April 17, 2015, we entered into the previously disclosed separation and distribution agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) with Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. (“PGSC”), to effect the separation (the “separation”) of the Company from PGSC, and to provide for the allocation between the Company and PGSC of the Company’s and PGSC’s assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation.
 We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with the distribution (the “distribution”) by PGSC to its stockholders of all the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 9, 2015. On April 6, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-A with the SEC to register its shares of common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The distribution, which effected a spin-off of the Company from PGSC, was made on April 17, 2015, to PGSC stockholders of record on April 14, 2015. On the distribution date, stockholders of PGSC received one share of Company common stock for every 20 shares of PGSC common stock held. Up to and including the distribution date, PGSC common stock traded on the “regular-way” market; that is, with an entitlement to shares of Company common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. As a result of the distribution, the Company is now a publicly traded company independent from PGSC. On April 20, 2015, the Company’s shares of common stock commenced trading on the NYSE American LLC (formerly NYSE MKT) under the symbol “PZG”. An aggregate of 8,101,371 shares of Company common stock were distributed in the distribution. In connection with our separation from PGSC and PGSC’s merger with and into Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur”), PGSC contributed approximately $8.45 million to us as an equity contribution, and we issued 417,420 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to Coeur in exchange for a cash payment by Coeur in the amount of $1.47 million.
 On March 14, 2016, Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. and Calico Resources Corp. (“Calico”) entered into an Arrangement Agreement providing for the acquisition of Calico by Paramount. On July 7, 2016, after having received the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia to the transaction, Paramount and Calico completed the transaction contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement, pursuant to which Calico became a wholly owned subsidiary of Paramount.
On November 14, 2016, Calico Resources Corp. was merged into Calico Resources USA Corp. As a result, Calico Resources USA Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Paramount.
 OVERVIEW OF PARAMOUNT GOLD NEVADA CORP.
 We are engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing precious metal projects in the United States of America. Paramount owns both exploration and development stage projects in the states of Nevada and Oregon. We enhance the value of our projects by implementing exploration and engineering programs that are likely to expand and upgrade known mineral resources to mineral reserves. To further advance our projects towards the production decision, we manage the completion of the appropriate technical studies including feasibility studies and undertake permitting processes with the relevant local, state and federal regulators. Paramount believes there are several ways to realize the value of its projects: selling its projects to producers; joint venturing its projects with other companies; or building and operating small mines on its own.
The Company’s material Nevada property, the Sleeper Gold Project ("Sleeper"), is located in Humboldt County, Nevada.
 Our material Oregon property, known as the Grassy Mountain Project (“Grassy Mountain”), is located in Malheur County, Oregon, and was acquired by way of statutory plan of arrangement in the Province of British Columbia, Canada with Calico in July 2016.
INTER-CORPORATE RELATIONSHIPS
 We currently have three active wholly owned direct subsidiaries:
 New Sleeper Gold LLC and Sleeper Mining Company, LLC, which operate our mining interests in Nevada.
 Calico Resources USA Corp., which holds our interest in the Grassy Mountain Project in Oregon.

The Company’s corporate structure is as follows:
 
COMPETITION
 The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the United States together with the equipment, labor and materials required to explore on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration properties is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available through a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their exploration and development projects instead of the Company’s. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration properties.
 We do not compete with anyone with respect to our existing mineral claims because they are 100% controlled or owned by us. We believe we have or can acquire on reasonable terms to the equipment, technical expertise and materials necessary to explore and develop our current properties.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 General
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the exploring, development, production, mine closure and reclamation, labor standards, taxes, protection of wildlife and other matters. The costs to comply with government regulations are substantial and possible future regulation could cause additional expenditures, restrictions and delays in the exploration and development of our properties. We cannot predict to extent future regulations might have an impact. Future changes to U.S. federal, state or local laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect upon us and our results of operations. For additional information regarding key regulatory risks, please the section titled "Risk Factors" included in Item 1A.
Mining Claim Maintenance

Activities on our properties are conducted both upon federally owned land and private land. Most federally owned land is administered by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). On existing claims owned by the federal government, we are required to pay annual claim maintenance fees of $165 per claim on or before September 1st at the State Office of the BLM. In addition, we are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee. The county fees in Nevada and Oregon are $12.00 and $5.00 per claim, respectively. On certain claims, we are required to pay a fee of $165.00 for each 20 acres of an association placer. For any new claims we acquire by staking, we must file a certificate of location with the State Office of the BLM within 90 days of making the claim along with a fee equal to the amount of the annual claim maintenance fee.

Permitting
 The Grassy Mountain, Sleeper and other properties are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state permitting laws and regulations for the exploration, development and reclamation activities we undertake. For exploration activities on U.S. federally owned land, we are required to submit a Plan of Operation ("PoO") with the BLM, obtain permits and post financial security bonds that guarantee that reclamation is performed. We have received all permits required to carry out exploration activities for our material properties.
 We are currently in the application phase of the permitting process of obtaining both state and federal permits that will allow us to build and operate a mine at Grassy Mountain. The permitting process for both federal and state levels requires us, among other things, a thorough study to determine the baseline conditions of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of mining operations.
 Reclamation of Previous Operations
 Paramount is responsible for managing the reclamation activities from the previous mine operations at the Sleeper Gold Mine as directed by the BLM and the Nevada State Department of Environmental Protection ("NDEP"). As part of the comprehensive reclamation program, we undertake activities that include on-going monitoring and reporting, stabilizing, contouring, pond conversions and re-vegetating activities. Reclamation activities are conducted in accordance in with detailed plans which must be reviewed and approved by the both the BLM and NDEP. Additional information regarding our reclamation activities at Sleeper on Page 23 .
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 As of June 30, 2022, we employed seven full-time employees and one consultant.
 As an organization, we maintain a comprehensive compensation and benefits program to attract, retain and reward the talented employees who contribute to our business. In addition to a competitive base salary, our compensation and benefits program includes equity-based compensation and cash bonuses. We align the interest of our employees, consultants and directors with those of our shareholders by granting equity compensation with vesting conditions contingent upon meeting defined performance goals. These compensation programs are continually evaluated and updated by our Compensation Committee, our Board of Directors (our "Board") and management team, as appropriate, to reflect the evolving nature of our business and to remain competitive in attracting and retaining skilled talent.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY
 At Paramount, we are committed to ensuring our business practices integrate to the fullest extent our corporate sustainability policy and environmental, social and governance priorities ("ESG"). Our sustainability framework was developed by engaging our key stakeholders with to goal of integrating sustainability into the Paramount business planning process. Paramount is committed to being the partner of choice by communities where it operates. To do this we need to build and maintain a strong reputation based on environmental stewardship and cultivating societal success. As we advance with our permitting efforts at our Grassy Mountain Project in Oregon we strive to achieve the following: i) achieve the smallest physical imprint when we close a mine and leave the land as close to the way we found it as possible, ii) work actively with the local communities in which we operate to participate in
long-term economic development, and iii) implementing strong governance practices that promote environmental stewardship, societal success and strengthen equity performance.
