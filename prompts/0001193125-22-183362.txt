ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------


References to “Roivant,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in the following section refer to Roivant Sciences Ltd. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 Overview 
 We are building the next-generation “big pharma” company, organized to harness modern technologies and computational tools as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of nimble biotechnology companies at scale. Our mission is to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients by treating every inefficiency as an opportunity. 
 We are a diverse team of experienced drug developers, scientists, physicians, company builders, data scientists and engineers, biopharma investors, physicists and business development professionals dedicated to improving the lives of patients. At Roivant, we combine our team’s extensive experience and multi-disciplinary expertise with innovative technologies to identify and advance potentially transformative medicines. 
 We deploy a hypothesis-driven approach to identify novel or clinically-validated targets and biological pathways in areas of high unmet medical need. We then seek to acquire, in-license or discover promising drug candidates against those targets or pathways. Our small molecule discovery engine is powered by leading computational physics and machine learning (“ML”) capabilities for in silico drug design. 
 We develop drugs and drug candidates in subsidiary companies we call “Vants” with a distinct approach to sourcing talent, aligning incentives and deploying technology. Each of our Vant teams is built with deep relevant expertise to promote successful execution of our development strategy. Our Vants continue to benefit from the support of the Roivant platform and technologies that are built to address inefficiencies in the drug discovery, development and commercialization process. 
 Our agile Vant model has allowed us to rapidly add capabilities in diverse therapeutic areas, including immunology, dermatology and oncology, and modalities, including biologics, topicals and bifunctional small molecules. We have launched and taken public multiple Vants, resulting in an aggregate ownership stake of approximately $589 million in our publicly-traded Vants as of March 31, 2022 (inclusive of the value of certain shares of Myovant Sciences Ltd. as to which Roivant has a return right under certain circumstances). The Vant model also enables a modular approach to the monetization of therapies we advance through development, allowing us to pursue commercialization of some products independently, while selectively establishing partnerships for other Vants or divesting of the Vants entirely. 
 Since our founding in 2014, we have: 
 

• | commercially launched VTAMA® (tapinarof) cream 1% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducted nine international Phase 3 trials, the last eight of which have been successful;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consummated a $3 billion upfront partnership with Sumitomo Pharma (“Sumitomo”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | received five FDA approvals for drugs developed by Vants launched by Roivant, including VTAMA and four drugs that received FDA approval after their transfer to Sumitomo;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | built a broad and differentiated pipeline of drugs and drug candidates ranging from early discovery to commercial stage; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | launched Roivant Discovery, our small molecule discovery engine, consisting of a collection of advanced computational physics capabilities, integrated with an in-house wet lab facility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As part of our mission to redefine “big pharma,” we aim to develop transformative medicines faster for diseases for which there are no approved therapies or the current standard of care treatment has significant limitations or drawbacks. We believe we are uniquely positioned to accomplish this by: 
 

• | Leveraging complementary approaches to identify or discover promising drug candidates: We assembled our current development-stage product candidate pipeline by leveraging our business development expertise and vast network of industry relationships to relentlessly pursue opportunities to in-license or acquire programs where we believe we can deliver successful outcomes on accelerated timelines. In addition, our small molecule discovery engine allows us to design, optimize and validate our own novel product candidates, providing us with another avenue to pursue compelling targets or pathways and further expand our pipeline.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Creating nimble, entrepreneurial Vants: Vants operate similarly to independent biotechnology companies where each management team is focused on its respective mission and is economically incentivized to maximize value through Vant-specific equity grants. Each of our Vant teams is built with deep relevant expertise to ensure successful execution of its particular development strategy. The Vant model is designed to facilitate rapid decision making and calculated risk taking, by empowering, aligning and incentivizing Vant teams around the outcomes of their specific products or product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing and deploying proprietary technologies: We believe we are able to develop transformative medicines faster by building and applying computational tools to drug discovery, development and commercialization. We occupy a unique position at the intersection of biopharma and technology, having built our capabilities in parallel, optimizing each for synergy with the other, in contrast to big pharma who have added software tools to legacy workflows or technology startups that lack experience developing drugs. Vants have access to, and are supported by, these technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allocating capital to maximize R&D efficiency: We apply an objective, rigorous decision framework across the drug development process designed to ensure resources and capital are continuously directed towards programs we believe have a higher probability of success and away from those that fail to meet our internal hurdles. We centralize capital allocation decisions at the Roivant level, while distributing operational decisions to the Vants, allowing us to strategically deploy capital in high growth areas, regardless of potentially competing operational priorities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining a diversified pipeline with various risk profiles: We have built a broad and differentiated pipeline that includes a commercial drug and several drug candidates across different therapeutic areas, phases of development, modalities and geographies. This approach limits our exposure to several concentrated scientific and biological risks and allows us to pursue multiple innovative hypotheses across our portfolio as we seek to develop therapies for patient populations with high unmet need.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designing creative “win-win” deal structures: We structure our partnerships to balance risk and the potential for future value creation. We ensure that a significant proportion of near-term expenses go toward development, allowing us to stage our investment and align incentives as well as limit losses in the event of a setback. Our scale and proven track record of developing successful product candidates assures partners that we are uniquely capable of maximizing value for patients and investors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing operating leverage through centralized support functions: Our model allows us to accelerate Vant formation and maturation by centralizing and sharing certain support functions across various Vants. Vants also benefit from access to our vast network of scientific experts, physicians and technologists to help optimize their clinical development and plans for commercialization.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Through continued investment in our model, we believe we are well-positioned to advance our current pipeline through regulatory approval and commercialization, expand our pipeline through novel drug discovery and in-licensing and acquisition transactions, and execute on our vision of transforming the delivery of healthcare to patients.

  Our Process 
 Discover 
 We focus on developing potentially transformative medicines that address areas of significant unmet medical need. We take a hypothesis-driven approach, focusing on compelling pathways, targets and drug classes that we believe lack established leaders, and we proactively pursue or discover drugs that align with our hypotheses. We focus on building diversification and varied risk profiles into our pipeline and are agnostic to therapeutic area, stage of development and drug modality. We leverage internally developed technologies as well as a multi-disciplinary team with diverse backgrounds to evaluate the universe of targets and biological pathways that we deem compelling. Once we have built conviction around a specific target or biological pathway, we look for assets to in-license or acquire, and/or design novel drugs through our small molecule discovery engine. 
 Our ability to rapidly identify and execute in-licensing opportunities is underpinned by our diverse business development team, which consists of former investment professionals and experienced R&D and data scientists. Our track record in R&D and our ability to implement creative deal structures ensures that we are a favored development partner and are able to acquire assets on attractive terms with shared risk and aligned incentives. We have been successful in-licensing drugs from global pharmaceutical companies, small biotech startups and academic centers around the world, and we are proud of our deep network of academic and industry partners. Our goal is to add multiple potentially category-creating or category-leading drugs to our pipeline each year through this in-licensing strategy, a pace which is consistent with our track record over the past several years. 
 As a complement to our in-licensing strategy, we also apply our hypothesis-driven approach to our small molecule discovery engine, ensuring we direct our efforts toward high value pathways, targets and drug classes. We have world-leading capabilities in computational physics for drug design, with an advanced computational physics platform integrated with a proprietary supercomputing cluster and a wet-lab facility equipped for generating a broad range of experimental data. We have also built a ML platform, VantAI, tailored to the in silico design and optimization of novel protein degraders in development at Proteovant. 
 Our small molecule discovery engine has broad capabilities across multiple categories of small molecules and has three initial areas of focus: 
 

• | Heterobifunctionals and molecular glues: We are building an end-to-end platform for the discovery of protein degraders, a therapeutic approach with broad potential applicability to diseases associated with protein overactivity and with no incumbent leader. Our capabilities in targeted protein degradation include a long-term partnership with a leading academic lab, the ability to optimize our degraders using both computational physics and ML and our well-established clinical development capabilities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Covalency: We have assembled a team of experts in the field of chemoproteomics to build a proprietary human Disease Reactome database enabled by translational disease models to better understand the areas and opportunities around discovering and developing covalent binders of proteins. The combination of experimental data with physics-based computational methods allows us to assess relative pocket ligandability and protein high order structure to predict optimal covalent adduct structures and optimize molecules with desired reactivity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deficiency to best-in-class: We also use our physics-based capabilities to evaluate existing small molecules—either development stage or commercially available—that have already demonstrated therapeutic potential but have well understood limitations, such as off-target effects or binding limitations, which we believe may enable us to rapidly optimize these small molecules and bring them into the clinic as potentially best-in-class candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We anticipate that our small molecule discovery engine will expand our development-stage pipeline by generating candidates to advance through the launch of potential new Vants, or to integrate with existing Vants if there is appropriate therapeutic area overlap, in either case taking advantage of Roivant’s established clinical development capabilities.

  Develop 
 We believe the Vant model accelerates successful execution due to three key factors: nimble teams, incentive alignment and robust governance. We build Vant teams with deep, relevant expertise to promote successful execution of development strategy. By keeping Vant teams focused and generally small, we strive to eliminate excessive bureaucracy, thereby facilitating rapid decision-making and ultimately accelerating outcomes. Vants are built as entrepreneurial biotech companies, where each Vant leader is compensated with significant upside potential in the form of Vant equity. By aligning employee incentives with successful Vant outcomes, we encourage Vant leaders to take calculated risks and implement strategies that we believe differentiate the speed and creativity of their development capabilities from legacy large pharmaceutical companies, where drug developers may face asymmetric downside in the event of failure and where upside equity, if granted, is diluted by many diverse projects. Vants are also supported through a robust governance structure that is centralized at Roivant. Our governance team ensures accountability for execution at Vants and allows us to capture synergies through shared technology and certain future shared commercial functions, while at the same time providing access to a broad range of Roivant resources when Vants face critical strategic questions. 
 Commercialize or monetize 
 The Vant model is designed to maximize the value of each drug that we successfully develop and generate returns for shareholders through the independent commercialization of products, partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or the selective sale of Vants. Our primary objective is to launch commercial products ourselves, but we may sell or partner Vants or specific drugs based on the facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, the strategic rationale and financial return potential. In May 2022, we launched our first commercial product, VTAMA for the treatment of psoriasis. 
 Our Technologies 
 Our platform leverages technologies that are designed to optimize each stage of the drug discovery, development and commercialization process. 
 Our in silico small molecule discovery engine at Roivant Discovery is powered by our QUAISAR (QUantum, AI and Structure-Activity Relationships) capabilities. 
 The key components of our small molecule discovery engine include: 
 

• | A quantum mechanics-based molecular dynamics software platform to predict the interactions, energies and conformational behavior of targets and generate novel drug candidates. We can simulate hundreds of molecules per day and make predictions for drug design, enabling the optimization of properties such as binding affinity, selectivity, membrane permeability and solubility. We also have a suite of molecular dynamics and simulation tools to generate additional insights regarding individual atomic contributions to binding properties and conformational dynamics.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A supercomputing cluster composed of over 800 graphics processing units. Our supercomputing cluster allows us to run molecular simulations at biologically meaningful timescales predicting not only affinity but also how biomolecules will respond at an atomic level to perturbations such as mutation, phosphorylation, protonation, or the addition or removal of a ligand and functionally important structural changes in proteins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A suite of degrader-specific ML tools. We have developed a novel protein contact-first workflow that utilizes information about known protein-protein interactions to build new degraders that can effectively stabilize target-E3 interfaces; a degron knowledge graph, which we believe to be industry-leading, to map the ubiquitin proteasome system; and a unique model, based on millions of carefully curated protein stability datapoints, to predict degradation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

  
• | A wet lab fully equipped for synthetic chemistry, crystallography, biophysics, biochemistry and biology. Our in-house laboratories are tightly integrated with our computational physics platform to directly augment simulations with biophysical data as well as validate simulation predictions. Certain experimental techniques enable more accurate and efficient simulations on targets where we lack crystal structures. Combined with homology modeling and X-ray crystallography, this allows for the simultaneous design of chemical matter against a target while refining atomistic structural models and solving high-resolution crystal structures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our QUAISAR capabilities allow us to predict how molecules will interact by using principles of quantum physics and statistical mechanics to computationally model the forces and energies of molecular systems at atomic scale. Based on internal and published benchmarks, we believe that the speed and accuracy of binding free energy calculations in QUAISAR are on par with the best commercially available tool, Schrödinger’s FEP+, and superior to open-source methods. Further, we believe our ability to augment QUAISAR simulations with experimental biophysical data generated in-house creates a sustainable advantage compared to competitors, especially for complex conformational changes in biomolecules. These QUAISAR capabilities power in silico assays that allow us to predict binding affinity between a ligand and protein, decompose energetics into atomic contributions, predict conformational dynamics of a protein as it shifts from active to inactive states, and identify potentially novel binding sites on a protein. 
 As we have developed drugs in clinical trials, we have also built technologies to improve the process of running such trials. We have aggregated many of these at our subsidiary Lokavant. Lokavant’s software integrates real-time data from ongoing clinical trials and monitors risks related to time, cost and quality. Its proprietary data model serves as a “common language” for trial operational data and ensures that all trial data sources are ingested, harmonized and aggregated into a central database, allowing the trial sponsor to access operational trial data in near-real time. This approach is a substantial departure from traditional operations which typically share different types of trial data asynchronously and on multi-week delays. Algorithms trained on a proprietary dataset of operational metadata from over 2,000 trials are designed to identify the most important risks with sufficient time to empower researchers to implement interventions to mitigate those risks and deliver trial results on budget and on time. Lokavant’s software is in use in Roivant’s late stage clinical trials, as well as trials being conducted by other sponsors and contract research organizations. 
 In designing development and commercialization strategies for our pipeline of drugs, we also identified significant shortcomings with commercially available patient data. Today, healthcare data is siloed across multiple fragmented data sources, limiting the ability to generate a comprehensive understanding of patient health. Datavant, a company which we founded and in which we maintain a non-controlling interest, is working to address this problem. In June 2021, Datavant entered into a definitive merger agreement with Ciox Health, a leader in clinical data exchange. The combined entity, named Datavant, is the nation’s largest health data ecosystem, enabling patients, providers, payers, health data analytics companies, patient-facing applications, government agencies, and life science companies to securely exchange their patient-level data. At the closing of the transaction in July 2021, Roivant received approximately $320 million in cash and a minority equity ownership interest in the combined entity. 
 We will continue to execute against our goal of building the next-generation pharmaceutical company by fully integrating modern technologies at each stage of the drug discovery, development and commercialization process. We believe that there is significant opportunity to address inefficiencies within these processes, and we expect to build technologies where we find commercially available tools nonexistent or insufficient for our needs.

Commercial Launch of VTAMA for Treatment of Adults with Plaque Psoriasis 
 The FDA approved VTAMA for the treatment of adults with mild, moderate or severe plaque psoriasis in May 2022. 
 Dermavant has built a highly specialized commercial sales organization focused on high value dermatology healthcare providers and their patients and implementing a “best-in-class” payor reimbursement and patient point of sale access strategy, which we believe ensures broad patient access at launch. As psoriasis patients are predominantly managed by dermatologists, we have deployed a team of approximately 100 specialty sales professionals focused on a core target base of top-decile dermatologists who write more than 80% of all commercial prescriptions in the psoriasis market. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team will allow us to reach the approximately 6,000 highest value dermatology healthcare providers. 
 For markets outside of the U.S., we may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for VTAMA, if approved. 
 Since acquiring VTAMA in 2018, we have expanded our intellectual property portfolio with multiple patents, which are expected to provide intellectual property protection until 2038. 
 VTAMA for the Treatment of Psoriasis and Atopic Dermatitis 
 VTAMA is a novel, once daily, cosmetically elegant, steroid-free topical cream. VTAMA directly targets the AhR, a key regulator of skin homeostasis and inflammation, to help reduce Th17 and Th2 cytokines, two pro-inflammatory pathways implicated in plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, respectively, increase antioxidant activity, and promote skin barrier restoration. VTAMA cream is designed to be easy to apply, non-greasy and odorless, which we believe makes it cosmetically elegant. To date, over 2,200 subjects have been enrolled in 18 clinical trials of VTAMA and predecessor formulations of VTAMA cream. 
 Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 
 Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis affect hundreds of millions of people globally each year, impacting their quality of life, including their physical health, psychological state, and overall well-being. While topical therapies are the foundation of treatment, many patients fail to achieve their desired outcome due to subpar efficacy, tolerability and safety concerns, application site restrictions and limits on duration of therapy. 
 Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease with skin lesions characterized by red patches and plaques with silvery scale that affects an estimated 8 million people in the United States. Its most common form, psoriasis vulgaris or plaque psoriasis, constitutes approximately 80 to 90% of all cases of psoriasis. Psoriasis severity is typically classified by body surface area (“BSA”) involvement: mild (less than 3% BSA), moderate (3% to 10% BSA) and severe (greater than 10% BSA). Based on this classification, approximately 80% of patients with psoriasis in the United States have mild to moderate disease, which is most often amenable to topical treatment.

  Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema, affecting more than 9.6 million children and about 16.5 million adults in the United States. It is a chronic condition characterized by dry, itchy skin that often turns into a red rash. Atopic dermatitis can come and go for years or throughout life and can overlap with other types of eczema. Atopic dermatitis has a complex pathophysiology involving genetic, immunologic and environmental factors, culminating in skin barrier dysfunction and immune system dysregulation. The condition occurs most frequently in children (15 to 30% worldwide). Approximately 60% of those who develop atopic dermatitis show symptoms in the first year of life and up to 90% show symptoms by five years of age. While more prevalent in infancy and adolescence, one in ten people will develop atopic dermatitis. Approximately 89% of adult patients have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, while 11% have severe atopic dermatitis. 
 TCSs are commonly used as the first-line therapy for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. They are broadly available in generic form and carry FDA class labeling that restrict their duration of use, typically to no more than four weeks, and their location of use, prohibiting use in sensitive skin areas such as the face, groin, or axillae (armpit). While many people experience improvement with TCS, the continual long-term use of TCS has the potential to cause significant side effects including skin atrophy. As a result, healthcare professionals and patients are limited to intermittent treatment cycles of TCS therapy, leading to frequent disease flares and recurrence of disease, providing an inadequate solution for chronic conditions in immuno-dermatology. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (“TCI”) are an additional non-steroidal option for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis, but their use is limited by safety concerns, including black box warnings of malignancy reported in patients treated with TCIs. Oral and biologic therapies have become increasingly available but are often limited to moderate-to-severe psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients which comprise the smallest percentage of the affected populations. While biologics have proven to be very effective, their use has also been limited by concerns with systemic side effects, high cost, and reimbursement and access restrictions. Oral therapies are functionally limited to moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients. Oral therapies also have significant side effects and have not achieved the same level of efficacy as biologics. Additionally, recent FDA action regarding Janus kinase inhibitors (“JAKs”) have resulted in restrictive labeling and black box warnings relating to safety concerns with the product class, including oral and topical forms, and including for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. 
 Given the limitations associated with TCS, other topicals, orals, and biologics therapies, patients with inflammatory skin conditions often report dissatisfaction with their current treatment options. We see an opportunity for a novel, once daily topical treatment like VTAMA to fill the need for a long-term treatment option for plaque psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Additionally, we believe that VTAMA has the potential to be used as a complementary therapy with biologics and oral therapies. 
 Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis represent the two largest markets in immuno-dermatology and are expected to reach total sales of approximately $31 billion in the U.S. and $44 billion globally by 2026. Topical treatments serve as the foundation of dermatologic treatment, representing 83% of all U.S. prescriptions written by dermatologists in 2020. Annual U.S. prescriptions for both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are outlined below: 
 

 | TCS | | Vitamin D /Combos /Retinoids | | Biologics | Otezla | Other Oral |

 VTAMA for the Treatment of Psoriasis 
 Clinical data 
 We completed two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, evaluating the use of VTAMA in treating mild, moderate and severe plaque psoriasis in adults. In both of these trials, which enrolled over 500 patients each, VTAMA met its primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints with clinically meaningful and statistically significant results as well as favorable safety and tolerability findings. At week 12, 35.4% and 40.2% of patients treated with VTAMA in PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, respectively, achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with a minimum 2-grade improvement from baseline as compared to 6.0% and 6.3% of patients treated with vehicle control cream (p<0.0001; p<0.0001). When this endpoint was evaluated over time, rapid onset of activity was observed with separation emerging by the first evaluation trial visit (week 2) and statistically significant differences between VTAMA and vehicle control cream at week 4 and continuing at all measured time points thereafter. 
 VTAMA met all secondary endpoints with statistical significance in PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, including a key secondary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with ≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75). In PSOARING 1 and 2, 36.1% and 47.6% of patients achieved PASI75 at Week 12 with VTAMA 1% cream QD vs 10.2% and 6.9% for vehicle control cream, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of patients with ≥90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI90) at Week 12, also a secondary endpoint, was statistically significantly higher in both VTAMA groups compared with vehicle control cream (p=0.0005 and p<0.0001). In PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2, 18.8% and 20.9% of patients treated with VTAMA, respectively, achieved PASI90 compared to 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively, of patients treated with vehicle control cream. The PASI assessment is a more quantitative assessment of disease activity relative to the PGA and provides additional insight into a drug’s impact on disease modification. Similar to what was observed with PGA, evaluating reduction in the burden of disease via a PASI assessment confirms rapid onset of action with separation of VTAMA from vehicle control cream control at week 2, and statistically significant differences were noted as early as week 4 and each evaluation thereafter. 
 Additionally, VTAMA was observed to be well-tolerated, consistent with previous trials, and had low discontinuation rates due to adverse events (“AEs”), no treatment related serious adverse events (“SAEs”), and minimal severe application site reactions. 
 
13 

  AEs were generally mild to moderate in nature with the majority consisting of localized skin reactions. Overall trial discontinuations due to adverse events were 5.6% in PSOARING 1 and 5.8% in PSOARING 2. Trial discontinuation rates due to folliculitis were 1.8% in PSOARING 1 and 0.9% in PSOARING 2. No VTAMA-related serious adverse events were observed, and over 90% of eligible patients enrolled in the open-label, long-term extension study. To date, over 2,200 subjects have been enrolled in 18 clinical trials of VTAMA and predecessor formulations of VTAMA cream.

The images below show rapid and complete clearance of plaque psoriasis in a patient achieving the defined trial endpoint. At baseline, this patient’s PGA score was 3, indicative of moderate disease, and the PASI score was 17.6. The baseline image demonstrates classic plaque psoriasis with well-demarcated erythematous scaling plaques. At week 4, the PGA had decreased from 3 to 2 and the PASI from 17.6 to 4, the latter having passed the threshold 75% reduction in PASI (PASI75). The target plaques on the forearm completely resolved. At week 12, both the PGA and PASI scores were 0, indicating complete clearance of disease. PGA and PASI are global efficacy assessments. 
 

In September 2021, we reported the final results from our long-term open-label study, PSOARING 3, which showed that 58.2% of subjects who entered the PSOARING 3 study with a PGA score of ≥ 2 achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 at least once during the study. Although PSOARING 3 was not a vehicle-controlled study like the PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 studies, we believe these data provide supportive evidence regarding 
 
16 

  VTAMA’s potential therapeutic effect beyond the 12-week double-blind treatment periods utilized in the prior PSOARING studies. In addition, 312 out of 763 subjects (40.9%) achieved complete disease clearance (PGA score of 0) at least once during the study. We observed no evidence of tachyphylaxis, or a diminishing response to treatment, throughout the study, which we believe suggests treatment durability over time. 
 Relatedly, in our clinical trials, including data from our PSOARING 3 long-term open-label study, we have also observed that some patients treated with VTAMA maintained clinically meaningful disease control for an extended period of time after therapy had been discontinued. In PSOARING 3, subjects discontinued applying VTAMA when they achieved complete clearance of their disease (PGA=0). These subjects were then followed, and the time to first worsening (defined as PGA ≥ 2) was utilized to determine the maintenance of clinical benefit off therapy. We refer to maintenance of clear/almost clear (PGA 0/1) while off therapy as remittive effect. At the completion of the Week 12 visit of the PSOARING 1 and PSOARING 2 trials, subjects were offered enrollment in the PSOARING 3 long-term open-label study. Subjects with a PGA ≥ 1 began treatment with VTAMA cream applied QD until they achieved a PGA score of 0. Treatment was then discontinued and re-initiated when a patient’s psoriasis subsequently worsened (PGA ≥ 2). 
 In PSOARING 3, for subjects entering the study with a PGA score of 0 (79/763), the median time to disease worsening (defined as a PGA score of ≥ 2) following complete disease clearance and treatment discontinuation was approximately 115 days. In addition, among patients entering PSOARING 3 with or achieving a PGA score of 0 (312/763), the mean total duration of time to disease worsening following treatment discontinuation was approximately 130 days. We believe these additional clinical observations confirm the long-term effectiveness of VTAMA cream 1% QD and differentiate it from other topical therapies. 
 VTAMA for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis 
 Clinical data 
 In 2017, GSK completed a multi-center randomized, double-blind, vehicle cream-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of VTAMA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in 247 adult (aged 18 to 65 years) and adolescent (aged 12 to 17 years) patients. Patients were randomized equally to six treatment groups: VTAMA cream 0.5%, VTAMA cream 1% or vehicle cream, each applied to atopic dermatitis lesions either QD or BID. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a minimum two-point improvement in the Investigator Global Assessment (“IGA”) score and an assessment of “clear” or “almost clear” skin at week 12. These cases were considered a “treatment success.” Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with at least a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from baseline. Efficacy was evaluated in the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) population. 
 Overall, the percentage of patients achieving treatment success was much higher for both VTAMA concentrations than vehicle cream, with a robust dose response. 53% of patients who applied VTAMA cream 1% BID and 46% of those who applied it QD were considered a treatment success. This compares favorably to the 24% and 28% of pateints who achieved a treatment success for the BID and QD vehicle cream groups, respectively. At week 12, 60% and 51% of patients treated with VTAMA cream 1% BID and QD, respectively, achieved EASI75. The treatment effect across adults and adolescents was observed to be consistent. Patient-reported outcome data was collected during the Phase 2b clinical trial, including data on reduction in the severity of pruritus. At week 12, more patients treated with VTAMA cream 1% (78% of patients treated BID and 87% of patients treated QD) reported “moderately improved” to “very improved” pruritus, compared to patients treated with vehicle cream (47% of patients treated BID and 64% of patients treated QD).

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


VTAMA was observed to be well-tolerated in this Phase 2b trial for atopic dermatitis, with the majority of AEs reported as mild or moderate in severity. In the trial, AEs were considered treatment-related (“TEAEs”) in 10% to 19% of patients across the treatment arms. The most commonly reported TEAEs were folliculitis, application-site pain and atopic dermatitis. TEAEs led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 4% of dosed patients (seven patients from treatment groups total) compared to 7% of patients receiving vehicle cream (six patients total). Only one patient (tapinarof 1% BID) experienced a SAE of anxiety and hyperactive disorder, which was not considered to be related to treatment. 
 Development plan 
 In September 2021, we dosed our first patent in the ADORING 1 and ADORING 2 trials, two identically designed, multi-center, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind parallel Phase 3 clinical trials of VTAMA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We expect to release topline data from these studies in the first half of calendar year 2023. The two trials will enroll up to 800 patients across both trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VTAMA cream, 1% dosed once daily for 8 weeks versus vehicle cream QD in patients aged two years and older who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The primary endpoint of both studies will be the percentage of patients achieving a Validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD™), of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline at week 8. 
 Additionally, we have initiated ADORING 3, a long-term, open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VTAMA cream 1% in patients with atopic dermatitis. Subjects in the study will include those who have previously completed treatment with VTAMA or vehicle in ADORING 1 or ADORING 2, as well as 
 
18 

  subjects who have completed a maximal use PK study, and those pediatric subjects who would not qualify for inclusion in ADORING 1 or 2 due to milder or more severe disease. ADORING 3 will consist of up to 48 weeks of VTAMA cream 1%, and a 7-day safety follow-up period. 
 Potential Benefits of VTAMA—Limitations of Current Treatments 
 VTAMA in plaque psoriasis 
 We believe VTAMA has several key attributes that position it favorably over current standard of care treatments in plaque psoriasis, including TCS therapies: 
 



Based on the clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in psoriasis symptoms VTAMA demonstrated in both Phase 3 trials, coupled with no label restrictions on duration of use and no label safety warnings or precautions, we believe VTAMA will be used broadly and potentially chronically on any skin lesion regardless of location on the body. We believe the Phase 3 data we have generated and the data observed in our open-label, long-term extension study support the chronic use of VTAMA, potentially in place of other topical and oral treatments, for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe plaque psoriasis in adults. 
 VTAMA’s potential in atopic dermatitis 
 TCS, especially low-to-mid potency TCS, represent the standard-of-care for atopic dermatitis treatment. Although they are used commonly, TCS pose a specific concern in pediatric patients due to the risk of systemic absorption, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, skin thinning and other potential side effects. The increased body surface area to mass ratio in children results in increased absorption and systemic exposure. The American Academy of Dermatology guidelines suggest limiting long-term use of TCS in children to avoid the risk of systemic side effects. As such, 86% of U.S. patients report dissatisfaction with current treatment options for atopic dermatitis according to the National Eczema Association. There is also considerable concern among many parents about treating their children with steroids, which can be an obstacle to treatment for physicians. Due to these risks and patient dissatisfaction, health care providers are less likely to use them long-term in children and also in sensitive skin areas such as the face or diaper/groin area. In addition, topical PDE4 inhibitors 
 
19 

  developed to treat atopic dermatitis have been associated with side effects including application site burning and stinging. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an additional non-steroidal option for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis; however, their use has been limited by safety including boxed warnings of malignancy (e.g., skin and lymphoma) having been reported in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. 
 Patients whose disease flares despite topical treatments may be prescribed systemic agents such as oral corticosteroids or oral cyclosporine to rapidly relieve severe signs and symptoms of the disease. While these are effective as temporary treatments of flare-ups, extended use has been associated with many potential side effects or adverse events. Systemic steroids, such as prednisone, can lead to symptom relief, but their use is not recommended to induce stable remission due to numerous side effects associated with steroids and the propensity of severe disease flares upon abrupt treatment cessation. Cyclosporine is also generally not recommended for use lasting longer than one to two years, as it has been associated with renal toxicity, hirsutism, nausea and lymphoma. Based on data from the 2014 Adelphi U.S. AD Disease Specific Program, over 58% of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis have disease which physicians consider to be inadequately controlled by these therapeutic modalities. While biologic therapies are more efficacious, as is the case in psoriasis, use of therapies such as the recently approved Dupixent is limited to patients with significant disease burden as they are expensive, necessitate frequent injections, entail regular physician appointments, have potential systemic toxicities and often require laboratory monitoring. Additionally, recent FDA action regarding JAK inhibitors has resulted in restrictive labeling and black box warnings relating to safety concerns with the product class, both oral and topical forms, including for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis. 
 We believe VTAMA has the potential to fill the need for a long-term treatment option for atopic dermatitis. We also believe that VTAMA has the potential to offer significant clinical advancement to address the incessant flare cycle experienced by atopic dermatitis patients that is the result of the short-term use limitation of standard-of-care TCS. 
 VTAMA sales and marketing potential in atopic dermatitis 
 If VTAMA is approved by the FDA for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, we plan to expand our psoriasis sales team to be able to reach additional specialists who see a significant amount of atopic dermatitis patients, such as pediatric dermatologists and allergists. Based on our commercial team’s experience developing and launching dermatology products in U.S., we believe we can effectively reach the psoriasis and atopic dermatitis core target base with a highly specialized sales team of 125 to 150 total sales representatives. 
 DMVT-506 for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases 
 DMVT-506 is an early stage drug candidate that is a novel AhR agonist with a similar activity profile to VTAMA. We are evaluating DMVT-506 as a potential differentiated treatment option for immunology and inflammatory diseases. DMVT-506 is a unique, new chemical entity protected by a composition of matter patent having a natural expiration date in 2041.

Batoclimab 
 Batoclimab is a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and inhibits FcRn. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, batoclimab has been observed to reduce IgG antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe batoclimab has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. 
 In addition to generating clinically meaningful IgG reductions, batoclimab has been designed from inception to be a fixed-dose, self-administered SC injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule. Batoclimab has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. We believe that batoclimab, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. The patent family directed to the composition of matter of batoclimab has a natural projected expiration date in 2035 in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. 
 In several nonclinical studies and in a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous and SC delivery of batoclimab was generally well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent IgG antibody reductions. In the highest dose cohorts in the Phase 1 clinical trial, four weekly SC administrations of 680 mg resulted in a mean maximum reduction of serum IgG levels of 78%, with a standard deviation of 2%. Injection site reactions were similar between batoclimab and placebo arms. 
 Mechanism of action 
 The neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor, or FcRn plays a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies. The physiologic function of FcRn is to modulate the catabolism of IgG antibodies. FcRn intercepts IgG, which would otherwise be degraded in lysosomes. The FcRn-IgG complex is then recycled to the 
 
22 

  cell surface and free IgG is released back into circulation. Anti-FcRn antibodies bind to FcRn, thereby preventing it from recycling IgG antibodies back to circulation. As a result, IgG is increasingly delivered to lysosomes for degradation. The inhibition of FcRn, such as through use of an anti-FcRn antibody, has been shown to reduce levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, suggesting utility in the many autoimmune diseases associated with high levels of such IgG antibodies. 
 Batoclimab for the Treatment of MG 
 MG overview 
 MG is an autoimmune disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration. Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine receptor (“AChR”) antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. 
 The prevalence of MG is estimated to be 17.8 per 100,000, with up to 59,000 cases in the U.S. Third-party studies estimate the prevalence in Europe for MG as 24.2 per 100,000, or approximately 126,000 cases. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in individuals between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in individuals over 50 years old and predominantly affects males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified. 
 The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital. 
 Very early stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies via plasma exchange or a variant of this plasma exchange, immunoadsorption. The most recent agents approved for MG are eculizumab and ravulizumab-cwvz, two complement C5 inhibitors, the use of which are limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment, was recently approved for the treatment of MG in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. We believe there is room to 
 
23 

  improve upon this current treatment paradigm for MG, as some of these treatments can leave patients with burdensome administration requirements, significant side effects or long wait times to see treatment effect. 
 Clinical data 
 In 2019, we initiated a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of batoclimab for the treatment of MG. As evaluated in a pre-specified, pooled analysis of 15 subjects who completed Day 42 of the trial, batoclimab-treated subjects (N=10) showed a clinical improvement in both the MG-ADL scale and the MGC scale. We believe, based upon our review of data from this Phase 2a trial of batoclimab in MG, that there is sufficient proof of concept to pursue a pivotal trial to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of MG. 
 Development plan 
 As previously disclosed in December 2021, we achieved alignment with the FDA Division of Neurology 1 to move forward with our pivotal trial of batoclimab as a treatment for MG. We have initiated our Phase 3 study in MG which is now open for enrollment. We expect top-line data from this Phase 3 trial to be available in the second half of calendar year 2024. 
 Our trial is designed to address unmet patient needs and differentiate batoclimab from other treatments. Key features of the trial include: 
 

• | 12-week Induction Period: Includes doses of 680 mg SC injection weekly (“SC QW”) or anchor dose of 340 mg SC QW compared to placebo. The objective is to achieve maximum efficacy at the beginning of treatment and determine the potential benefit of 680 mg SC QW (i.e., speed and depth of clinical response).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 12-week Maintenance Period: Includes anchor doses of 340 mg SC QW and 340 mg SC injection once every two weeks compared to placebo to assess lower effective maintenance doses with potentially fewer side effects related to long term IgG suppression or serum analyte changes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 52-week Long Term Extension: Includes long term safety assessment of the 2 maintenance doses; also includes tailored dosing allowing for treatment of disease exacerbations with short-term, re-induction dosing of batoclimab (680 mg SC QW x 4 weeks) followed by resumption of 340 mg SC QW.

  Batoclimab for the Treatment of TED 
 TED overview 
 TED, also referred to as Graves’ Ophthalmopathy or GO, is a sight-threatening autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and tissues surrounding the eyes. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision, and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. At diagnosis, many patients with TED have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes, and protrusion of their eyeballs (proptosis). In some cases, swelling and stiffness of the eye muscles prevent the eyes from working together causing double vision. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease causing intense pain, inflammation, sight-threatening corneal ulcers, or optic neuropathy requiring surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED patients. 
 TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (“TSHR”). These anti-TSHR antibodies activate cells in the extraocular space that highly express TSHR, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Fibroblast activation causes cell proliferation and the production of hyaluronan, a substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes leading to extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling. Adipocyte activation leads to hyperplasia of the adipose tissue surrounding the eye causing protrusion of the eyeballs and compression of the optic nerve. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis. Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, leads to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms. 
 In addition to anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (“IGF1R”) may also contribute to TED. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation of similar biochemical pathways implicated in TED. Published studies investing this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggests that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist. 
 TED has an estimated annual incidence of 9.7 in 100,000 in the U.S. and 4.8 in 100,000 in Europe. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Treatment of patients with immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States have active inflammatory TED each year and are eligible for treatment with therapy directed at the causative anti-TSHR antibodies. 
 As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high doses of corticosteroids, typically administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately one-third of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. 
 Orbital radiation therapy is used as a means of reducing the infiltration of lymphocytes and can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Similar to these anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy is most effective in the active stage of TED. 
 
25 

  Patients with moderate-to-severe active TED not responding to corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, two broad immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs are associated with numerous side effects related both to their general immunosuppressive effects as well as to inherent toxicities, such as hypertension, kidney disease and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
 Small case studies have identified rituximab as an alternate way of inducing immunosuppression in patients with TED. Rituximab (Roche) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to B cells, leading to their destruction. However, rituximab is associated with the potential for serious side effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Rare cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy and other viral infections have also been reported. 
 Surgery is considered to be a treatment option in patients with a highly active disease who have been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy but continue to have progressive disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the pressure causing proptosis, reduced eye movement and loss of visual acuity. Because of its invasive nature, surgery is typically reserved for inactive disease. 
 Clinical data 
 In 2019, we initiated an open-label, single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial of batoclimab for the treatment of TED. The majority of subjects (four of seven) evaluated at the end of treatment experienced a greater than or equal to 2-point improvement in clinical activity score (CAS). Three of seven subjects were proptosis responders; a proptosis response was defined as a greater than or equal to 2mm improvement in the study eye. 
 In 2019, we initiated a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of batoclimab in TED. Our voluntary pause in dosing in February 2021 resulted in unblinding this trial and the primary endpoint was not significant. However, our analysis of exploratory endpoints from this trial increased our confidence in the anti-FcRn mechanism of action for patients with TED, and they provide part of the basis for our interest in moving forward with further development of TED. 
 Development plan 
 We recently achieved alignment with the FDA Division of Ophthalmology to move forward in TED. We plan to initiate two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate batoclimab for the treatment of TED in the second half of calendar year 2022. For each of the two Phase 3 trials of batoclimab in TED, we expect that approximately 100 subjects will enter the trial and be randomized to either a treatment arm or placebo arm. Subjects randomized to the treatment arm will be dosed with 680 mg of batoclimab QW for 12 weeks followed by 340 mg of batoclimab QW for 12 weeks. This batoclimab-treated group of subjects will be compared to subjects that are dosed with placebo QW for 24 weeks. This treatment period will last for 24 weeks and the primary efficacy endpoint will be measured as proptosis responders at Week 24 vs placebo where responders are defined as ≥ 2 mm reduction from baseline in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration of ≥ 2 mm increase in the fellow eye. We expect top-line results from both Phase 3 trials to be available in the first half of calendar year 2025. 
 Batoclimab for the Treatment of WAIHA 
 WAIHA overview 
 WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”). The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes non-specific symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically develop chronically over several weeks to months; however rapid progression over a span of days has also been observed. 
 In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body’s oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. Though the exact causes of WAIHA are unknown, roughly half of cases occur in patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. 
 
26 

  In WAIHA, autoantibodies react with surface proteins on RBCs at temperatures at or above 37° Celsius, or normal body temperature. These antibodies are of the IgG subtype in most patients. WAIHA is differentiated from cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or cold agglutinin disease, which shares a similar clinical presentation but is triggered by autoantibodies that react at temperatures below 37° Celsius. In WAIHA, antibody-coated RBCs are removed from circulation primarily in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. Studies have suggested the severity of WAIHA correlates with the amount and potency of autoantibodies present. 
 The annual incidence of WAIHA in the United States and Europe is estimated at one to three in 100,000 persons. Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 40,000 patients in the U.S. and 71,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The disease may be more common in females, with some sources suggesting a 2:1 female predominance. Peak incidence occurs during the sixth and seventh decades of life, however, WAIHA can occur in children as well. 
 High doses of corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg of prednisone) are typically the first-line treatment option for WAIHA and lead to initial disease control in approximately 70-85% of cases. Once initial disease control is achieved, doses of steroids are tapered. However, only 33% of patients maintain sustained disease control once steroids are discontinued and, as a result, the majority of patients will require either long-term steroid treatment or additional therapies. 
 Patients with persistent disease despite use of corticosteroids and rituximab may be offered a course of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine sirolimus. 
 RBC transfusions are indicated in patients who require immediate stabilization. Such patients are monitored closely for evidence of a transfusion reaction. In contrast to other treatment modalities that lead to nonspecific suppression of the immune system, batoclimab may offer a more targeted approach for reducing levels of the causative IgG species responsible for most cases of WAIHA. We believe this could provide a favorable therapeutic window and avoid the significant side effects associated with less targeted immunosuppression. 
 Development plan 
 Following expected discussions with the hematology division of the FDA, we intend to initiate a randomized, placebo-controlled study of batoclimab as a treatment for WAIHA.

  Batoclimab and Atorvastatin drug-drug interaction (“DDI”) trial 
 In March 2022, we announced that we initiated a Phase 1 DDI study in healthy volunteers to characterize the PK profile of atorvastatin (40 mg daily (“q day”) with and without the coadministration of batoclimab 680 mg SC QW (see figure below). Key secondary objectives are to compare the change from baseline in lipid levels observed with SC QW batoclimab (680 mg or 340 mg SC) alone or in combination with varying doses of atorvastatin. Preliminary results from the initial 2 cohorts dosed in the study (680 mg SC QW with and without 40 mg atorvastatin q day) suggest that, at these doses, atorvastatin negates the batoclimab-induced increase in LDL-cholesterol. We believe, based on these preliminary data and feedback from physicians, that a batoclimab-induced increase in LDL-cholesterol can be managed with anti-lipid therapy as needed. Results from the additional cohorts studied are expected to be available by the end of calendar year 2022. 
 

QW = weekly, QD = daily, SC = subcutaneous injection 
 Potential New Indications 
 We continue to evaluate potential new indications for batoclimab by considering a number of factors including, but not limited to, degree of unmet medical need, potential benefit offered by the treatment, target patient population size, and commercial potential. 
 We have identified additional attractive indications with high unmet need and scientific rationale for anti-FcRn therapy. We also believe that certain indications with existing anti-FcRn programs offer a significant opportunity to provide unique patient benefits and therefore represent a strong potential opportunity. As previously disclosed, we plan to announce two new indications by August 2022.

• | Proteovant is focused on the discovery and development of a robust pipeline of protein degraders targeting indications in oncology and immunology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Protein degradation:
--+---------------------


• | Protein degraders are a novel class of small molecules that target and destroy cellular proteins, rather than inhibiting them. Degraders are engineered to induce the degradation of specific disease-causing proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which ordinarily tags and degrades proteins that have been misfolded or have already fulfilled their biological function.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In heterobifunctional degraders, the protein ligand domain, commonly referred to as a “warhead,” targets the specific protein of interest. At the other end of the complex, the ligase ligand recruits a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. Both ends of the complex are connected by a linker that orients the target protein and E3 ligase in a cooperative ternary complex, driving ubiquitination. Similar to heterobifunctional degraders, molecular-glue-type degraders are small molecules that induce a novel interaction between a ligand of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein, leading to proteolysis of the target via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe degraders represent a promising new approach to drug previously “undruggable” targets and transform the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need. Degraders open a new set of opportunities for small molecule drug development and have multiple distinct potential advantages over inhibitors, including that they:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are not bound by “inhibitory” requirements, meaning they can target historically “undruggable” proteins, including transcription factors and scaffolding proteins that lack a catalytic pocket;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
Nucleic acid therapeutics represent an emerging modality that we believe may overcome challenges associated with traditional small molecule drug development in the treatment of genetically defined disease. The 

31 


vast majority of human proteins are considered “undruggable” by small molecules based on their protein structure. Nucleic acid therapeutics circumvent the question of whether or not a target is undruggable by impacting protein expression itself. 
The field of nucleic acid therapeutics has gained significant momentum in recent years, with FDA approval of Alnylam’s Onpattro and Givlaari (givosiran), and approval of multiple mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. There is a substantial pipeline of nucleic acid therapeutics in clinical development that further underscores the transformative potential of nucleic acid therapeutics in the near term. However, nucleic acid therapeutics remain challenged by obstacles in the delivery of nucleic acids to specific cell types. RNA molecules cannot passively cross most cell membranes given their large size and negative charge, and therefore must be administered in conjunction with a delivery technology to ensure transport to target cell types. 
We work with two proprietary technologies, LNP delivery and ligand conjugate delivery, to improve the likelihood of clinical success of nucleic acid therapeutics. We licensed intellectual property with respect to each of these technologies from Arbutus Biopharma in 2018. 
We are focused on expanding our platforms into novel tissue types by leveraging the scientific expertise of several members of the technical team that originally developed or advanced the technologies at Arbutus and its predecessors. 
Lipid Nanoparticle Platform 
Our LNP technology platform is designed to deliver nucleic acids, including mRNA, siRNA, antisense and gene editing constructs. 
Some key features of our LNP technology are: 


1. | Multi-component formulations that contain specialized lipids optimized for potency and tolerability, are capable of encapsulating a broad range of nucleic acid payloads, and have limited constraints on nucleic acid composition, structure or size
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A manufacturing process developed and scaled to produce stable uniform dispersion of colloidal nanoparticles with particle size appropriate for parenteral or intramuscular administration
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Efficient intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to cell cytoplasm via engineered active endosomal escape mechanism
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




32 


In a head-to-head study comparing multiple LNP formulations varying only the key ionizable lipid, a newer Genevant formulation outperformed third-party formulations. In particular, our formulation showed superior potency and avoidance of immune stimulation relative to others, including when compared with the LNP utilized in the first FDA-approved RNA-LNP therapeutic, Alnylam’s Onpattro (“MC3” in figure below). 
Genevant LNP Outperformed Third-Party LNPs in Head-to-Head Study 


* Key lipid of first FDA-approved siRNA-LNP (Alnylam’s Onpattro) 
In addition, Genevant LNP technology has entered the clinic with more than a dozen distinct product candidates, representing hundreds of subjects of clinical experience. 

33 


Substantial clinical experience with Genevant LNP technology 


With this track record of success, we are now also focusing our LNP capabilities on historically challenging cell and tissue types, including hepatic stellate cells (“HSCs”). 
Historically, attempts to address certain diseases have been limited by the inability to access specific cell types outside of the hepatocyte. We have demonstrated our ability to deliver nucleic acid therapeutics to challenging targets by accessing HSCs in preclinical studies. The activation of HSCs is well established as a central driver of fibrosis, and thus technologies that target activated HSCs may be key to addressing certain liver diseases. 
In preclinical studies, delivery of RNAi to HSCs via Genevant’s LNP technology demonstrated selective knockdown of an HSC target with minimal activity in hepatocytes, as shown below. Additional preclinical studies support our ability to design LNPs to deliver nucleic acids to the lung, and we believe that our scientific expertise will over time lead to the ability to direct LNPs toward additional cell and tissue types, such as the central nervous system, immune cells and the eye. 

34 


LNP delivery of siRNA to HSCs demonstrated selective knockdown of target mRNA in mice with minimal activity in hepatocytes 


Ligand Conjugate Platform 
In addition to our LNP platform, we also have a proprietary RNAi ligand conjugate platform. Novel ligands can successfully deliver siRNA and certain other oligonucleotides to hepatocytes, and our expertise enables the design of novel ligands with the potential to expand delivery capability to other cell types such as hepatic stellate cells. Our ligand conjugate technology has demonstrated equal or better preclinical potency, assessed by duration and magnitude of knockdown compared to current industry benchmark. We currently have an allowed US patent and multiple patent applications pending with respect to our ligand conjugate platform. 

35 





We are developing a next-generation ligand conjugate platform that we refer to as “RNAi 2.0.” Our RNAi 2.0 platform has demonstrated superior strength and duration of knockdown compared to legacy ligand conjugates (“RNAi 1.0”) in a head-to-head preclinical study in nonhuman primates. In addition, our RNAi 2.0 platform: 


• | Contains intrinsic endosomolytic properties
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Has demonstrated marked in vivo enhancement in potency
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Has maintained a subcutaneous dosing regimen and is expected to be dosed subcutaneously in clinical trials
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Remains compatible with other ligand types
--+-------------------------------------------

Priovant Overview 


• | Overview:
--+----------


• | Priovant is developing brepocitinib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1, for the treatment of dermatomyositis (“DM”), systemic lupus erythematosus (“SLE”) and other immune-mediated diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lead program:
--+--------------


• | Brepocitinib is a potentially first-in-class, orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of TYK2 and JAK1 that suppresses signaling of TYK2- and JAK1-dependent cytokines linked to autoimmunity, including type I and type II interferon, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disease overview:
--+------------------


• | DM is a chronic, immune-mediated disease of the skin and muscles. Patients with DM usually present with a characteristic skin rash and proximal muscle weakness, which may lead to significant functional impairment or disfigurement. Patients with DM are at a substantially increased risk of interstitial lung disease, malignancy, and heart failure, contributing to an estimated 5-year mortality rate of 10-40%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SLE is a chronic, immune-mediated connective tissue disease that can impact nearly all major organ systems. The most common manifestations of SLE are cutaneous and musculoskeletal symptoms, although neurological, gastrointestinal, hematological, and renal symptoms are regularly observed as well. Patients with SLE are at a substantially increased risk of infection and cardiovascular disease, contributing to estimated 10- and 15-year mortality rates of 9% and 15%, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate that there are approximately 37,000 adult DM patients and up to 300,000 adult SLE patients in the US.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limitations of current treatments:
--+-----------------------------------


• | Corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (“DMARDs”), and immunosuppressants, administered alone or in combination, are traditional therapies for patients with DM and SLE. Many of these therapies are associated with significant toxicities and limited efficacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For patients with DM who do not respond adequately to traditional therapies, IVIg (OCTAGAM 10%) is an important FDA-approved treatment. However, clinical trial data from the Phase 3 ProDERM study of IVIg in patients with DM and case reports from years of prior off-label use confirm that even with IVIg, many patients with DM continue to suffer from residual disease activity. Moreover, IVIg administration is burdensome, typically requiring several hours of infusion therapy for multiple days each month. IVIg also has a black box warning for serious risks, including thrombosis and kidney failure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For patients with SLE who do not respond adequately to traditional therapies, belimumab (BENLYSTA) and anifrolumab (SAPHNELO) are FDA-approved biologic treatments. However, in each of belimumab’s BLISS Phase 3 program and anifrolumab’s TULIP Phase 3 program, the clinical trial data demonstrates that many patients failed to respond to these therapies, and both therapies are administered intravenously or subcutaneously.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical data:
--+---------------


• | Brepocitinib has been evaluated in five completed placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies in immune-mediated diseases (psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, alopecia areata, and hidradenitis suppurativa). In all five of these studies, treatment with brepocitinib was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful efficacy.

• | Brepocitinib’s safety database includes over 1,000 exposed participants evaluated in 14 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and three ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. In these studies, brepocitinib was generally safe and well-tolerated, and rates of JAK class treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) of interest were comparable to those observed in the development programs of approved JAK inhibitors. Collectively, these data suggest a safety profile that is similar to those of approved JAK inhibitors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Brepocitinib has not been evaluated in DM to-date. However, several FDA-approved JAK inhibitors have been clinically validated in DM patients refractory to standard-of-care therapies, as reported in more than 100 off-label case reports and in an open-label clinical trial. In addition, since DM pathobiology is driven by dysregulations in cytokines whose signaling is mediated by both TYK2 and JAK1, we believe that, with its unique dual inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1, brepocitinib, as compared to inhibitors selective to either TYK2 or JAK1 has the potential to demonstrate superior clinical efficacy in DM.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Brepocitinib has not been evaluated in SLE to-date. However, FDA-approved and investigational JAK inhibitors have completed successful proof-of-concept studies in SLE patients. And, like DM, SLE pathobiology is driven by dysregulations in cytokines whose signaling is mediated by both TYK2 and JAK1. We believe that, with its unique dual inhibition of both TYK2 and JAK1, brepocitinib, as compared to inhibitors selective to either TYK2 or JAK1, has the potential to demonstrate superior clinical efficacy in SLE.

Kinevant Overview 


• | Overview:
--+----------


• | Kinevant is focused on developing namilumab for sarcoidosis and potentially other diseases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lead program:
--+--------------


• | Namilumab is a fully human anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody with broad potential in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases being developed with potentially the least frequent dosing schedule among subcutaneous anti-GM-CSFs in Phase 2 clinical trials, with a single dose every four weeks after an initial loading period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disease overview:
--+------------------


• | Sarcoidosis is a multi-system inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas believed to be formed by an exaggerated immune response to unidentified antigens. Sarcoidosis primarily affects the lungs and lymphatic system, though sarcoidosis may damage any organ. GM-CSF, a key pathogenic cytokine, has been implicated in multiple parts of the granulomatous response.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sarcoidosis affects approximately 200,000 people in the United States, with over 90% of cases presenting with pulmonary involvement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An estimated 54% of pulmonary sarcoidosis patients are diagnosed, and approximately 90% of these patients receive some form of treatment. Market research with HCPs and third-party analysis of claims data suggest that approximately 25% of diagnosed and treated pulmonary sarcoidosis would be eligible for treatment with second-line or later therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limitations of current treatments:
--+-----------------------------------


• | Corticosteroids are the most widely used treatment for sarcoidosis, but they carry significant side effects when used longer-term. Second- and third-line treatment options, including immunosuppressive therapies and biologics, are limited by slow onset, safety risk, inconsistent effectiveness, and reimbursement challenges, leaving significant unmet medical need that could be met by a novel biologic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical data:
--+---------------


• | Early clinical data in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and subsequent Phase 2 studies showed namilumab to be well-tolerated with a single subcutaneous injection given up to every four weeks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a Phase 1 study of healthy volunteers with a single subcutaneous injection, namilumab was observed to be generally well-tolerated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a Phase 2 trial in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis conducted by Takeda, namilumab demonstrated decreased disease activity compared to placebo. In this trial, patients were given a subcutaneous injection of either 20, 80, or 150 mg of namilumab four times over a ten-week period. Over the 12-week study period, 14 of 27 (52%) subjects receiving placebo and 45 of 81 (56%) receiving namilumab experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis, dyspnea, bronchitis, and headache.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development plan and upcoming milestones:

Hemavant Overview 


• | Overview:
--+----------


• | Hemavant is developing RVT-2001, a small molecule SF3B1 modulator, for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lead program:
--+--------------


• | RVT-2001 is a potentially first-in-class, orally administered, small molecule SF3B1 modulator that corrects SF3B1 mutation-induced splicing defects in mRNA transcripts that encode proteins thought to be associated with the development of MDS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disease overview:
--+------------------


• | Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of hematologic malignancies in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and become healthy blood cells. MDS patients are at risk for symptoms related to anemia, infection and bleeding, and they have variable survival expectations and rates of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Assessment of prognosis is a key aspect in selecting therapy for the patient with MDS, and prognostic models broadly differentiate patients into either lower-risk MDS or higher-risk MDS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe that there are approximately 115,000 MDS patients in the US, with approximately 17,000 new MDS cases per year, two thirds of which are lower-risk MDS.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limitations of current treatments:
--+-----------------------------------


• | Chronic anemia in patients with MDS requires regular and repeated red blood cell (“RBC”) transfusions, creating a significant burden for patients and an increased risk of organ toxicity from iron overload.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One of the primary goals of treatment is to reduce or eliminate RBC transfusion dependence while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. The first line of treatment for most lower-risk MDS patients consists of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (“ESAs”), which are ineffective in over 50% of patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For patients who fail ESAs, the available treatment options depend on mutational status and disease phenotypes. In 2020, Reblozyl (luspatercept) became the only FDA-approved therapy for lower-risk MDS patients who are ring sideroblast positive and who have failed an ESA. Although Reblozyl can lead to transfusion independence, it is ineffective in over 50% of patients and is most effective in patients with a low transfusion burden. Reblozyl is delivered as an injection and is associated with numerous adverse events, including fatigue, a significant concern for patients already experiencing fatigue from anemia.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical data:
--+---------------


• | In the dose-escalation portion of an ongoing Phase 1/2 study, over 30% (6/19) of patients with lower-risk, transfusion-dependent MDS treated with RVT-2001 became RBC-transfusion independent (“RBC-TI”), with a median duration of treatment of approximately two years for responders. The dose-escalation portion of the study was conducted in a highly refractory patient population, which we believe may have decreased the observed treatment response relative to what would be expected in a less refractory target population.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the dose-escalation portion of this ongoing Phase 1/2 study, which had a total of 84 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or MDS, RVT-2001 was observed to be generally well-tolerated, with the majority of events being classified as Grade 1.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development plan and upcoming milestones:
--+------------------------------------------


• | We have amended the IND for the ongoing open-label Phase 1/2 trial to add a dose-optimization cohort. We are enrolling a less refractory patient population in the dose-optimization cohort than the
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


44 


 
population from which the first 19 lower-risk, transfusion-dependent MDS patients were drawn during the dose-escalation portion by excluding patients with prior exposure to lenalidomide or hypomethylating agents. We are targeting a genetically defined subpopulations by enrolling only lower-risk MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations. In addition, we are evaluating baseline expression of TMEM14C transcripts as a potential biomarker predictive of response to RVT-2001, since among the 7 MDS patients with the highest levels of aberrant TMEM14C transcripts in the dose-escalation portion of this Phase 1/2 trial, 71% (5/7) became RBC-TI. We also aim to strengthen the phamacodynamic effect by optimizing the dosage of RVT-2001. We expect data from the dose-optimization cohort of the Phase 1/2 trial to be available in 2023.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our initial plan is to position RVT-3002 as second line therapy in SF3B1-mutated patients, with the potential to expand to other spliceosome mutations and ultimately first line treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Roivant ownership:

Affivant Overview 


• | Overview:
--+----------


• | Affivant is focused on the future development and commercialization of AFVT-2101 and other bispecific antibodies through its licensing and strategic collaboration agreement with Affimed to develop and commercialize novel innate cell engagers for multiple cancer targets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lead program:
--+--------------


• | AFVT-2101 is a preclinical immune-engaging bispecific antibody licensed from Affimed with potential applicability to several solid tumor indications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bispecific innate cell engagers (“ICE”), which are generated by Affimed’s Redirected Optimized Cell Killing (“ROCK”) platform technology, are a novel class of drugs that activate the innate immune system and trigger a concerted anti-tumoral immune response. These bispecific antibodies consist of tumor-associated antigen binding domains, which cause high affinity and high specificity binding to the tumor surface, and immune cell binding domains, which bind and activate specific immune cell subsets able to kill the tumor cell.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AFVT-2101 is an ICE program whose Fc region is fused to two high affinity CD16A binding single chain variable regions to maximize NK cell and macrophage engagement. The biological target of AFVT-2101’s tumor-associated antigen binding domain has been clinically validated via other targeted agents (mAb and ADC), including both evidence of single agent activity and a generally well-tolerated safety profile of the corresponding mAb in published studies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe AFVT-2101 has potential applicability across several highly prevalent solid tumor types, providing the optionality to pursue multiple large-market indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical data:
--+------------------


• | In a head-to-head preclinical study, AFVT-2101’s potency, as measured by target cell killing, exceeded that of a monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) that has been clinically validated against the same tumor target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AFVT-2101’s potency also exceeded the potency of antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC”) agents that have been clinically validated against the same tumor target, as reported in published preclinical studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Based on preclinical and clinical experiences with other ICE antibodies in separate studies, we believe that the tolerability of AFVT-2101 has the potential to be superior to that observed to date with ADCs in published literature.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Development plan and upcoming milestones:
--+------------------------------------------


• | We expect to file an IND for AFVT-2101 in the first half of calendar year 2023.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuant to a collaboration and licensing agreement between Affivant and Affimed, Affimed is conducting a significant portion of the AFVT-2101 preclinical work for the collaboration under the governance of a Joint Steering Committee controlled by Affivant.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuant to the agreement Affivant will be responsible for submitting any IND or equivalent for AFVT-2101, and will be responsible for all future clinical development and commercialization worldwide, with Affimed retaining an option for co-promotion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We also have the option to license from Affimed additional ICE molecules directed against targets that are not (a) currently licensed or optioned to third parties or (b) directed against targets included in Affimed’s current pipeline.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Roivant ownership:

In May 2021, DSG, as seller, entered into a Revenue Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “RIPSA”) with XYQ Luxco, NovaQuest Co-Investment Fund XVII, L.P., an affiliate of NovaQuest Capital Management, LLC, and MAM Tapir Lender, LLC, an affiliate of Marathon Asset Management, L.P. (collectively, the “Purchasers”), together with U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. 
In June 2022, following satisfaction of the funding conditions set forth in the RIPSA, including receipt of marketing approval from the FDA for VTAMA (received in May 2022), the Purchasers paid DSG a total of $160.0 million in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the RIPSA (the “Purchase Price”). In consideration therefor, each of the Purchasers has the right to receive a low single-digit to high single-digit tiered percentage of quarterly revenues based on the achievement of specified net sales thresholds for VTAMA in the U.S., up to a cap of $344.0 million. Payments of such quarterly revenues to the Purchasers under the RIPSA are secured by a security interest in certain VTAMA-related assets, including intellectual property rights and certain other assets that are owned by, licensed to or otherwise controlled by DSG related to the development and commercialization of VTAMA. 
The RIPSA contains certain representations and warranties and covenants applicable to DSL and its subsidiaries. The RIPSA also contains certain Events of Default (as defined in the RIPSA) such as the breach of payment and other obligations, bankruptcy-related events and cross-defaults with respect to other related documents and agreements creating indebtedness. The occurrence of an Event of Default following the Purchasers’ funding of the Purchase Price triggers DSG’s obligation to pay an Event of Default Fee (as defined in the RIPSA) of $160.0 million, less revenue payments previously paid, as liquidated damages. In addition, the occurrence of a change of control of DSG prior to the Purchasers funding the Purchase Price triggers DSG’s right, but not the obligation, to terminate the RIPSA by payment of the Pre-Funding Change of Control Option Price (as defined in the RIPSA) to all of the Purchasers, which varies based on the date of termination and certain milestones with respect to VTAMA. 
Dermavant Financing Agreements—Dermavant Credit Agreement with XYQ Luxco 
In May 2021, our subsidiaries Dermavant Sciences Ltd. (“DSL”), Dermavant Holdings Limited, Dermavant Sciences IRL Limited and DSG, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), and certain other subsidiaries of DSL, as initial guarantors, entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with XYQ Luxco, as lender, and U.S. Bank National Association, as collateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan of $40.0 million (the “Term Loan”), the proceeds of which were used by the Borrowers to repay in full and terminate an existing credit facility with Hercules Capital Inc., with the remaining proceeds to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
The Term Loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 10.0% per annum, with interest paid quarterly in arrears until maturity in May 2026, at which time the principal amount is due. The Borrowers have the option to prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part, subject to (i) until May 2023, a prepayment premium of 5.0% of the principal amount being repaid (plus the present value of all future scheduled interest on the principal being prepaid that would accrue through May 2023 calculated based on a discount rate equal to the treasury rate plus 100 basis points, except in the event the prepayment is due to a change of control), (ii) from May 2023 to May 2024, a prepayment premium of 5.0% of the principal amount being repaid, and (iii) from May 2024 to May 

48 


2025, a prepayment premium of 2.5% of the principal amount being repaid. From May 2025 through maturity, the Term Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part without a prepayment premium. Optional and mandatory prepayment of the Term Loan, as well as other forms of prepayment, repayment, applications or reductions, will also require that DSL pays an Exit Fee (as defined in the Credit Agreement), calculated based on the amount so prepaid, repaid, applied or reduced. 
The Borrowers’ obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the initial guarantors and secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Borrowers and guarantors, including certain intellectual property rights, bank accounts, any and all insurance receivables, intercompany receivables and/or trade receivables and certain quotas and/or participation rights. 
The Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings, including a covenant against the occurrence of a “change in control” (subject to the Borrowers’ right to prepay the Term Loan), financial reporting obligations and certain limitations on indebtedness, liens (including on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), collateral, transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes and deposit accounts. 
The Credit Agreement contains a minimum cash covenant that requires the initial Borrowers and the guarantors thereunder to maintain a minimum cash balance of $10.0 million until the earlier of (a) a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Credit Agreement), (b) an Ultimate Parent Spinout (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (c) the date that XYQ Luxco, in its capacity as a purchaser under the RIPSA, has received cumulative payments from DSG under the RIPSA in an aggregate amount equal to its pro rata portion of the funding amount thereunder. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) including, but not limited to, the failure to make payments of interest, premium, fees, indemnity or principal under the Term Loan, the failure to comply with certain covenants and agreements specified in the Credit Agreement, defaults in respect of certain other indebtedness and certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency. If any event of default occurs, the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the Term Loan may become due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 2% per year may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and the lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations under the Credit Agreement would automatically become due and payable. 
On the closing date of the Term Loan and in accordance with the Credit Agreement, DSL issued to XYQ Luxco a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 1,199,072 common shares of DSL. The warrant is exercisable at any time until the earlier of (x) seven years from the date of issuance and (y) three years from the closing of an underwritten initial public offering of DSL’s common shares pursuant to an effective registration statement. The warrant includes customary registration rights and customary anti-dilution provisions for the common shares underlying the warrant in respect of certain corporate events (including share splits, share combinations, share dividends and other recapitalization transactions).

License Agreement with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. 
In December 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, Roivant Sciences GmbH (“RSG”), entered into a license agreement with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. (“HanAll”) (the “HanAll Agreement”). Under the HanAll Agreement, RSG received (i) the non-exclusive right to manufacture and (ii) the exclusive, royalty-bearing right to develop, import and use the antibody referred to as IMVT-1401 and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, and to commercialize such products, in the United States, 

49 


Canada, Mexico, the E.U., the U.K., Switzerland, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America (the “HanAll Licensed Territory”), for all human and animal uses. RSG also received the right to grant a sublicense, with prior written notice to HanAll of such sublicense, to: (i) a third-party in any country in the HanAll Licensed Territory outside of the United States and E.U.; (ii) an affiliate of RSG in any country in the HanAll Licensed Territory; and (iii) a third-party in the United States and E.U. only after submission of a biologics license application in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in the E.U. Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG granted to HanAll an exclusive, royalty-free license under certain RSG patents, know-how and other intellectual property relating to such antibodies and products to develop, manufacture and commercialize such antibodies and products for use outside of the HanAll Licensed Territory. 
In December 2018, Immunovant Sciences GmbH, (“ISG”) obtained and assumed all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG, including all rights to IMVT-1401 in the HanAll Licensed Territory, for an aggregate purchase price of $37.8 million. HanAll and RSG have agreed that neither they nor certain of their affiliates will clinically develop or commercialize certain competitive products in the HanAll Licensed Territory. 
Under the HanAll Agreement, the parties may choose to collaborate on a research program directed to the research and development of next generation FcRn inhibitors in accordance with an agreed plan and budget. ISG is obligated to reimburse HanAll for half of such research and development expenses incurred by HanAll, up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0 million. 
Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG made an upfront payment of $30.0 million to HanAll in December 2017. In May 2019, ISG achieved its first development and regulatory milestone, which resulted in a $10.0 million milestone payment that ISG subsequently paid to HanAll in August 2019. ISG will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to a maximum of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. ISG is also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement. These royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the latest of (i) the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents that cover such licensed product in such country expires, (ii) the date on which the data or market exclusivity for such licensed product in such country expires or (iii) 11 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The HanAll Agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis on the expiration of the last royalty term with respect to a given licensed product, unless earlier terminated. ISG may terminate the HanAll Agreement in its entirety without cause upon 180 days’ written notice following 30 days of discussion. Either party may terminate the HanAll Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice for uncured material breach (or 30 days in the case of non-payment), or immediately upon written notice if the other party files a voluntary petition, is subject to a substantiated involuntary petition or for certain other solvency events. HanAll may terminate the HanAll Agreement if ISG or its affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents.

   Michigan License Agreement 
 In November 2020, Oncopia entered into an amended and restated patent license agreement with the University of Michigan (the “Michigan License Agreement”), pursuant to which the University of Michigan granted Oncopia an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patents related to certain existing small molecule protein degraders and certain future small molecule protein degraders that may be developed under the Michigan Research Agreement to make, use and commercialize certain products covered by such patents. Such license grant is subject to, among other things, certain rights required to be granted under prior research or sponsorship agreements. 
 Under the Michigan License Agreement, Oncopia is obligated to pay the University of Michigan a low-to-mid single-digit royalty on net sales of each licensed product. Oncopia’s royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis and end upon the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents under the University of Michigan Agreement which covers such licensed product in such country. The patents and pending patent applications, if granted, currently licensed under the Michigan License Agreement are expected to expire as early as 2037, and as late as 2042, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Oncopia is obligated to pay the University of Michigan minimum annual royalties in the low five-digit range from March 2021 until the first commercial sale of a licensed product, at which time such minimum annual royalties will increase to a low six-digit amount. Oncopia may also be obligated to pay up to a maximum of a high seven-digit amount in development and commercial milestone payments on a per product basis. Unless earlier terminated based on customary termination rights, the term of the Michigan License Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents. 
 Genevant 
 Cross-License Agreement with Arbutus Biopharma Corporation 
 In April 2018, our subsidiary, Genevant Sciences Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “Genevant”), entered into a cross-license agreement with our affiliate, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (“Arbutus”), which the parties amended twice in June 2018 (as amended, the “Arbutus Cross-License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement Arbutus granted Genevant an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable and perpetual license under certain patents and know-how relating to Arbutus’s lipid nanoparticle and GaINAc technology for RNA-based applications other than hepatitis B virus (“HBV”), and certain other excluded fields. The license is subject to certain rights which have previously been licensed by Arbutus to other third parties. Under the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement, Genevant granted back to Arbutus an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free license under the intellectual property licensed under the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement and certain intellectual property acquired by Genevant after the effective date of the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement for applications involving the treatment and prevention of HBV. 
 Genevant is obligated to pay Arbutus tiered low single-digit percentage royalties on sales of products covered by the licensed patents. If Genevant sublicenses intellectual property licensed from Arbutus or collaborates with any third-party to develop, manufacture or commercialize any products covered by the intellectual property licensed by Arbutus, it will be required to pay Arbutus the lesser of (i) up to 20% of the Royalty-Related Receipts (as defined in the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement) received by Genevant from such sublicensees or collaborators and (ii) tiered low single-digit royalties on net sales by sublicensees. Genevant’s royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis and end on the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents in such country that covers such licensed product expires. The patents and pending patent applications, if granted, currently licensed under the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement are expected to expire as early as 2023, and as late as 2039, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Unless earlier terminated based on customary termination rights, the Arbutus Cross-License Agreement will continue until the expiration of Genevant’s royalty obligations. 
 
51 

  In December 2021, Arbutus and Genevant Sciences GmbH, as an assignee of Genevant, entered into the third amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Arbutus Cross License Agreement, which, among other things, clarified the treatment of proceeds received by Genevant from an action for infringement by any third parties of Arbutus’s intellectual property licensed to Genevant. In such an infringement action, Arbutus would be entitled to receive, after deduction of litigation costs, 20% of the proceeds received by Genevant or, if less, tiered low single-digit royalties on net sales of the infringing product (inclusive of the proceeds from litigation or settlement, which would be treated as net sales). The Amendment also clarified that, if a third-party sublicensee of intellectual property licensed by Genevant from Arbutus commercializes a sublicensed product, Arbutus becomes entitled to receive a specified percentage of certain revenue that may be received by Genevant for such sublicense, including royalties, commercial milestones and other sales related revenue, or, if less, tiered low single-digit royalties on net sales of the sublicensed product. The specified percentage is 20% in the case of a mere sublicense (i.e., naked sublicense) by Genevant without additional contribution and 14% in the case of a bona fide collaboration with Genevant. 
 Hemavant 
 License Agreement with Eisai Co. Ltd.

Pfizer is obligated to pay Priovant a tiered high single-digit to sub-teens royalty, on aggregate net sales of its licensed products outside of Priovant’s territory. Each of Priovant’s and Pfizer’s royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the expiration of a customary royalty term, which is the latest of (a) a certain amount of years following the first commercial sale of the applicable products in the applicable country, (b) the date on which the regulatory exclusivity provided by the applicable government authority for the applicable products in that country expires and (c) the date upon which the use, sale, offer for sale or importation of such product in such country would no longer be covered by a valid claim of a licensed product right. Either party may terminate for the other party’s uncured breach and Priovant has the right to terminate for convenience. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for current and future products and product candidates, technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 The patent positions of companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the fields of genetic therapy, cell therapy, biologics or pharmaceutical products generally has emerged in the United States or in Europe, among other countries. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. We cannot be sure that any patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and technology. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our product candidates or technology. The area of patents and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, which may prevent us from commercializing our current and future products and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. 
 Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or technologies 
 
53 

  or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our current and future products and product candidates and technologies. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete protection or competitive advantages against competitors or other third parties with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that achieve similar outcomes but with different approaches. For these reasons, we may have competition for our product candidates. Moreover, the time required for development, testing and regulatory review of our product candidates may shorten the length of effective patent protection following commercialization. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Roivant’s Business and Industry—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

 In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, product candidates and research programs, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third-party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or other third parties. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.

Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, manufacture, testing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, as well as diagnostics, and any future product candidates. Generally, before a new drug, biologic or diagnostic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved, authorized, or cleared by the applicable regulatory authority.

  U.S. Government Regulation of Drug and Biological Products 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations, such as those related to competition. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative actions or judicial sanctions. These actions and sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, debarment from producing or marketing drug products or biologics, disqualification from conducting research, and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, the market acceptance of our products and our reputation. 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either an NDA or a BLA (as defined below) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each human trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations and requirements, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+----------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA inspection of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA and/or us as the sponsor;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required REMS; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the regulatory scheme for drugs and biologics is evolving and subject to change at any time. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 
 
57 

  Preclinical Studies 
 Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. In the U.S., the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for nonclinical (e.g., safety/toxicology) studies. 
 In the U.S., an IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive AEs and carcinogenicity, may continue, and additional preclinical testing may commence, after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Additionally, the review of information in an IND submission may prompt FDA to, among other things, scrutinize existing INDs or marketed products and could generate requests for information or clinical holds on other product candidates or programs. 
 Clinical Trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. In the U.S., each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap or be combined. 
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



58 

  
• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In March 2022, the FDA finalized a guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” the draft of which was released in August 2018. This final guidance outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development, i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial, to compress early phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA or post-approval. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators 15 days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. 
 
59 

  FDA Review Process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. During the COVID-19 pandemic, because of travel and other restrictions, the FDA has significantly curtailed its inspection program. The reduction in pre-approval inspections has resulted in delays to some product approvals. Even with the increase in FDA inspections, there may be delays to product approvals in the future based on a resurgence of problems with respect to the FDA’s ability to conduct inspections and then, even after a complete resumption of the FDA’s normal inspection program, a possible backlog in applications under review by the agency. 
 The FDA has developed the Oncology Center of Excellence RTOR pilot program to facilitate a more efficient review process for certain oncology product candidates. Although this program allows FDA to begin reviewing clinical data prior to submission of a complete NDA or BLA, the program is not intended to change the PDUFA review timelines. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, 
 
60 

  which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require the applicant to obtain additional clinical data, including the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or to complete other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers 
 Under the FDCA, as amended, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biologics that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for 
 
61 

  a subsequent human drug or biologic application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher (a “PRV”). A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA or BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA or BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 A sponsor may seek to develop and obtain approval of its product candidates under programs designed to accelerate the development, FDA review and approval of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. For example, the FDA has a fast-track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA or BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
A product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast-track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development or review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Priority review means that, for an NDA for a new molecular entity or original BLA, the FDA sets a target date for FDA action on the marketing application at six months after accepting the application for filing as opposed to ten months. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. If criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA for a new molecular entity or original BLA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, generally provides a meaningful advantage over other available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease or condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening 
 
62 

  condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast-track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA or BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. 
 The FDA has also announced the availability of the RTOR pilot program for oncology product candidates that are likely to demonstrate substantial improvements over available therapy, which may include drugs previously granted breakthrough therapy designation for the same or other indications and candidates meeting other criteria for other expedited programs, such as fast track and priority review. Submissions for RTOR consideration should also have straightforward study designs and endpoints that can be easily interpreted (such as overall survival or progression free survival). Acceptance into the RTOR pilot does not guarantee or influence approvability of the application, which is subject to the usual benefit-risk evaluation by FDA reviewers, but the program allows FDA to review data earlier, before an applicant formally submits a complete application. The RTOR pilot program does not affect FDA’s PDUFA timelines. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval. 
 Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (the “FDASIA”), amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”), within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
 
63 

  A drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences and certain problems in the manufacturing process, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and any promotion that is false or misleading, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or in a false or misleading manner may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval of the product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the drug or biologic reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug or biologic distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or biologic, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to 
 
64 

  comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug or biologic, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of drug or biologic approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drug or biologic seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of drugs; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | debarment from producing or marketing drug products or biologics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 Success of certain product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic. A companion diagnostic is a medical device, often an in vitro device, which provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. Companion diagnostics can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are generally regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance through the premarket notification process (“510(k) clearance”) or premarket approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or other predicate devices, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device or predicate devices and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device or predicate devices with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device or predicate devices, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. 
 PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA, typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, corrective and 
 
65 

  preventative action, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA application is generally required by statute to take six months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of FDA’s quality system regulation, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug and biologic makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA is able to conduct an inspection of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities. 
 FDA has taken the position that developers of companion diagnostic tests associated with novel therapeutic products should seek clearance or approval at the same time that the therapeutic developer seeks approval. FDA has recognized that contemporaneous clearance or approval of a companion diagnostic with a therapeutic is not always possible, though FDA has indicated that coordination of contemporaneous clearances/approvals is a policy goal. In October 2018, FDA issued a safety alert warning against the use of unapproved or uncleared genetic tests to predict patient response to specific medications. While FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion against laboratory developed tests—tests which are developed and performed in a single Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) certified laboratory—the 2018 alert and a subsequent 2019 Warning Letter against Inova Genomics Laboratory suggest that FDA may prioritize for enforcement certain uncleared or unapproved tests marketed as companion diagnostic tests. Subsequently, FDA has attempted to encourage collaboration between in vitro diagnostic test developers and therapeutic developers and to clarify FDA expectations as to companion diagnostic labeling, particularly through guidance in the oncology area. In June 2021, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2021 (the “VALID Act”) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. Similar to the 2020 iteration of the bill, among other things, the VALID Act would likely classify all companion diagnostic tests as requiring FDA premarket review and would formalize and arguably expand FDA’s regulatory authority over diagnostic testing. Though passage of the VALID Act is uncertain, strong bipartisan support remains for some kind of diagnostic testing legislative reform in the near term. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 Certain of our product candidates, including IMVT-1401, are regulated as biologics. An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the “BPCI Act”), as part of the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”). This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, 
 
66 

  as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 A reference biological product is granted four and twelve year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. The FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and the FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”), the Office of Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights, other divisions of the Department of HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in making clinically-appropriate decisions enabling patient access to any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers and physicians and any future arrangements with third-party payers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and HIPAA. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 Drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs 
 
67 

  (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim; the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, which would preclude reimbursement of our products under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing certain billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to federal, state, and commercial reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
 HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 We are subject to data privacy and security regulations administered and enforced by the federal government as well as statutes and regulations adopted in the states in which we conduct our business. At the federal level, the FDA regulations for the protection of human research subjects require that we protect the privacy of personal information and obtain appropriate informed consent in connection with research using identifiable subject information or identifiable biological samples. In addition, the data privacy and security regulations implementing HIPAA impose strict limitations on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including for research purposes. Civil and criminal penalties may be imposed on entities subject to HIPAA, both by the HHS Office for Civil Rights and by state attorneys general, who have the authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and to seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing such actions. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has broad authority to investigate and initiate enforcement actions regarding any activity affecting the privacy or security of personal information that it deems deceptive or unfair. At the state level, a rapidly growing body of privacy and data protection laws impose requirements and restrictions, some of which are more stringent than federal law and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, 
 
68 

  and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. 
 Similar federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. 
 Current and Future Legislation 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. 
 
69 

  For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the changes made by the ACA to preexisting law of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA: 
 

• | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% (increased pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Most recently, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in June 2021; however, future legal disputes remain possible. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA, and the law may be subjected to various Executive Orders and/or regulatory action to expand or reduce the scope of the law, based on the administration controlling the White House. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, and the law may continue to exert significant pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and our profitability. 
 Moreover, in May 2018, the Trump administration released its “Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs,” or the Blueprint, and former President Trump also issued a number of Executive Orders in 2020 that were aimed at lowering the prices of prescription drugs. Some rules enacted under the Trump Administration have been stayed as a result of pending litigation or are under review or have been rescinded by the Biden Administration and/or Congress. For example, a rule enacted under the Trump Administration known as the “Most Favored Nations” rule would set Medicare Part B reimbursement at an amount no higher than the lowest price that a drug manufacturer receives on a particular product in an index of foreign countries. This rule currently was the subject of litigation, and was formally rescinded the Biden Administration in August 2021. Other initiatives under the Trump administration have taken effect. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a form of drug utilization management, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. 
 
70 

  Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the CARES Act and subsequent legislation, these reductions were suspended starting on May 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently enacted legislation extended the suspension through March 2022, with a 1% cut through the end of June 2022, after which the cuts would return to 2%unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 eliminates the Medicaid unit rebate cap effective as of January 1, 2024, and the removal of this rebate cap could significantly impact our Medicaid rebate liability beginning in 2024. 
 There also have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, require drug pricing negotiations in Medicare, redesign the Part D benefit to lower patient costs and overall spending, introduce enhanced transparency measures into drug pricing, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, for example, by introducing inflationary penalties for Parts B and D drugs. The Biden Administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority. In July 2021, President Biden issued an executive order pertaining to drug pricing, which expressed support for legislation allowing direct negotiation in Medicare Part D and inflationary rebates, and directed various executive branch agencies to take actions to lower drug prices and promote generic competition. Additionally, on November 19, 2021, the House passed the Build Back Better Act, which among other provisions, would permit the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain high-expenditure Part D drugs, impose inflationary rebates for Part D drugs, and redesign the Part D benefit. The Senate Finance Committee introduced a modified version of the legislation on December 11, 2021, but negotiations have since stalled. Although the House and Senate versions of this legislation would grant certain exceptions for “small biotech drugs” and “specified small manufacturers,” if passed, we cannot predict how these exceptions would be implemented and their impact on Roivant. Ultimately, we cannot predict whether these or other drug pricing initiatives will be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates. 
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biotherapeutic product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative. In particular, the obligation to provide notices of price increases to purchasers under laws such as California’s SB-17 may influence customer ordering patterns for our products, which in turn may increase the volatility of our revenues as a reflection of changes in inventory volumes. 
 Packaging and Distribution in the United States 
 If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 
71 

  The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations 
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for 
 
72 

  restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 European Union and United Kingdom Drug Development 
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable in the United Kingdom. However this ended on December 31, 2020. On December 30, 2020, the United Kingdom and European Union signed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which includes an agreement on free trade between the two parties. Since the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom covering the quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorizations, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom, as the UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for medicinal products and devices in the United Kingdom in the long term. The MHRA has published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the United Kingdom’s regulatory position on medicinal products and medical devices evolves over time. There are also a number of ongoing consultations on the future legislation in the UK. 
 In the EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and United Kingdom, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the relevant competent authority has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EEA and United Kingdom are subject to significant regulatory controls. The EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Directive”) sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently into their national laws, including in the UK. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under this regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be 
 
73 

  approved in each of the EU/UK countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (the “NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under this regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the country where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation is undergoing a transition process due to the application of a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Regulation”), which is mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted the Regulation, which started to apply on January 31, 2022 and replaced the current Directive. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States without the need for EU Member States to transpose it into national law, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
 Following Brexit, this Regulation is not applicable in the UK, and the national legislation put in place to implement the Directive continues to apply to trials conducted in the UK. 
 European Union and United Kingdom Drug Marketing 
 Much like the federal Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians and/or healthcare organizations to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, administration or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EEA and United Kingdom. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the Directive governing medicinal products for human use, as implemented in the relevant Member State and the UK, the national anti-bribery laws of the European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK, as well as the industry Codes of Practice that are based on the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Code of Practice, collectively govern the provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the national laws of the EU Member States, as well as in the UK Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU. 
 Depending on the applicable national rules in the EU Member States and the UK, payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, physician associations, medical students, healthcare organizations, patient organizations and other stakeholders in the EU Member States, the UK and Member States of the EEA must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual country. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the relevant country. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
 European Union and United Kingdom Drug Review and Approval 
 In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). There are two main types of marketing authorizations for innovative medicinal products, which, however, are based on largely identical regulatory rules, requirements and timelines, including the requirements concerning the presentation and content of the application for marketing authorization. 

• | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), of the EMA,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



74 

  
and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EEA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. If a product is to be authorized in more than one Member State, the assessment procedure is coordinated between the relevant EU Member States. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, the national MA can be recognized in another Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (the “RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS coordinates the preparation of a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (the “SmPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their final approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging circulated by the RMS, the coordinated procedures is closed, and the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the above-described procedures, during the assessment of the documents submitted in the MAA and before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol of the Withdrawal Agreement, centralized MAs will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a valid centralized MA as of December 31, 2020 were automatically converted to MAs valid in Great Britain on January, 1 2021 (unless the MA holder opted out of this procedure). For a period of two years from January 1, 2021 (although this may be extended), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new MA valid in Great Britain. A separate application will, however, still be required and the MHRA has the right to undertake its own assessment of the dossier. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to MAs approved in EEA Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a MA in the United Kingdom or Great Britain. 
 European Union and United Kingdom Data Protection and Market Exclusivity 
 In the EEA and UK, innovative medicinal products, approved on the basis of a full dossier of preclinical and clinical data as part of the MAA, qualify for eight years of data protection upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data protection, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference innovative product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EEA/UK, for a period of eight 
 
75 

  years from the date of authorization of the reference product. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data protection, however, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a MA based on a marketing authorization application with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials (i.e. without cross-referencing to the data within the reference innovative product). 
 European Union and United Kingdom Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 In the EEA, the European Commission, based on the scientific assessment from the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and either (i) such condition affects not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EEA, or (ii) it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In either case, the applicant must also demonstrate that no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected compared to the product available). 
 In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to benefits such as scientific advice (protocol assistance) and financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. In addition, if the criteria for orphan designation are found to be maintained at the time of authorization of the product, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following grant of an orphan marketing authorization. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission nor any of the competent authorities in the EEA Members States can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product” for the same indication. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This orphan exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be broken, so a similar product may be authorized for the same indication, in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder consents to the grant of the similar product; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The upcoming legislative reforms in the EU, which are part of the new EU Pharmaceutical Strategy and some of which could materialize in 2022, may result in a reduction of market exclusivity periods for orphan medicinal products, and or imposition of additional requirements for grant of such exclusivity. In addition, the strategy envisages changes to the concept of unmet medical need and considers introducing novel rewards for medicines addressing an unmet medical need. 
 From January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan drug designation has applied in Great Britain. There is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation step required (as there is in the EEA), and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of the marketing authorization application. The criteria are the same as in the EEA, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain). Orphan exclusivity granted to a centralized marketing authorization will also apply in Northern Ireland.

  European Union and United Kingdom Pediatric Investigation Plan 
 In the EEA and UK, MAAs for new medicinal products have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (a “PIP”), agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (a “PDCO”) or MHRA as relevant. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO/MHRA can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO/MHRA when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. If a marketing authorization is obtained and trial results are included in the product information, even when negative, and the product is approved in all Member States, non-orphan products are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 
 As noted above, the upcoming legislative reforms in the EU, which are part of the new EU Pharmaceutical Strategy may result in a reduction of the above pediatric rewards and/or imposition of additional requirements for grant of rewards. 
 European Union and United Kingdom data protection regime 
 The processing of personal data, including health data, in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the European Union or EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union or EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including inter alia stringent requirements relating to lawful and legitimate basis and purposes for the processing of personal data, the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, appointment of a data protection officers, conclusion of data processing agreements, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Until recently, one such data transfer mechanism was the EU-US Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated for international transfers of personal data in July 2020 by the CJEU. The CJEU upheld the validity of standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) as a legal mechanism to transfer personal data but companies relying on SCCs will, subject to additional guidance from regulators in the EEA and the U.K., need to evaluate and implement supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs. It remains to be seen whether SCCs will remain available and whether additional means for lawful data transfers will become available. Moreover, the competent authorities and courts in a number of EU Member States increasingly scrutinize and question the GDPR compliance of processing of personal data by US-based entities or entities with links to US-based entities, independently of whether personal data is actually transferred outside the EEA. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. In June 2021, the CJEU issued a ruling that expanded the scope of the “one stop shop” under the GDPR. According to the ruling, the competent authorities of EU Member States may, under certain strict conditions, bring claims to their national courts against a company for breaches of the GDPR, including unlawful cross-border processing activities, even 
 
77 

  such company does not have an establishment in the EU member state in question and the competent authority bringing the claim is not the lead supervisory authority. 
 In addition, further to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. With respect to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom, on June 28, 2021 the European Commission issued an adequacy decision in respect of the UK’s data protection framework, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK to continue without requiring organizations to put in place contractual or other measures in order to lawfully transfer personal data between the territories. While it is intended to last for at least four years, the European Commission may unilaterally revoke the adequacy decision at any point, and if this occurs it could lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and 
 Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations 
 If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Further, other anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act, are broader and can regulate payments to non-governmental entities.
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence 
 
78 

  outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. 
 The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are covered or paid for by the federal or national government as well as commercial managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and similar healthcare management organizations. 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment, and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. Such efforts include the use of accumulator adjustment programs that do not consider amounts paid by pharmaceutical copay assistance programs as counting towards a patient’s deductible or other out-of-pocket costs. Under new rules promulgated by CMS that will take effect January 1, 2023, such accumulator adjustment (or similar) programs could affect the amount of rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or affect our ability to offer various forms of patient support, including copay assistance. This regulation is subject to ongoing litigation; however, we cannot predict if the rule ultimately will be overturned or rescinded. At the same time, however, certain states have passed laws prohibiting third-party payors from utilizing accumulator programs. 
 Government authorities and third-party payors also have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the acquisition costs and reimbursement for drug products may lower than within the United States. 
 In the United States, the decisions about reimbursement for new drug products under the Medicare program are made by CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS determines coverage standards for products reimbursed by Medicare, and private payors often adopt coverage standards established by CMS for the commercial marketplace. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. 
 
79 

  Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or are expected to lose employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs, a manufacturer must enter into agreements with the Secretary of HHS to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B drug discount program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are obligated to pay rebates to the State Medicaid Programs on each unit of the manufacturer’s drugs that are reimbursed by State Medicaid Programs—both with regard to Medicaid Fee for Service and Medicaid Managed Care. Additionally, under the 340B drug discount program, manufacturers extend discounts to “covered entities” eligible to participate in the 340B program, including various hospital providers. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and Medicaid rebate amounts reported and paid by the manufacturer under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under current law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on drugs that receive an orphan designation by the FDA. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions to the statute and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program may cause the required 340B discount to increase. Additional legislation surrounding the 340B program, including which providers are eligible for the program, may be enacted in the future. These developments could affect our profitability. 
 Moreover, there also is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of cell or genetic therapy products. Although a new rule finalized by CMS for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program increased flexibility regarding the manner in which manufacturers may offer value-based discounting arrangements, and following a regulatory delay, is expected to take effect on July 1, 2022. 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis. 
 
80 

  These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. 
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union and UK, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes or the amount of profit made on those profits, and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of March 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 863 full-time employees, including 791 in the United States. 
 Our human capital objectives include sourcing, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and developing our existing and future employees. We seek to create nimble, entrepreneurial Vants that operate similarly to independent biotechnology companies where each management team, comprised of world-class drug developers and clinical operators, is solely focused on their respective Vant’s mission. Our and our Vants’ equity incentive plans are designed to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of share-based compensation awards to encourage focus and calculated risk-taking. In connection with becoming a public company, we expect to continue to hire additional personnel and to implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements and customary practices.
