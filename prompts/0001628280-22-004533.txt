Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a global leader in the design, manufacturing and servicing of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. We provide this technology to data centers, communication networks and commercial & industrial environments worldwide.
We believe there is a better way to meet the world's accelerating demand for data - one driven by passion and innovation.
Our Company
Vertiv Holdings Co, formerly known as GS Acquisition Holdings Corp, was originally incorporated in Delaware on April 25, 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company. On June 12, 2018, GS Acquisition Holdings Corp (“GSAH”) consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”), following which its securities began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). Thereafter, on February 7, 2020, (1) Crew Merger Sub I LLC, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of GSAH merged with and into Vertiv Holdings, LLC (“Vertiv Holdings”) with Vertiv Holdings continuing as the surviving entity, and (2) immediately thereafter, Vertiv Holdings merged with and into Crew Merger Sub II LLC, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of GSAH, with Crew Merger Sub II LLC continuing as the surviving entity and being renamed “Vertiv Holdings, LLC”. This transaction is referred to as the “Business Combination”.
As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, (a) the Company directly owns all of the equity interests of Vertiv Holdings and indirectly owns the equity interests of its subsidiaries and (b) VPE Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Vertiv Stockholder"), the sole equity owner of Vertiv Holdings prior to the Business Combination, holds 37,955,215 shares of our Class A common stock as of February 22, 2022.
Our Business
We have a suite of comprehensive offerings, innovative solutions and a leading service organization that supports a diversified group of customers, which we deliver from engineering, manufacturing, sales and service locations in more than 45 countries across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). We provide the hardware, software and services to facilitate an increasingly interconnected marketplace of digital systems where large amounts of indispensable data need to be transmitted, analyzed, processed and stored. Whether this growing quantity of data is managed centrally in hyperscale/cloud locations, distributed at the so-called “edge” of the network, processed in an enterprise location or managed via a hybrid platform, the underpinnings and operations of all those locations rely on our critical digital infrastructure and services. 
We have a broad range of offerings, which include AC and DC power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure. These comprehensive offerings are integral to the technologies used for a number of services, including e-commerce, online banking, file sharing, video on-demand, energy storage, wireless communications, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and online gaming. In addition, through our global services network, we provide lifecycle management services, predictive analytics and professional services for deploying, maintaining and optimizing these products and their related systems.
Our primary customers are businesses across three main end markets: (1) data centers (including hyperscale/cloud, colocation, enterprise and edge), (2) communication networks and (3) commercial and industrial environments. Within these areas we serve a diverse array of industries, including social media, financial services, healthcare, transportation, retail, education and government. We approach these industries and end users through our global network of direct sales professionals, independent sales representatives, channel partners and original equipment manufacturers. Many of our installations are completed in collaboration with our customers and we work with them from the initial planning phase through delivery and servicing of the completed solution. This depth of interaction supports key customer relationships, sometimes spanning multiple decades. Our most prominent brands include Liebert, NetSure, Geist, E&I, Powerbar and Avocent.
Our business is organized into three segments according to our main geographic regions—the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA—and we manage and report our results of operations across these three business segments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Vertiv’s revenue was $4,998.1, of which 44% was transacted in the Americas; 32% was transacted in Asia Pacific; and 24% was transacted in EMEA as compared with our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $4,370.6, of which 47% was transacted in the Americas, 31% was transacted in Asia Pacific, and 22% in EMEA.
Our Customers
Our primary customers are businesses across three main end markets: (1) data centers (including hyperscale/cloud, colocation, enterprise and edge), (2) communication networks and (3) commercial and industrial environments.
Data Centers: The primary purpose of a data center is to process, store and distribute data. There are a host of different sizes and types of data centers, but primarily they can be broken down into the following classifications:
•Cloud/Hyperscale: These facilities are massive in scale and are primarily used to support off-premise cloud applications. This portion of the industry is growing rapidly. Examples of companies in this space include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud.
•Colocation: These facilities range in size and offer users a location where they can place their information technology (“I.T.”) equipment, while the building and critical digital infrastructure is owned by the colocation company. We find that this portion of the industry is growing rapidly. Examples of companies in this space include Digital Realty and Equinix.
•Enterprise: This classification refers to the “Fortune 1000” type businesses that have their own on-premises data centers. Examples of companies in this space include Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Walmart and Cleveland Clinic. We have found that the growth of the enterprise market, based on data centers and square footage, has generally been flat for the past three years.
•Edge: These types of data centers are at the infancy stage of their development and will likely be utilized by all of the aforementioned categories in the future. These locations are decentralized by nature and located closer to where the data is being demanded (i.e., towards the edge of the network). This market is currently small, but the opportunities for growth in this space are expected to increase as the proliferation of connected devices and data storage needs continue to grow in the future.
Communication Networks: This space is comprised of wireline, wireless and broadband companies. These companies create content and are ultimately responsible for distributing voice, video and data to businesses and consumers. They deliver this data through an intricate network of wireline and wireless mediums. Additionally, some of these companies’ locations act as data centers where the data is delivered, processed and stored. This sector has a generally low single-digit growth profile.
Commercial/Industrial: This space is comprised of those applications that are tied to a company’s critical systems. Examples include transportation, manufacturing, oil and gas, etc. These applications are growing in their need for intelligent infrastructure and may be regulated or need to satisfy some level of compliance. The growth in this area generally aligns with gross domestic product.
Our Offerings
We design, manufacture and service critical digital infrastructure technology for data centers, communication networks and commercial/industrial environments. Our principal offerings include:
Critical infrastructure & solutions
We identify delivery of products as performance obligations within the critical infrastructure & solutions offering. Such products include AC and DC power management, thermal management, low/medium voltage switchgear, busway, and integrated modular solutions.
Integrated Rack Solutions
Performance obligations within integrated rack solutions include the delivery of racks, rack power, rack power distribution, rack thermal systems, configurable integrated solutions, and hardware for managing I.T. equipment.
Services & spares
Services include preventative maintenance, acceptance testing, engineering and consulting, performance assessments, remote monitoring, training, spare parts, and critical digital infrastructure software.
Sales and Marketing
Due to the global nature of our customers, we go to market through multiple channels to ensure that we map our coverage to align with our customers’ buying organization. Our primary selling method is direct sales. To accomplish this, we have approximately 3,000 sales people located around the world. Additionally, we utilize a robust network of channel partners in the form of distributors, I.T. resellers, value-added retailers and original equipment manufacturers. This network helps extend our global reach to all corners of the world where we operate.
Backlog
Vertiv’s estimated combined order backlog was approximately $3,191.0 and $1,844.8 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The backlog consists of product and service orders for which a customer purchase order or purchase commitment has been received and which have not yet been delivered. Orders may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. The following table shows estimated backlog by business segment at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(Dollars in millions) | December 31, 2021(1) | | December 31, 2020
Americas | $ | 1,886.1 | | | $ | 836.0 
Asia Pacific | 484.2 | | | 445.9 | 
EMEA | 820.7 | | | 562.9 | 
Total Backlog | $ | 3,191.0 | | | $ | 1,844.8

(1)    For the year ended December 31, 2021 E&I backlog of $66.0 and $221.8 are included in Americas; and Europe, Middle East & Africa reportable segments, respectively. 
The vast majority of the combined backlog as of December 31, 2021 is considered firm and is expected to be shipped within one year. Due to continued supply chain challenges globally and continued strong demand there has been an increase in customer orders placed in advance which has increased backlog by approximately $1.4 billion since 2020. We do not believe that Vertiv’s backlog estimates as of any date are necessarily indicative of our revenues for any future period. Backlog estimates are subject to a number of risks. See “Item 1A. Risk factors—Risks relating to our customers and our industry—We may not realize all of the sales expected from our backlog of orders and contracts.”
Research and Development
We are committed to outpacing our competitors and being first to market with new product developments and improvements. In 2021, Vertiv spent $266.4 on Research and Development (“R&D”). We use our R&D budget to focus on fostering new product innovation and engineering. We have global product leaders that manage global product lines and engineering organizations to ensure that we continue to be ahead of market trends by leveraging our regional input. These global groups are also supported by in-region product and engineering teams who are responsible for understanding and adapting our offerings to local market and customer requirements. These teams work closely with our sales and service network which allows us to receive and act upon customer feedback to continuously improve our offerings.
Competition
We encounter competition from a variety of areas; however the majority of our competitors are targeted within a specific offering or a specific geographic location. Competition in our markets is primarily on the basis of reliability, quality, price, service and customer relationships. Across our three markets, we encounter two principal types of competitors: niche players and global competitors. We believe we differentiate ourselves through our ability to service customers in each phase of the product lifecycle, our large customer network which allows us to address the local and regional needs of our customer base, our ability to apply our understanding of trends, technologies and the implementation of our offerings to our customers’ utilization of technology and our integration with third party software which allows us to customize solutions according to a particular customer’s needs.
Facilities, Operations and Supply Chain
Being able to serve our customers both on a global and regional level is important, and we have built our manufacturing footprint with that principle in mind. We have significant manufacturing facilities in the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA. This well-diversified global network of facilities allows for cost, delivery and inventory optimization. Our manufacturing facilities are supported by regional engineering and configuration centers where, if our customers desire, we can tailor our products to the local market and to a given customer’s specific requirements.
We have established a robust supply chain that is normally complementary to our manufacturing footprint. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to supply chain constraints, despite strong market demand, and we have experienced significant material, freight and labor cost increases, which are expected to continue throughout 2022. In addition to providing high quality service to our customers, we follow a diversification strategy to avoid overconcentration or a significant dependence on a particular supplier or region. The Company continues to take actions to address these challenges. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 24,000 full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 29% of our employees are manufacturing operators and we use talent acquisition and retention practices, including but not limited to, college and university recruiting programs, job fairs, and compensation benchmarking, employee engagement and communication through email, social media, and other communication platforms. We also provide employee development and training programs for our employees, including new product training for our sales and services organizations, “Managing@Vertiv” for our management level employees, and “MyFirst90Days” for newly hired employees as key human capital measures and objectives.
We are committed to attracting, hiring and developing the best and brightest talent and focus significant resources on supporting and managing our globally diverse employee population. We offer our employees competitive pay packages and a broad range of company-paid benefits and recognize that our success is based in large part on the talents and dedication of those we employ.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to create, obtain and protect intellectual property is important to the success of our business and our ability to compete. We create intellectual property ("IP") in our operations globally, and we actively work to protect and enforce our IP rights. We consider our trademarks to be valuable assets, including well-known marks within the industry such as Vertiv, Geist, Liebert, Energy Labs, NetSure, E&I, Powerbar, and Avocent.
In addition, we integrate licensed third party technology and IP into certain aspects of our products. Although certain third party proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular third party patent of license or group.
As of December 31, 2021 Vertiv had approximately 2,700 patents and approximately 470 pending, published or allowed patent applications, and approximately 1,800 registered trademarks and approximately 200 pending trademark applications.
Raw Materials
We obtain raw materials and supplies from a variety of sources and generally from more than one supplier. We have experienced critical part shortages supply chain constraints in addition to logistical issues which have significantly delayed receipt of materials, as well as increases in the costs of certain raw materials. We continue to address these challenges associated with our sources, supplies and costs of raw materials.
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to a broad range of foreign and domestic environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and requirements, including those relating to the discharge of regulated materials into the environment, the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes, human health and safety and the content, composition and takeback of our products. We maintain an environmental, health and safety compliance program, including policies and standards, dedicated staff, and periodic auditing and training. We also have a program for complying with the European Union Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the European Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals regulation, and similar requirements.
At sites which we own, lease or operate, or have previously owned, leased or operated, or where we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur liability for any potential contamination, and could in the future be liable for additional contamination. We have projects under way at certain current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination. Compliance with laws regulating contamination and the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Business Combination
GSAH was incorporated on April 25, 2016 as a Delaware corporation under the name “GS Acquisition Holdings Corp” and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On June 12, 2018, GSAH closed its IPO of 69,000,000 units, consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, at a price of $10.00 per unit. Each whole warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Public Warrants”). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, GSAH closed the private placement of an aggregate of 10,533,333 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants” and, together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”), initially issued to GS DC Sponsor I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”), at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds of $15.8. 
The Public Warrants were redeemed by the Company and delisted on January 19, 2021. The Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrant. As of December 31, 2021, there are 10,533,333 private placement warrants outstanding.
On the Closing Date, in connection with the Business Combination, we entered into certain related agreements including the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement (each of which is described below under “—Related Agreements.”
Related Agreements
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
On the Closing Date, we entered into the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”), with the Initial Stockholders, the Vertiv Stockholder, the GS ESC PIPE Investor, the Cote PIPE Investor and certain other PIPE Investors (collectively, with each other person who has executed and delivered a joinder thereto, the “RRA Parties”), pursuant to which the RRA Parties are entitled to registration rights in respect of certain shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and certain other equity securities of the Company that are held by the RRA Parties from time to time.
Each of the GS Sponsor Member, the Cote Sponsor Member and the Vertiv Stockholder is entitled to make up to two demand registrations in any 12 month period in connection with an underwritten shelf takedown offering, in each case subject to certain offering thresholds, applicable lock-up restrictions and certain other conditions. In addition, the RRA Parties have certain “piggy-back” registration rights. The Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement includes customary indemnification and confidentiality provisions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any registration statements filed pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement.
On February 7, 2020, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (the “Registration Statement on Form S-1”), to meet its obligations under the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement. In August 2020, the Vertiv Stockholder sold 26,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in a secondary offering and in November 2020, the Vertiv Stockholder sold 18,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock in a secondary offering. 
Stockholders Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Company, the GS Sponsor Member, the Cote Sponsor Member and the Vertiv Stockholder entered into the Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”). 
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Vertiv Stockholder has the right to nominate up to four directors to our Board of Directors, subject to its ownership percentage of the total outstanding shares of Class A common stock. If the Vertiv Stockholder holds: (i) 30% or greater of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate four directors (two of which must be independent); (ii) less than 30% but greater than or equal to 20% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate three directors (one of which must be independent); (iii) less than 20% but greater than or equal to 10% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate two directors; (iv) less than 10% but greater than or equal to 5% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will have the right to nominate one director; and (v) less than 5% of the outstanding Class A common stock, it will not have the right to nominate any directors. As long as the Vertiv Stockholder has the right to nominate at least one director, the Vertiv Stockholder shall have certain rights to appoint its nominees to committees of the Board of Directors and the Company shall take certain actions to ensure the number of directors serving on the Board of Directors does not exceed nine. In addition, the Stockholders Agreement provides that so long as the Company has any Executive Chairman or Chief Executive Officer as a named executive officer, the Company shall take certain actions to include such Executive Chairman or Chief Executive Officer on the slate of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors for election. The Stockholders Agreement also provides that, for so long as the Vertiv Stockholder holds at least 5% of our outstanding Class A common stock, the Vertiv Stockholder will have the right to designate an observer to attend meetings of the Board, subject to certain limitations. As of February 22, 2022, the Vertiv Stockholder holds 10% of the outstanding Class A common stock. 
Tax Receivable Agreement
In connection with the Business Combination, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement, which generally provided for payments to the Vertiv Stockholder of 65% of the cash tax savings in U.S. federal, state, local and certain foreign taxes, that we actually realize (or are deemed to realize) in periods after the closing of the Business Combination as a result of (i) increases in the tax basis of certain intangible assets of Vertiv resulting from certain pre-Business Combination acquisitions, (ii) certain U.S. federal income tax credits for increasing research activities (so-called “R&D credits”) and (iii) tax deductions in respect of certain Business Combination expenses. We expect to retain the benefit of the remaining 35% of these cash tax savings.
For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the applicable tax savings are generally computed by comparing our actual tax liability for a given taxable year to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay in such taxable year without the tax basis in the certain intangible assets, the U.S. federal income tax R&D credits and the tax deductions for certain Business Combination expenses described above. The original term of the Tax Receivable Agreement was twelve taxable years following the closing of the Business Combination, with the payments described in (i) and (ii) above being deferred until the close of our third taxable year following the closing of the Business Combination, and payments described in (iii) above generally being deferred until the close of our fourth taxable year following the closing of the Business Combination and then payable ratably over the following three taxable year period regardless of whether we actually realize such tax benefits.
On December 31, 2021, the Company and the Vertiv Stockholder entered into a TRA Repurchase Agreement, in which the parties agreed to amend and supplement the Tax Receivable Agreement, to replace the Company’s remaining payment obligations under the Tax Receivable agreement with an obligation to pay $100 million in cash in two equal installments, payable on or before June 15, 2022, and on or before September 15, 2022. Upon receipt of the second installment payment, the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and the Company will not be required to make any further payments to the Vertiv Stockholder thereunder. In the event of a change of control of the Company prior to delivery of the second installment payment, all unpaid installment payments (together with any accrued interest thereon) will accelerate and become payable upon the consummation of such change of control, consistent with the existing terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, in the event of a material breach by the Company of any of its material obligations under the TRA Repurchase Agreement, all unpaid obligations under the TRA Repurchase Agreement will accelerate and become payable immediately and will accrue interest at a rate equal to the lesser of the default rate and the maximum rate (each, as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) until satisfied in full.
