Each March 2020 Private Placement Unit was comprised of: (i) US$1,000 principal amount of 9.875% senior secured first-lien notes (the March 2020 Private Placement Notes); and (ii) 113 common share purchase warrants (the March 2020 Private Placement Warrants) of the Company. On April 23, 2020, the Company completed the second and final tranche of the March 2020 Private Placement for additional gross proceeds of US$1,000,000. In total, the gross proceeds under the March 2020 Private Placement totaled US$15,250,000. 
 The March 2020 Private Placement Notes were governed by the terms of a trust indenture dated March 31, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as trustee. The March 2020 Private Placement Warrants are governed by the terms of a warrant indenture (the March 2020 Warrant Indenture) dated March 31, 2020 between the Company and Odyssey Trust Company, as warrant agent. 
 Launch of Virtual.Care Platform 
 In April 2020, the Company announced the launch of Virtual.Care (the Platform), an online educational and informational tool for patients, designated caregivers, and adult use purchasers, in those states where adult use cannabis is legalized. The Platform is accessed via the Companys age-gated website and was initially launched in three states: California, Illinois and Massachusetts and has now expanded to five additional jurisdictions: Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C. 
 Prior to launching the Platform, the Companys compliance team and external counsel undertook a review of the applicable federal and state privacy, advertising and cannabis laws and launched the Platform in a manner to ensure compliance with those laws. The Companys Platform is not intended to be used in advertising activities but is intended to be used solely as a virtual educational tool, allowing users to understand the products that the Company offers. There are no sales of products completed over the Platform. 
 A user may pre-order products but to complete an order, the user must physically visit the applicable Columbia Care dispensary. This requirement ensures compliance since no orders will be completed for residents of jurisdictions where medical and/or recreational cannabis is illegal, as applicable. 
 
15 


 In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the user, the dispensary staff person will verify the users medical marijuana card, government-issued identification and confirm the users allotment to ensure the user is not exceeding the states allotment limits. Once all of the foregoing is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the purchase. The Platform does not allow medical users to obtain online certifications and any such certifications must be obtained through the normal channels. 
 In jurisdictions where recreational use is legal, upon arrival at the Columbia Care dispensary, the dispensary staff will verify that the user is at least 21 years of age by verifying the users government-issued identification. Once the identification is verified, the user will pay for the product to complete the transaction. If the user does not have valid identification, the user will not be able to purchase cannabis at the Companys dispensaries. This process also allows monitoring of sales to non-residents and only allow sales where the state regulatory schemes allow an out-of-state resident to purchase product if he or she is present in the legal jurisdiction. 
 May 2020 Private Placement 
 In May 2020, the Company completed a concurrent brokered and non-brokered private placement (the May 2020 Private Placement) of units (the May 2020 Private Placement Units) for gross proceeds of US$19,115,000.

The Green Leaf Medical Agreement contemplates upfront consideration of approximately US$240,000,000, comprised of US$45,000,000 in cash and US$195,000,000 payable in Common Shares, in addition to potential performance-based milestone payments in 2022 and 2023. 
 
17 


 Prior to entering into the Green Leaf Medical Agreement, Columbia Cares management conducted extensive analysis of the business being acquired. Among other things, the Companys analysis included consideration of Green Leaf Medicals historical financial performance, its competitive strength, expectations for changes to the regulatory environment in which it operates, and the expertise of its management and employees. 
 Furthermore, Columbia Cares Board retained independent experts to provide advice and assistance, including the preparation and delivery to the Board, an opinion as to the fairness of the Green Leaf Medical Agreement, from a financial point of view, to the Company. 
 In Maryland, Green Leaf Medical holds one cultivation license, one processing license, two dispensary licenses (one under a management agreement) with a third dispensary license in pre-approval stages. Green Leaf Medical also holds one dispensary license in Ohio, one grower/processor license in Pennsylvania, and one license in Virginia, which permits Green Leaf Medical to operate one co-located cultivation/dispensary facility and five stand-alone dispensaries in their authorized region. 
 The Green Leaf Transaction closed on June 11, 2021, following receipt of all required regulatory approvals, including, but not limited to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as well as state level approvals.

 Description of the Business 
 Overview of the Company 
 Columbia Care is a U.S.-based, vertically-integrated consumer product, health and wellness cannabis company with cultivation, product development, production, home delivery and dispensary operations. The Company has built one of the broadest and longest operational records of any licensee in publicly administered medicinal and adult-use cannabis programs in the United States. It has developed proprietary branded products with intellectual property comprised of a variety of medical and adult-use form factors, including but not limited to proprietary formulations, precision manufactured dosing and cannabis flower and flower-derived products. The Companys mission is to improve lives through product innovation, research and development and outstanding patient and consumer experience. Columbia Cares vision is to address the worlds health and wellness needs through plant-based medicine. 
 Columbia Care is one of the largest and most experienced cultivators, manufacturers and providers of medical cannabis products and services in the United States. 
 In addition to its U.S. operations, Columbia Care has operations in the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU). In December 2021, Columbia Care launched a range of vaporizer pen products to supplement its proprietary solid-fill cannabis powder capsule (available since April 2021) and medical cannabis tinctures (available in the region since April 2020). For medical cannabis products in the UK, Columbia Care partners with IPS Pharma, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer licensed by the UKs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), who manufactures Columbia Cares proprietary product formulations for the UK market. Columbia Cares proprietary medical cannabis tincture formulations have received certain approvals from the German regulator, BfArM, and were first made available in Germany in 2021. 
 Since 2019, Columbia Cares flagship wellness brand, Columbia Care Platinum, has been available in the United Kingdom. Columbia Care submitted its Novel Foods dossier for these products in 2020 in accordance with the United Kingdoms Food Standards Agencys timeline to validate the dossier to meet the regulatory requirements of the region. Columbia Care launched its eCommerce channel for the United Kingdom in July 2021. 
 Columbia Care is exploring further opportunities in the UK and the European Union to leverage the supply chain established within the region and to respond to the growing demand in Europe for medical cannabis products. The regulatory environment will enable Columbia Care to supply other regions from the supply it has established for the UK and Germany. 
 Through its contractual arrangements, Columbia Care seeks to ensure that its partners have obtained the required licenses for their respective activities (including cultivation, manufacture, and distribution of medical cannabis) and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. See European Union Regulatory Environment.

 Figure 1: Columbia Care Footprint 
 


Columbia Care actively operates or has under development, cultivation and/or production assets in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Columbia Cares existing U.S. license portfolio allows for (i) an aggregate of approximately 2,278,710 square feet of indoor cultivation and production footprint (including operational, in development and optioned space) within its currently leased or owned facilities (including options to expand within such facilities), with the potential to produce more than 150,000 kg of dry flower on an annual basis and (ii) an aggregate of approximately 143.8 acres of outdoor cultivation and production footprint (including operational and optioned space). This capacity does not include the potential yield from Columbia Cares outdoor marijuana and industrial hemp acreage, which will vary seasonally. Since Columbia Care currently has operating facilities and projects under development across multiple jurisdictions in the United States, Columbia Care is not substantially dependent on any individual cultivation facility or dispensary. This data does not include any announced acquisitions subject to definitive agreements that have not yet closed.

 Columbia Cares refined cultivation practices have experienced several iterations since its inception. Its cultivation expertise reflects years of operating experience and specialized input from agricultural, manufacturing, scientific and security experts. The Company has implemented the best practices employed at its nationwide locations in each new facility that it develops and expects to continue to improve and optimize its methods and infrastructure to ensure competitiveness and excellence. 
 Columbia Cares production platform is designed to cultivate and manufacture cannabinoid-based products that are used specifically for medical use or consumer wellness, and health products produced to assure consistency and quality. Columbia Care engages national engineering consultants to design bespoke systems that follow industry best practices in order to produce its products. Columbia Care does all of this to optimize product quality, minimize the risk of exposing patients and consumers to potentially harmful contaminants while maximizing the effectiveness and consistency of the approved products delivered. 
 Columbia Care believes that a clean and sanitized growing and processing environment is key to ensuring the integrity of products. These self-imposed disciplines are more resource intensive than the industry standard, but are designed to yield a safe, consistent, contaminant-free product that will lead the market in quality, safety and efficacy. 
 Columbia Cares growing process is designed to maximize quality, consistency and yield, while limiting contamination by fungal and bacterial diseases, insect and vertebrate pests, non-organic pesticides and other harmful contaminants. Each step in Columbia Cares cultivation process, including (i) germination/propagation; (ii) vegetation; (iii) bloom; and (iv) harvest is carefully executed using refined standard operating procedures and training protocols. Columbia Care has standardized nutrient protocols, growing environments, water and irrigation strategies, growing mediums, climate controls, plant tracking, and staffing programs among other components of its cultivation and manufacturing operations. Its ultimate goal is to maximize the biomass output (grams per square foot) across all Columbia Care-operated facilities at the lowest cost possible without sacrificing product quality. 
 Extraction 
 Columbia Care utilizes a number of well-established, regulatory-approved methods for cannabinoid extraction and performs extraction of the leaves, trimmings and flowers of female cannabis plants to produce an approved cannabinoid product form. Once extracted, Columbia Cares expert formulation staff formulates proprietary extracts into easily administered consumer products and medications for patient and consumer delivery by following protocol and state regulations. 
Dispensaries 
 Columbia Care has, manages or is developing dispensaries in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia. All of Columbia Cares dispensaries have either licensed pharmacists or trained personnel on staff to ensure that customers and patients have access to knowledgeable personnel that can advise on the responsible use of cannabis including delivery formats and dosing schedules.

 Performance Indicators 
 As Columbia Care seeks to manage its development, management currently uses key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess its rate of growth and performance. These KPIs include top-line revenue, growth in gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP measure). These KPIs are further discussed in under Non-GAAP Measures in Item 2.Branding and Marketing 
 Columbia Care employs a diverse and knowledgeable staff of pharmacists and trained personnel for its dispensaries that reflect and embody its brand. Columbia Care has built its reputation on providing trusted, high-quality medical cannabis products to improve patients wellness journeys, which are also now available for adult-use consumption. The Company believes that Columbia Care has become known in the jurisdictions in which it operates as a trusted mark for health and wellness cannabis by constantly innovating to provide the best solutions for its patients and customers. As Columbia Care expands into new markets, it aims to be a leader in developing a national health and wellness cannabis brand, which in turn is expected to support its expansion into international jurisdictions. Revenues and expenses related to our international expansion have not been significant. 
 In May 2021, Columbia Care launched its Cannabist retail ecosystem. The Cannabist retail experience is centered on making shopping for cannabis as simple and approachable as possible, accommodating the vast range of experience levels among patients and customers. Merchandising set-ups and store layouts are organized to help customers move through the space with intent and become more comfortable in the process. Additionally, retail spaces are designed to encourage employees and customers to engage in conversations that enhance the shopping experience, whether through product recommendations or general education. To fully realize this goal, Cannabist staff undergo extensive training. Beyond the in-store experience, technology serves as a bridge across the retail ecosystem that enables a seamless shopping experience. Cannabist locations will continue to leverage existing solutions, such as Virtual.Care, the personal shopping platform, and a proprietary web-based application called Forage to help customers on their product discovery journey. Several dispensary locations in Utah, Arizona, Illinois, California, Massachusetts and Florida were transformed into Cannabist locations during 2021 with other company locations going through a similar transformation over the next twenty-four months. Columbia Care transformed all 14 Florida locations on December 8, 2021, bringing the total to 22 Cannabist locations nationwide. 
Cannabis-based Product Selection and Offerings 
 Columbia Care has continually been at the forefront of developing and introducing innovative and safe products to serve patients unique needs. Columbia Care offers a competitive product portfolio in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Depending on the jurisdiction, Columbia Care offers a variety of products, including, without limitation, flower, concentrates, edibles and/or accessories. As shown below, the product mix varies between jurisdictions. As such, Columbia Care benefits from its diverse and expanding product portfolio. 
 The Companys products have similar characteristics due to the same raw material ingredient (cannabis), similar nature of cultivation process, the type or class of customer and the regulatory nature of our industry. Revenues from transactions with no single external customer exceed 10% of the consolidated revenues. Revenue earned outside of the United States of America is immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States of America are immaterial as at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
 Columbia Care has begun to bring its family of branded products to all jurisdictions where it has manufacturing operations. Columbia Cares focus is to develop proprietary formulations and delivery technologies that provide patients and adult-use customers with high quality and differentiated products. 
 
25 


 In 2016, Columbia Care announced the launch of its line of controlled-dose, solid-fill medicinal cannabinoid capsules. Formulated using the full range of active cannabinoid ingredients from plants grown in its cultivation facilities, these proprietary capsules offer a variety of concentrations in a more accessible and convenient delivery form to patients and customers. 
 Columbia Care introduced proprietary, controlled-dose, hard-pressed tablets in New York State. The tablets are manufactured by segregating and formulating precise combinations of active compounds derived from targeted strains of cannabis plants. From the formulation of these tablets, Columbia Care introduced additional products to provide a spectrum of cannabinoid profiles to address the continuum of patient and consumer needs. This precisely engineered diversity of optimized cannabinoids includes the Companys patent pending Ceed line of medicinal cannabis products, including TheraCeed tablets, EleCeed sublingual tinctures and ClaraCeed vaporization oil. 
 In 2020, the Company launched Seed & Strain, its first lifestyle cannabis brand. Available in a number of markets, products include flower, pre-rolls and concentrates. Other product and branded categories include but are not limited to confections, chocolate, drink mixes, condiments, kief, shatter, and wax/crumble. Columbia Care launched Classix in five markets simultaneously in October 2021, and will bring the brand to additional markets. Triple Seven has also been expanded from California to other operational markets, which will continue beyond 2021. 
 Columbia Care intends to continue launching national brands across its medical and adult-use markets in order to maintain the consistency and quality of products that all patients and customers have come to expect from the Company. 
 None of Columbia Cares products have been shown to effectively treat or cure any disease. None of Columbia Cares products require approval by the FDA, and none of Columbia Cares products have been approved, reviewed or cleared by the FDA for any purpose. 
 Product Pricing 
 Columbia Cares prices vary based on market conditions and product pricing from non-cannabis suppliers. As a result of different tastes, preferences and customer demographics across its core markets, average dispensary sales differ significantly from state to state. 
 Caring for The Community We Serve 
 Having completed over 4 million sales transactions in multiple medicinal and adult-use cannabis markets since its inception, Columbia Cares team has accumulated significant experience in the treatment of large consumer and specialized patient populations, addressing a wide range of unique combination of qualifying conditions, symptoms and risks. Columbia Care has dedicated funding for research collaborations and initiatives with leading academic medical centers across the country to enhance patient care, inform the policy debate and empower healthcare and wellness professionals with data on best practices and safe and efficacious cannabinoid use. Through its public policy efforts, Columbia Care is also at the forefront of ensuring that social equity is a large part of legalization efforts across the United States. 
 Columbia Care has launched extensive patient care initiatives including utilizing anonymized patient data to facilitate product optimization and innovation on behalf of patient needs. These initiatives allow Columbia Care to develop products with specific patient symptoms and optimal patient outcomes in mind. As Columbia Care scales this proprietary patient database, it is expected to become an increasingly important aspect of Columbia Cares product development strategy as it invests in branded formulations and administration types that best respond to patient needs.

 Columbia Care has distinguished itself by establishing research collaborations with renowned medical and research institutions globally. The collaborations are designed to improve product efficacy and assess the medical utility in its products while enhancing patient safety. Columbia Care has developed innovative and collaborative working relationships with a number of leading academic, patient advocacy, research and healthcare organizations as well as partnerships with private, academic, agricultural, policy, sustainability and economic programs at various institutions in the pursuit of expanding the body of scientific knowledge related to cannabis. This focus is one of the principal foundations of Columbia Cares corporate culture and has materially contributed to Columbia Cares current position as one of the most qualified and experienced operators in certain regulated markets in the U.S. Some of the collaboration partners include but are not limited to researchers affiliated with the following institutions: Mount Sinai Hospital, Columbia University, Arizona State University, Brandeis University, The Center for Discovery in New York, The Dana Farber Cancer Institute, New York University, Albert Einstein/Montefiore Medical Center, Stanford University and Kings College London. 
 Banking and Processing 
 Columbia Care deposits funds from its dispensary operations into bank accounts established with various banking partners. The Company ensures that the banks used are fully aware of the nature of the business and industry in which the Company operates. Columbia Care currently accepts cash, cashless ATMs, and in certain locations the CNC card. The CNC card is the first store credit card in the cannabis industry, providing Columbia Care customers an alternative payment method in participating markets, increasing access to the Companys products. Payment methods currently vary by market. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Columbia Care earned retail revenues of approximately $4.5 million, $3.5 million and $2.1 million from the CNC program. Columbia Care does not consider the CNC program to be a material revenue stream. 
 Real Estate Strategy 
 In each market that Columbia Care enters, it spends a significant amount of time and resources selecting real estate in highly desirable locations with convenient access to healthcare communities and health and wellness providers and public transit, close proximity to major interstates and other traffic routes, ample parking, and the potential for significant foot traffic. Columbia Care targets retail spaces with a footprint of 2,500 to 7,500 square feet and cultivation/manufacturing facilities with a footprint of 20,000 to 65,000+ square feet, depending on the market and available real estate inventory. Columbia Cares practice is to secure leases with a base term of five to ten years with extension options for renewal terms of five years. 
 In-Store Pickup and Delivery 
 Columbia Care is currently associated with certain third-party platforms that offer pre-ordering for in-store pickup, online payment processing and home delivery services, where allowed by law. In all instances, patients are offered educational material and/or consultations regarding route of administration and dosing format. 
 Inventory Management 
 In the jurisdictions where Columbia Care is operational, it has comprehensive inventory management practices that are compliant with applicable state laws and regulations. Such practices ensure control over Columbia Cares cannabis and cannabis product inventory using seed to sale tracking software. See Columbia Care Compliance Program  Inventory and Security Policies. Columbia Cares practices are designed to preclude contamination to ensure the safety and quality of the products dispensed. 
 Information Technology 
 Columbia Care strategically invests in information technology infrastructure. In fiscal year 2021, Columbia Care has initiated an effort to consolidate its operational systems, to provide national governance over business 
 
27 


  process and intelligence across merchandise planning, inventory management, production, costing, order management, accounting, reporting and analysis. These systems will provide the flexibility to support global and multi-channel expansion. Columbia Care has invested in information technology security platforms which are designed to protect patient and customer records and personal information in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 Research and Development 
 Columbia Care has been tracking consented patient outcomes since 2013, and now has a research database of more than 23 million sales transactions across all sales locations. It is working with experts to analyze this anonymized data to devise new genetics and new products tailored to individual patient conditions and wellness states. 
 Columbia Care has operated a product development and process development center in its Rochester, New York cultivation and manufacturing location since 2014, and now also conducts these activities in San Diego, California and Denver, Colorado. At these facilities, unit-dose formulations of proprietary cannabinoid combinations are created, and methods of extraction and separation are scaled. Additional work to add automation to these efforts and commercial manufacturing is ongoing. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2021, Columbia Care had 2,586 employees across its operating jurisdictions, up from 1,775 employees as of December 31, 2020 as a result of the Green Leaf Medical acquisition. As of March 23, 2022, Columbia Care had approximately 2,564 employees. 
 Columbia Care is committed to: 
 

 | Hiring, training and retaining an efficient, hard-working and qualified labor force that reflects the racial, cultural and ethnic composition of the communities it serves, including people of color, veterans, older workers and persons with physical and/or cognitive disabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Providing a work environment that is free of unlawful harassment, discrimination and retaliation: in furtherance of this commitment, Columbia Care strictly prohibits all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Complying with all laws protecting qualified individuals with disabilities, as well as employees, independent contractors, vendors, unpaid interns and volunteers religious beliefs and observances.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Columbia Care is committed to all of the above without regard to race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, uniform service member and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, age, protected medical condition, genetic information, disability, or any other protected status in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. 
 Columbia Care employees are highly talented individuals who have educational achievements ranging from doctorates to masters to undergraduate degrees in a wide range of disciplines, as well as staff who have been trained on the job to uphold the highest standards as set by Columbia Care. It is currently a requirement that all of Columbia Cares employees pass background checks. 
 In addition, the safety of Columbia Cares employees is a priority and Columbia Care is committed to the prevention of illness and injury through the provision and maintenance of a healthy workplace. Columbia Care takes all reasonable steps to ensure staff are appropriately informed and trained to ensure the safety of themselves as well as others around them. 
 
28 


 Columbia Care strives to provide an equal opportunity for all its employees to pursue career advancement and to consistently look within its organization for potential job candidates prior to posting employment offerings externally. Importantly, it does not embrace these policies solely out of altruism or an obligation under state requirements, but because it has learned from experience that the organization thrives and becomes more productive by maintaining a culture of inclusion where everyone feels valued and their individual contributions are appreciated and rewarded. 
 Competition 
 Columbia Care competes with other retail, manufacturing and cultivation license holders across the states in which it operates, as well as additional states, assuming and upon completion of pending acquisitions and receipt of licenses applied for or contemplated to be applied for in such additional states. Many of Columbia Cares competitors are smaller, local operators, as well as an increasing number of operators with a significant presence in multiple states that compete directly with Columbia Care for regional market share. In certain markets, a number of dispensaries and cultivators operate illegally and compete directly with Columbia Care. However, Columbia Care expects that law enforcement will increasingly respond to illicit market operators. In addition to physical dispensaries, Columbia Care also competes with third-party delivery services, which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services. 
 Further, as more U.S. jurisdictions pass legislation allowing adult-use of cannabis, Columbia Care expects an increased level of competition in the U.S. market. A number of publicly-traded companies are expanding operations to states that have decriminalized cannabis consumption. The increasingly competitive U.S. state markets may adversely affect the financial condition and operations of Columbia Care. 
 See United States Regulatory Environment for additional details as to the regulatory environment in which Columbia Care operates. See Item 1ARisk Factors with respect to competition. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Columbia Care pursues patent and trademark protection around the world directed to its product and product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding cannabinoid products and devices. Patent prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or foreign equivalents is often significantly narrowed by the time they are issued, if issued at all. Columbia Care expects this may be the case with respect to its pending patent applications referenced below. 
 Columbia Cares intellectual property strategy seeks to provide protection for its product and product candidates, through the prosecution of different types of patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and worldwide. 
 Columbia Cares patent portfolio covers a number of its products and product candidates. As of March 23, 2022, this portfolio included 1 issued U.S. patent and at least 22 pending patent applications owned by Columbia Care, filed in one or more of three jurisdictions, including Canada, Europe and the U.S., which have strong patent systems. The issued U.S. patent is projected to expire in 2037. The patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2041, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 Our patent portfolio includes: 
 

 | 11 pending patent applications, filed in the US, Canada, and Europe, that protect our EleCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, and devices comprising the compositions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29 


 
 | 19 pending patent applications, filed in the US, Canada, and Europe, that protect our TheraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use, kits for their use, devices comprising the compositions, and cartridges for use in devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 9 pending patent applications, filed in the US, Canada, and Europe, that protect our ClaraCeed line of products, including claims directed to compositions, methods of their manufacture, methods of their use and administration, kits for their administration, and cartridges for use in devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | These patent applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2039, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.

 | and 2 patent applications, filed in the US and Europe, that protect our Seed & Strain DabTabs, including claims to compositions and methods of their use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | These applications, if granted, are projected to expire in 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the USPTO has granted many patents for cannabis-related technologies, none have yet been successfully enforced in court. Until U.S. courts definitively address the enforceability of cannabis-related patents, or cannabis products are legalized federally in the U.S., we cannot be certain that any of our patents can be effectively enforced against our competitors, even if their products infringe our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The USPTO may deny federal trademark registration if the trademark application covers goods or services that violate federal law, including cannabis products. However, certain hemp-derived goods, including hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC, as well as ancillary products or services, are considered lawful under federal law and may be eligible for federal trademark registration. Additionally, the USPTO may accept trademark applications for consulting services or goods that do not directly involve the cannabis flower, such as computer software, educational platforms, and brand apparel. Trademarks covering these lawful goods and services are generally enforceable in federal court. Cannabis goods and services that do not meet the USPTO standard for trademark registration may qualify for state trademark registration in states where such goods and services have been legalized, and are generally enforceable in state courts in those states. 
 No guarantee can be given that Columbia Care will be able to successfully assert its trademark rights, nor can the company guarantee that its trademark registrations will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to a product name, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against the company, could have a material adverse effect on Columbia Cares business. 
 In addition to patents and trademarks, Columbia Care relies upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain its competitive position. Columbia Care has developed numerous proprietary technologies and processes. While actively exploring the patentability of these techniques and processes, Columbia Care relies on non- disclosure/confidentiality arrangements and trade secret protection. 
 Columbia Care seeks to protect its proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with third parties, its collaborators, and scientific advisors, and as well as non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with its employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements it enters into are designed to protect its proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to the Company are designed to grant it ownership of technologies that are developed through its relationship with the respective counterparty. Columbia Care cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford it adequate protection of its intellectual property and proprietary information rights. 
 
30 


 Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, some of Columbia Cares trade secrets and know-how for which it decides to not pursue additional patent protection may, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. 
 UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 Federal Regulatory Environment 
 Under U.S. federal law, marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug. The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the CSA) classifies drugs in five different schedules. As a Schedule I drug, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Following the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (popularly known as the 2018 Farm Bill), cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content below 0.3% is classified as hemp and has been removed from the CSA. Lawfully cultivated hemp and products derived from it may now be sold into commerce and transported across state lines. The 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserves the authority of the FDA to regulate certain products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds such as CBD under the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In conjunction with the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the regulatory status of CBD, noting the FDAs position that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Despite its position, the FDAs enforcement actions against companies manufacturing CBD products has primarily been limited to the issuance of warning letters to companies whose products have made prohibited, misleading, and unapproved drug claims. Various states have also enacted state-specific laws pertaining to the handling, manufacturing, labeling, and sale of CBD and other hemp consumable products. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of hemp-derived CBD consumable products or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals to engage in such activities, other states restrict the sale of CBD products or prohibit such products outright. 
 Under federal law, cannabis having a concentration of THC greater than 0.3% is marijuana. The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I drug is inconsistent with what Columbia Care believes to be many valuable medical uses for marijuana accepted by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. As evidence of this, the federal FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from marijuana. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a cannabinoid found in both hemp and marijuana, which does not contain the intoxication properties of THC, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana. Columbia Care believes the CSA categorization as a Schedule I drug is not reflective of the medicinal properties of marijuana or the public perception thereof, and numerous studies show cannabis is not able to be abused in the same way as other Schedule I drugs, has medicinal properties, and can be safely administered. Moreover, while certain published studies show that marijuana may be less harmful than alcohol, alcohol is not classified under the CSA. This disparity may reflect the comparative stigma associated with marijuana that factors into scheduling decisions by the DEA. 
 The federal position is also not necessarily consistent with democratic approval of marijuana at the state government level in the United States. Thirty-seven (37) states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands have passed laws broadly legalizing marijuana for medicinal use by eligible patients. In the District of Columbia, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam and 18 of these states  Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia and Washington  marijuana is legal for adult-use regardless of medical condition, although not all of those jurisdictions have fully 
 
31 


  implemented their legalization programs. Voters in South Dakota also approved a constitutional amendment to legalize adult-use marijuana in the state, but Governor Kristi Noem sued to challenge the amendment for violating the state constitution. A circuit court judge struck down the law, and the state Supreme Court upheld that ruling. The large increase in recent statewide referenda and legislation that liberalizes marijuana laws is consistent with public opinion. As more and more states legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal prohibition under the CSA and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal law enforcement agencies and banking institutions through a series of United States Department of Justice (DOJ) memoranda. One example such memorandum was drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole in 2013 (the Cole Memo). 
 The Cole Memo offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states. The Cole Memo put forth eight prosecution priorities: 
 

1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
---+----------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing the violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.
---+------------------------------------------------------------

 On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Jefferson Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys (the Sessions Memo). Rather than establish national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo instructs that [i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the DOJs finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions. Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles. 
 The former Attorneys General who succeeded former Attorney General Sessions following his resignation did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to state-legal marijuana-related activities. President Joseph R. Biden was sworn in as the 46th United States President on January 20, 2021. President Biden nominated Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney General in his administration. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, confirmed on March 10, 2021, will re-adopt the Cole Memo or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Justice Garland stated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I dont think thats a useful use.1

 Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole Memo, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys. 
 In the absence of a uniform federal policy, as had been established by the Cole Memo, numerous United States Attorneys with state-legal marijuana programs within their jurisdictions have announced enforcement priorities for their respective offices. For instance, Andrew Lelling, the former United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, stated that while his office would not immunize any businesses from federal prosecution, he anticipated focusing the offices marijuana enforcement efforts on: (1) overproduction; (2) targeted sales to minors; and (3) organized crime and interstate transportation of drug proceeds.   Due to the CSA categorization of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, federal law also makes it illegal for financial institutions that depend on the Federal Reserves money transfer system to take any proceeds from marijuana sales as deposits. Banks and other financial institutions could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses under the United States Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (the Bank Secrecy Act). Therefore, under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering or conspiracy. 
 While there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws to accommodate businesses in the large and increasing number of U.S. states that have legalized medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in 2014, issued guidance to prosecutors of money laundering and other financial crimes (the FinCEN Guidance). The FinCEN Guidance advised prosecutors not to focus their enforcement efforts on banks and other financial institutions that serve marijuana-related businesses so long as that business is legal in their state and none of the federal enforcement priorities referenced in the Cole Memo are being violated (such as keeping marijuana away from children and out of the hands of organized crime). The FinCEN Guidance also clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations, including thorough customer due diligence, but makes it clear that they are doing so at their own risk. The customer due diligence steps include: 
 

1. | Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus adult-use customers);
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
33 


 With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available. 
 Because most banks and other financial institutions are unwilling to provide any banking or financial services to marijuana businesses, these businesses can be forced into becoming cash-only businesses. While the FinCEN Guidance decreased some risk for banks and financial institutions considering serving the industry, in practice it has not increased banks willingness to provide services to marijuana businesses. This is because, as described above, the current law does not guarantee banks immunity from prosecution, and it also requires banks and other financial institutions to undertake time-consuming and costly due diligence on each marijuana business they accept as a customer. In fact, some banks that had been servicing marijuana businesses have been closing the marijuana businesses accounts and are now refusing to open accounts for new marijuana businesses due to cost, risk, or both. 
 The few state-chartered banks and/or credit unions that have agreed to work with marijuana businesses are limiting those accounts to small percentages of their total deposits to avoid creating a liquidity risk. Since, theoretically, the federal government could change the banking laws as it relates to marijuana businesses at any time and without notice, these credit unions must keep sufficient cash on hand to be able to return the full value of all deposits from marijuana businesses in a single day, while also keeping sufficient liquid capital on hand to serve their other customers. Those state-chartered banks and credit unions that do have customers in the marijuana industry charge marijuana businesses high fees to pass on the added cost of ensuring compliance with the FinCEN Guidance. 
 Unlike the Cole Memo, however, the FinCEN Guidance from 2014 has not been rescinded. The former Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Stephen Mnuchin, publicly stated that the Department was not informed of any plans to rescind the Cole Memo. 
 Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo in 2018, Columbia Care continues to do the following towards ensuring compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memo, the FinCEN Guidance, and other best industry practices: 
 Columbia Care and its subsidiaries operate in compliance with licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. 
 Columbia Cares cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained  for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, products are sold only to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis. 
 Columbia Care performs due diligence on contractors or anyone provided access to secure areas of its facilities to prevent cannabis products from being distributed to minors. 
 Columbia Care works to ensure that the licensed operators have an adequate inventory tracking system and adequate procedures in place so that their compliance system can track inventory effectively. This is done so that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across state lines in general. 
 Columbia Care conducts background checks as required by applicable state law. 
 Columbia Care conducts reviews of activities of the cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of its licensed premises (including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation  e.g., transfer of 
 
34 


  products between licensed premises). These reviews are completed to ensure that licensed operators do not possess or use cannabis on federal property or engage in manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands. 
 Columbia Cares product packaging complies with applicable regulations and contains necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. 
 Moreover, in recent years, certain temporary federal legislative enactments that protect the medical marijuana and hemp industries have also been in effect. For instance, certain marijuana businesses receive a measure of protection from federal prosecution by operation of temporary appropriations measures that have been enacted into law as amendments (or riders) to federal spending bills passed by Congress and signed by both Presidents Obama and Trump. For instance, in the Appropriations Act of 2015, Congress included a budget rider that prohibits DOJ from expending any funds to enforce any law that interferes with a states implementation of its own medical marijuana laws. The rider is known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment after its original lead sponsors. 
 Originally, a Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate passed the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment. The bill was a bipartisan appropriations measure that looks to prohibit the DEA from spending funds to arrest state-licensed medical marijuana patients and providers. Subsequently, the amendment has been included in multiple budgets passed by a Republican-controlled Congress. While the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in successive appropriations legislation or resolutions since 2015, its inclusion or non-inclusion is subject to political change. 
 The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment was renewed most recently in the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2021, which funds the agencies of the federal government through September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2021, the Amendment was extended through the signing of a continuing resolution, effective through February 18, 2021, and has since been extended again until September 30, 2022. Notably, Rohrabacher-Farr has applied only to medical marijuana programs and has not provided the same protections to enforcement against adult-use activities. 
 There is a growing consensus among marijuana businesses and numerous congressmen and congresswomen that guidance is not law and temporary legislation is an inappropriate way to protect lawful medical marijuana businesses. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress in recent years to decriminalize aspects of state-legal marijuana trades. This has led to a bipartisan Congressional Marijuana Working Group in Congress. 
 Additionally, in 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the SAFE Banking Act), which had more than 200 cosponsors and would prevent federal banking regulators from taking adverse actions against financial institutions solely due to an institutions provision of financial services to state-legal marijuana businesses. The Act ultimately stalled and was not taken up for a vote by the United States Senate in the 2020 legislative session. On March 18, 2021, the SAFE Banking Act was reintroduced in the House of Representatives. On March 23, 2021, the bill was reintroduced in the Senate as well. On April 19, 2021 the House passed the SAFE Banking Act by a vote of 321-101. In an attempt to help get the SAFE Banking Act passed in the Senate, Representative Ed Perlmutter proposed that it be included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (the NDAA). The Act was added to the NDAA by a voice vote on September 21, 2021, and the NDAA passed the House in a 316-113 vote on September 23, 2021. Despite its continued success in the House, the Act was removed from the version of the NDAA passed by the Senate on December 7, 2021. 
 An additional challenge to marijuana-related businesses is that the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 280E (Section 280E), are being applied by the IRS to businesses operating in the medical and adult-use marijuana industry. Section 280E prohibits marijuana businesses from deducting ordinary and 
 
35 


  necessary business expenses, forcing them to pay higher effective federal tax rates than similar companies in other industries. As a result of Section 280E, the Companys effective tax rate can be highly variable and depends on how large its ratio of non-deductible expenses is to its total revenues. Therefore, businesses in the legal cannabis industry may be less profitable than they would otherwise be. 
 Following the federal elections of 2020, the Democratic Party won control of both U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, which has led some observers to predict that Congress will pass legislation that legalizes or decriminalizes marijuana or removes certain restrictions on financial services in the industry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is no guarantee that the SAFE Banking Act will become law in its current form, if at all. There also can be no assurance that the Biden administration will not change the stated policies or practices of the Department of Justice or individual United States Attorneys regarding the low-priority enforcement of U.S. federal laws that conflict with state laws. The Biden administration and the Congress could decide to enforce U.S. federal laws vigorously.

 Arizona Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2010, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 203, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.1, titled the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (the AMMA). The AMMA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes § 36-2801 et. seq. The AMMA also appointed the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) as the regulator for the program and authorized ADHS to promulgate, adopt and enforce regulations for the AMMA. These ADHS regulations are embodied in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 17 (the Medical Rules). ARS § 36-2801(12) defines a nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary as a not-for-profit entity that acquires, possesses, cultivates, manufactures, delivers, transfers, transports, supplies, sells or dispenses marijuana or related supplies and educational materials to cardholders. 
 The ADHS has established the medical marijuana program, which includes a vertically integrated license, meaning if allocated a Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificate (a Certificate), entities are authorized to dispense and cultivate medical cannabis. Each Certificate allows the holding entity to operate one on-site cultivation facility, and one off-site cultivation facility which can be located anywhere within the State of Arizona. An entity holding a Certificate is required to file an application to renew with the ADHS on an annual basis, which must also include audited annual financial statements. While a Certificate may not be sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed, Certificate holders typically contract with third parties to provide various services related to the ongoing operation, maintenance, and governance of its dispensary and/or cultivation facility so long as such contracts do not violate the requirements of the AMMA or the medical marijuana program. 
 The ADHS had until April 2012 to establish a registration application system for patients and nonprofit marijuana dispensaries, as well as a web-based verification platform for use by law officials and dispensaries to 
 
36 


  verify a patients status as such. It also specified patients rights, qualifying medical conditions, and allowed out-of-state medical marijuana patients to maintain their patient status (though not to purchase cannabis). On December 6, 2012, Arizonas first licensed medical marijuana dispensary opened in Glendale. Arizona recently enacted SB 1494, which, among other things will require testing of medical marijuana and require biannual renewal of agent licensure. 
 To qualify to use medical marijuana under the AMMA, a patient is required to have a debilitating medical condition. Valid medical conditions include HIV, cancer, glaucoma, immune deficiency syndrome, Hepatitis C, Crohns disease, agitation of Alzheimers disease, ALS, cachexia/wasting syndrome, muscle spasms, nausea, seizures, severe and chronic pain or another chronic or debilitating condition. 
 Arizona S.B. 1494 went into effect in August 2019. The bill authorized the ADHS to adopt rules for inspecting medical marijuana dispensaries and created an independent testing regime for marijuana cultivated by a medical marijuana dispensary. Beginning in November 2020, before marijuana is sold, it must be tested for unsafe levels of microbial contamination, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, growth regulators and residual solvents. 
 S.B. 1494 also authorized civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation (not to exceed $5,000 in a 30-day period) on medical marijuana dispensaries. The bill makes patient ID cards and medical marijuana dispensary registration certificates expire every two years rather than every year. Regulations implementing S.B. 1494 went into effect on August 27, 2019. In February 2020, the Department began an additional round of rulemaking designed to improve the regulations regarding independent testing. 
 In 2020, Arizona passed Ballot Proposition 207, which amended Title 36 to the Arizona Revised Statutes. This amendment added Chapter 28.2, titled the Smart and Safe Arizona Act (the SSAA). The SSAA is codified in Arizona Revised Statutes § 36-2850 et. seq. The SSAA appointed ADHS as the regulator for the program and required ADHS to promulgate, adopt, and enforce regulations for the SSAA. ADHS has published draft rules to administer the Adult- use Marijuana Program to be embodied in the Arizona Administrative Code Title 9 Chapter 18 (the Adult-use Rules; together with the Medical Rules, the Rules). These Adult-use Rules became effective on January 15, 2021. ARS § 36-2850 defines marijuana establishment as an entity licensed by the department to operate all of the following: a single retail location at which the licensee may sell marijuana and marijuana products to consumers, cultivate marijuana and manufacture marijuana products; a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers; and a single off-site cultivation location at which the licensee may cultivate marijuana, process marijuana and manufacture marijuana products, but from which marijuana and marijuana products may not be transferred or sold to consumers. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Arizona) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Arizona. 
 Arizona Medical Marijuana Licensing Requirements 
 In order for an applicant to receive a Certificate, it must: (i) fill out an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the applicants articles of incorporation and by-laws, (iii) submit fingerprints for each principal officer or board member of the applicant for a background check to exclude felonies, (iv) submit a business plan and policies and procedures for inventory control, security, patient education, and patient recordkeeping that are consistent with the AMMA and the Medical Rules to ensure that the dispensary will operate in compliance, and (v) designate an Arizona licensed physician as the Medical Director for the dispensary. Certificates are renewed annually so long as the dispensary is in good standing with ADHS, pays the renewal fee, and submits an independent third-party financial audit. 
 Once an applicant has been issued a Certificate, they are allowed to establish one physical retail dispensary location, one cultivation location which is co-located at the dispensarys retail site (if allowed by local zoning) 
 
37 


  and one additional off-site cultivation location. None of these sites can be operational, however, until the dispensary receives an approval to operate from ADHS for the applicable site. This approval to operate requires: (i) an application on the ADHS form, (ii) demonstration of compliance with local zoning regulations, (iii) a site plan and floor plan for the applicable property, and (iv) an in-person inspection by ADHS of the applicable location to ensure compliance with the Medical Rules and consistency with the dispensarys applicable policies and procedures. 
 Arizona Adult-use Marijuana Licensing Requirements 
 In order for an applicant to receive a marijuana facility agent license, it must submit to ADHS (i) the personal identification information prescribed by ADHS including a background check and fingerprints and (ii) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The license must be renewed every two years. A licensee may seek renewal by submitting to ADHS, at least thirty calendar days before the license expiration, (a) information on the license, (b) updated personal information including a criminal records check, and (c) the applicable fee as prescribed in the Adult- use Rules. 
 ADHS may issue one marijuana establishment license for every 10 pharmacies registered under § 32-1929 and no more than two licenses per county that contains no registered medical marijuana dispensaries, or one license per county that contains one registered medical marijuana dispensary. In the event that more complete and compliant applications are received than ADHS may issue, ADHS will issue the licenses according to criteria prescribed in the Adult-use Rules. The initial round of license applications were due March 9, 2021. 
 In order for an application to be considered complete and compliant such that an applicant may be considered for a marijuana establishment license, the applicant must (i) pay the appropriate non-refundable fee prescribed by ADHS, (ii) submit the ADHS-prescribed application, (iii) documentation of: facility agent licenses for principal officers and board members, good standing with the Arizona Corporation Commission, zoning compliance, ownership of or permission to use the physical address, and sufficient funds. 
 Applicants that have a Certificate issued under the Medical Rules, the applicant may apply for a marijuana establishment license by submitting (i) an attestation from each principal officer and board member approving the application, (ii) the license number on the applicants dispensary registration certificate, (iii) whether the applicant wants to transfer the cultivation site under the registration certificate to the marijuana license, and (iv) the applicable fee. 
 A holder of a marijuana establishment license may apply for approval to operate a marijuana establishment by submitting, within 18 months after the marijuana establishment license was issued, the following: (i) an application on the form prescribed by ADHS, (ii) documentation of local permission to use the property as a marijuana establishment (such as a certificate of occupancy, special use permit, or a conditional use permit), (iii) a list of activities the establishment is requesting, including cultivation, manufacturing, or preparation of edible products, (iv) a license of the location as a food establishment if preparing edible products, (v) a site plan, and (vi) a floor plan. 
 Marijuana establishments that received their license through the process for applicants with Certificates may begin operating without submitting the above if the entity holding the license (i) received approval to operate under the Medical Rules and (ii) is operating and available to dispense medical marijuana in accordance with the Medical Rules. 
 Marijuana establishment licenses must be renewed every two years.

 With the passage of S.B. 1494, certificates are renewed biennially. Before expiry, licensees are required to submit a renewal application. While renewals are granted annually, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable Certificate, 
 Columbia Care would expect Salubrious Wellness Clinic, Inc. and 203 Organix, LLC to receive the applicable renewed Certificate in the ordinary course of business. 203 Organixs Approval to Operate a cultivation facility in Wickenburg is not in use and is therefore not considered a material contract of Columbia Care.

 CALIFORNIA 
 California Regulatory Landscape 
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. 
 In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients. 
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However, in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. AUMA had some conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. The four agencies that originally regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC), California Department of Food and Agriculture (DFA), California Department of Public Health (DPH), and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. 
 On July 1, 2019, California enacted A.B. 97. In relevant part, the bill authorizes licensing authorities to issue citations and fines to a licensee or an unlicensed person who violates MAUCRSA. The maximum fine is $5,000 per violation for licensees and $30,000 per violation for unlicensed persons. Each day of a violation constitutes a separate violation. 
 A.B. 97 also repeals a prior requirement that an applicant for a provisional license first hold a temporary license. The bill also requires applicants for provisional licenses to submit evidence of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, limits the validity of a provisional license to 12 months with subsequent renewals as approved by the relevant licensing authority, and allows licensing authorities to revoke provisional licenses for failing to diligently pursue final licensure. Finally, the bill requires the DPH to establish a certification program for manufactured cannabis products comparable to the National Organic Program and the California Organic Food and Farming Act. 
 On October 12, 2019, California enacted A.B. 1529. The bill mandates that all cannabis vaping cartridges and cannabis vaporizers must include a universal symbol identifying the product as a vaping product. 
 On July 12, 2021, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 141 (AB-141), which creates the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC). The DCC will consolidate the states cannabis program 
 
42 


  oversight from three of the existing agencies  the BCC, the DFA, and the DPH  under a single department in an effort to centralize and simplify regulatory and licensing oversight in California. DCC similarly announced its intention to create a single Licensing Division that would be responsible for licensing of all cannabis businesses. On or about September 15, 2021, the DCC filed emergency regulations to consolidate, clarify, and make consistent cannabis regulations to the California Office of Administrative Law. After a limited comment period, these consolidated emergency regulations were approved and became effective on or about September 27, 2021. These regulations created consistent standards for cannabis licensees across all license types, by aligning application requirements, unifying terminology, and clarifying ownership and financial interest requirements. 
 At present, to legally operate a medical or adult-use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with marijuana licensing programs. Therefore, cities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators or can choose to outright ban marijuana. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of California) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of California.

California Licensing Requirements 
 A medicinal retailer license permits the sale of medicinal cannabis and cannabis products to a medicinal cannabis patient in California who possesses a physicians recommendation. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older who presents a valid government-issued photo identification. 
 An adult-use or medicinal cultivation license permits cannabis cultivation activity which means any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and the sales of cannabis to certain licensed entities within the state of California for resale or manufacturing purposes. 
 An adult-use or medical manufacturing license permits the manufacturing of cannabis products. Manufacturing includes the compounding, blending, extracting, infusion, packaging or repackaging, labeling or relabeling, or other preparation of a cannabis product. 
 In the state of California, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. Although California is not a vertically-integrated system, the state allows licensees to make wholesale purchase of cannabis from, or a distribution of cannabis and cannabis product to, another licensed entity within the state. 
 Holders of marijuana licenses in California are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations, as promulgated by each applicable state agency, should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area.

 California Dispensary Requirements 
 Cannabis retailers may only sell cannabis products that were received by the retail licensee from a licensed distributor or licensed microbusiness authorized to engage in distribution, and the licensed retailer must verify that the cannabis goods have not exceeded their best-by, sell-by, or expiration date if one is provided. The goods must have undergone appropriate laboratory testing, and the batch number labeled on the package of cannabis goods must match the batch number on the corresponding certificate of analysis for regulatory compliance testing. The packaging and goods must comply with all applicable laws in order for the goods to be sold at the retail location. In addition to cannabis goods, a licensed retailer may sell only cannabis accessories and licensees branded merchandise. A licensed retailer may not provide free cannabis goods except for in certain limited circumstances. 
 Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display. 
 California Reporting Requirements 
 The state of California uses METRC as the states track-and-trace (T&T) system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all state-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to METRC. 
California Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, Californias marijuana businesses are required to do the following: 

 | maintain a fully operational security alarm system;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | contract for security guard services;
--+--------------------------------------


 | maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ensure that the facilitys outdoor premises have sufficient lighting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 COLORADO 
 Colorado Regulatory Landscape 
 On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. On November 6, 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which amended the state constitution to establish an adult use cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed under the regulatory framework. As of January 1, 2020, medical and adult use marijuana are regulated together under a single statute  the Colorado Marijuana Code. 
 Under the Colorado Marijuana Code, the Colorado Department of Revenue is empowered to grant licenses to both adult use and medical marijuana businesses, including cultivation facilities, products manufacturers, testing facilities, transporters, researchers and developers, and (in the adult use context) accelerator cultivators, accelerator stores, and hospitality businesses. 
 Cannabis businesses must also comply with local licensing requirements. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana businesses. 
 Columbia Care in Colorado is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Colorado. 
 Colorado License Requirements 
 An application for a marijuana business in Colorado requires submission of (1) a copy of any local license required for the marijuana business, (2) a certificate of good standing from the jurisdiction in which the business was formed, (3) the identity and address of the registered agent in Colorado, (4) organizational documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, and similar documents, (5) corporate governance documents, (6) a deed, lease, or similar document establishing the applicants ability to use the proposed premises, (7) a facility diagram, (8) findings of suitability with respect to the business owners, (8) information regarding securities listings (if the business is publicly traded), (9) financial statements, and documents related to payments of taxes. A business is required to obtain permission from its locality as part of the licensing process.

 Regulatory Requirements 
 The regulations establish requirements applicable to all marijuana businesses, along with specific requirements for each type of business. 
 All marijuana businesses in Colorado are required to (1) create and enforce limited access areas for the protection of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) maintain security alarm systems installed and maintained by a licensed alarm installation company, as well as approved locks and surveillance equipment, (3) follow all applicable laws regarding waste disposal (including cannabis-containing wastes), (4) implement an inventory tracking system used for inventory tracking and recordkeeping, (5) comply with both state and local requirements as to hours of operation, (6) comply with sanitary requirements applicable to employees and production spaces, including sanitation audits, (7) comply with recordkeeping requirements, and (8) maintain and provide procedures for dealing with product recalls. 
 Cultivation facilities are additionally required to (1) provide and maintain copies of standard operating procedures for cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, trimming, packaging, storing, and sampling, (2) comply with requirements related to pesticides, and (3) comply with additional sanitary and product safety requirements. Marijuana products manufacturers are required to (1) comply with labeling and dosing requirements related to standardized doses of marijuana, (2) comply with specific prohibitions regarding the shapes, colors, and similar characteristics of edible products, refrain from use of prohibited additives and ingredients, (3) maintain and provide standard operating procedures related to manufacturing of each category of products. Marijuana dispensaries are subject to additional requirements regarding (1) methods of accepting orders, (2) payments by customers, and (3) identification of customers. 
 The Marijuana Enforcement Division and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present. 
 Colorado uses METRC as the Marijuana Enforcement Divisions marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities. 
 DELAWARE 
 Delaware Regulatory Landscape 
 Delawares medical marijuana program is governed by the Delaware Medical Marijuana Act, 16 Del. C. 
 § 4901A et seq., and the Department of Health and Social Services (the Department) implementing regulations, CDR 16-4000-4470. The program authorizes registered qualified patients with a debilitating medical condition to use marijuana. Debilitating medical condition includes: (a) terminal illness, cancer, HIV, AIDS, decompensated cirrhosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, agitation of Alzheimers disease, PTSD, intractable epilepsy, seizure disorder, glaucoma, chronic debilitating migraines; (b) a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition or its treatment that produces cachexia or wasting syndrome; severe, debilitating pain that has not responded to previously prescribed medication or surgical measures for more than 3 months or for which other treatment options produced serious side effects; intractable nausea; seizures; severe and persistent muscle spasms, including those characteristic of multiple sclerosis; and (c) other medical conditions or treatments that may be added by the Department. Citizens may petition the Department to add conditions or treatments to the list of debilitating medical conditions. 
 The medical marijuana program creates a licensing regime for medical marijuana compassion centers (Compassion Centers). Compassion Centers must be operated on a non-profit basis. Once registered, a 
 
50 


  Compassion Center may acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or dispense marijuana strictly for the purpose of assisting registered patients or their designated caregivers with the medical use of marijuana. Compassion Centers are required to grow an amount of marijuana sufficient to meet demand but may not possess more than 1,000 pounds of usable marijuana without having a variance approved by the Department. Delaware prohibits Compassion Centers from purchasing marijuana from any person other than another Compassion Center. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Delaware) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Delaware. 
 Delaware License Requirements 
 Applicants for a license to operate a Compassion Center must include a US$5,000 application fee along with identifying documentation about the proposed Compassion Center, such as the proposed legal name, bylaws, articles of incorporation, and proposed address. An application must include information about the proposed facility, including: a description of the enclosed, locked facility, meeting all Department requirements for use in the cultivation of marijuana; and a description of proposed security and safety measures which demonstrate compliance with the Departments regulations. The Department also requires applicants to disclose financial and organizational information. Such information must include evidence of the Compassion Centers non-profit status; identifying information for each principal officer and board member; a draft operations manual which demonstrates compliance with the Departments regulations; a list of persons or business entities having direct or indirect authority over the management or policies of the Compassion Center; a list of persons or business entities having 5.0% or more ownership in the Compassion Center, including owners of any business entity which owns all or part of the land or building; and the identities of creditors holding a security interest in the premises, if any. Applications must also include an example of the design and security features of medical marijuana containers which demonstrates compliance with the regulations. 
 When the Department notifies an applicant that its application to operate a Compassion Center has been approved, it must submit a number of additional items before the registration certificate authorizing operation of a Compassion Center will be issued: a certification fee of US$40,000; the legal name, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the Compassion Center; the physical address of the Compassion Center and any other address used for cultivation; evidence of compliance with zoning laws, other location restrictions, and the State Fire Code; and updates to previously submitted information. 
 Delaware Dispensary Requirements 
 Registered Compassion Centers are required to keep detailed financial reports of proceeds and expenses; maintain inventory, sales, and financial records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and provide Department or Department-contracted audit firms with access to its books and records. 
 Compassion Centers must comply with a detailed process for disposing of unusable marijuana. A Compassion Center must immediately update its inventory system to reflect a disposal of marijuana, and the marijuana waste must be stored, secured, and managed in a manner that renders the waste unusable. Delaware also prohibits the use of pesticides on marijuana. 
 The Department has promulgated regulations specific to the dispensing of marijuana. Marijuana must be dispensed in sealed, tamperproof containers clearly identified as having been issued by the Compassion Center and that include certain disclosures. The containers should be accompanied by written instruction that the marijuana shall remain in this container when it is not being prepared for ingestion or being ingested. Compassion Centers must verify the patients or caregivers identification card as valid before dispensing marijuana, and marijuana must not be dispensed to a person other than a qualifying patient or primary caregiver. The maximum amount a Compassion Center can dispense to a single patient is 3 ounces during a 14-day period.

 Delaware Licenses 
 Columbia Care operates through a management services arrangement with Columbia Care Delaware LLC, a non- profit affiliate that holds a Compassion Center license and operates a dispensary and a manufacturing center, as noted in the table below. 
 

Holding Entity | Permit/License | City | Expiration/RenewalDate (if applicable)(MM/DD/YY) | Description

 Compassion Centers registrations expire every two years. A renewal application must be submitted between 90 and 30 days prior to the expiration of the current registration certificate. With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care Delaware LLC would expect to receive the applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business. 
 Delaware Security, Storage, and Transportation Requirements 
 Compassion Centers must store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security. The adequacy of security is to be determined based on the quantity of usable marijuana on hand, the Compassion Centers inventory system, the number of people with access to the marijuana, the location of the Compassion Center, the scope and sustainability of the alarm system, and the root cause analysis of any prior breaches. Compassion Centers are also subject to detailed security and inventory-management requirements. A Compassion Center must implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana. This includes access and entry limitations; maintaining a fully operational alarm system with immediate automatic notification to alert local authorities of a security breach; maintaining a log of security inspections and tests, alarm activations, and security breaches; and instituting a 24/7 video surveillance system covering areas in which marijuana is handled. The Department has also instituted a number of inventory controls. Compassion Centers must utilize a bar-coding inventory control system to track sales and inventory data; store marijuana in a locked area with adequate security; and conduct and document monthly inventory reviews and bi-annual comprehensive inventory reviews. 
 A registered Compassion Center agent must have documentation when transporting marijuana on behalf of the registered Compassion Center that specifies the amount of marijuana being transported, the date the marijuana is 
 
52 


  being transported, the registry ID certificate number of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility, and a contact number to verify that the marijuana is being transported on behalf of the registered Compassion Center or registered safety compliance facility. 
 Department Inspections 
 Compassion Centers are also subject to inspections by the Departments Office of Medical Marijuana. These inspections may include: a review of the Compassion Centers financial and dispensing records; a review of the physical facility; an inspection for pesticides, fungus, or mold; and random sampling of marijuana plants. Moreover, the Department or an independent auditor with which it contracts shall at all times have access to all books and records kept by any Compassion Center. 
FLORIDA 
 Florida Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act which was the first legal medical cannabis program in the states history. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed with a 71.3% majority on November 8. This language amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the states medical cannabis program. 
 The Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative, Amendment 2 (Amendment 2), and the expanded qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations, and patients are also subject to Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and § 381.986 of the Florida Statutes. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017. The law regulating Amendment 2 provides for another four licenses to be issued for every 100,000 patients added to the states medical marijuana registry and allows growers to open 25 dispensaries, plus an additional five dispensaries for every 100,000 patients. The 2017 legislations cap on dispensing facilities expired on April 1, 2020 and there is now no limit. There is also no state-imposed limitation on the permitted size of cultivation or processing facilities in Florida, nor is there a limit on the number of plants that may be grown. The Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use (OMMU) is expected to issue up to 27 new vertically integrated medical marijuana treatment center licenses by July 1, 2023. 
 Additionally, in 2017, the Florida legislature passed an act developing an industrial hemp pilot project, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Florida. The pilot project allowed for the research of industrial hemp. In 2019, the State Hemp Program (the FL Act) became effective and expanded the hemp program in Florida. The FL Act permitted the development of a state hemp plan by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). In 2020, FDACS submitted a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved Floridas plan. 
 The Florida Hemp Program includes several regulatory requirements. FDACS requires any individual or entity processing, manufacturing, distributing, retailing, or growing hemp to obtain a permit with FDACS. Other requirements include testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; inventory of land used for cultivation of hemp; disposal procedure plans; submission to inspection by and information sharing with FDACS; and state certification. Intentional violations of the Act and FDACSs rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license. 
 
53 


 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Florida) is materially compliant with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Florida. 
 Florida Licenses 
 Subsection 381.986(8)(a) of the State of Florida Statutes provides a regulatory framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MMTC), to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Licenses issued by the Department may be renewed biennially so long as the license meets the requirements of the law and the license holder pays a renewal fee. License holders can only own one license. 
 Under the terms of its MMTC license, Columbia Cares 100%-owned subsidiary, Columbia Care Florida, is permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the state. Only certified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients and their medical cannabis orders on the Florida Office of Compassionate Use Registry. Pursuant to subsection 381.986(8)(a)(5)(b) of the State of Florida Statutes, MMTCs may not establish more than the maximum number of dispensing facilities allowed in each region of the state, as determined by the Department of Health based on a population-centric formula. Dispensaries may otherwise be in any geographic location within the state as long as the local municipalitys zoning regulations authorize such a use and the proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and not within 500 feet of a church or school. In the State of Florida, only cannabis that is grown in the state can be sold in the state. As Florida is a vertically integrated system, Columbia Care Florida is able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver its own medical cannabis products. The State of Florida also allows Columbia Care Florida to make a wholesale purchase of medical cannabis from, or a distribution of medical cannabis to, another licensed dispensing organization within the state under certain circumstances such as crop failure.

Columbia Care Florida LLC | License to Cultivate Hemp 12_4B86A8D7 | Arcadia,FL | 01/12/22 | License to cultivateindustrial hemp. 

Florida Reporting Requirements 
 The Florida Department of Health requires that any licensee establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the Florida Department of Health to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed, and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Additionally, the Florida Department of Health also maintains a patient and physician registry and Columbia Care must comply with requirements and regulations relative to providing required data or proof of key events to said system. 
Florida Licensing Requirements 
 Licenses issued by the Department may be renewed biennially so long as the licensee meets requirements of the law and pays a renewal fee. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care 
 
54 


  Florida would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. While Columbia Cares compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material violations of a license arising, there is no assurance that the licenses will be renewed in the future in a timely manner. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the licensing renewal process could impede the ongoing or planned operations of Columbia Care and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. 
 MMTC license holders can only own one license. An MMTC applicant must demonstrate that: (i) they have been registered to do business in the State of Florida for the previous five years, (ii) they possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture, (iii) they have the technical and technological ability to cultivate and produce cannabis, including, but not limited to, low-THC cannabis, (iv) they have the ability to secure the premises, resources, and personnel necessary to operate as an MMTC, (v) they have the ability to maintain accountability of raw materials, finished products, and by-products to prevent diversion or unlawful access to or possession of these substances, (vi) they have an infrastructure reasonably required to dispense cannabis to registered qualified patients statewide or regionally as determined by the Department, (vii) they have the financial ability to maintain operations for the duration of the two-year approval cycle, including the provision of certified financial statements to the Department, (viii) its owners, officers, board members and managers have passed a Level II background screening, inclusive of fingerprinting, and ensure that a medical director is employed to supervise the activities of the MMTC, and (ix) they have a diversity plan and veterans plan accompanied by a contractual process for establishing business relationships with veterans and minority contractors and/or employees. Upon approval of the application by the Department, the applicant must post a performance bond of up to US$5 million, which may be reduced by meeting certain criteria such as a minimum patient count. 
 Florida Dispensary Requirements 
 An MMTC may not dispense to a patient more than a 70-day supply of cannabis within a 70-day period, except an MMTC may not dispense more than a 35-day supply of marijuana in a form for smoking within a 35-day period. By law, a 35-day supply is 2.5 ounces of whole flower. The MMTC employee who dispenses the cannabis must enter into the registry his or her name or unique employee identifier. The MMTC must verify that: (i) the qualified patient and the caregiver, if applicable, each has an active registration in the registry and active and valid medical cannabis use registry identification card, (ii) the amount and type of cannabis dispensed matches the physician certification in the registry for the qualified patient, and (iii) the physician certification has not already been filled. An MMTC may not dispense to a qualified patient younger than 18 years of age, only to such patients caregiver. An MMTC may not dispense or sell any other type of cannabis, alcohol, or illicit drug-related product, except a cannabis delivery device as specified in the physician certification. An MMTC must, upon dispensing, record in the registry: 
 (i) the date, time, quantity and form of cannabis dispensed, 
 (ii) the type of cannabis delivery device dispensed, and 
 (iii) the name and registry identification number of the qualified patient or caregiver to whom the cannabis delivery device was dispensed. An MMTC must ensure that patient records are not visible to anyone other than the patient, caregiver, and MMTC employees. 
 Florida Security, Transportation, and Storage Requirements 
 Each MMTC must maintain a video surveillance system with specified features. MMTCs must retain video surveillance recordings for at least 45 days, or longer upon the request of law enforcement.

ILLINOIS 
 Illinois Regulatory Landscape 
 The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition access to medical marijuana, became effective January 1, 2014 and has since been made permanent and retitled as the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act. There are over 35 qualifying conditions as part of the medical program, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which provides access to medical marijuana for individuals who have or could receive a prescription for opioids. 
 Illinois retail market size for medical cannabis in 2018 was over US$136 million, representing an over 160% year- over-year increase. Total retail sales by licensed medical cannabis dispensaries since November 2015 are over US$1.1 billion in aggregate. 
 In March 2018, Cook County voters (Cook County is the most populous county in the state, encompassing all of Chicagoland metro area) responded positively for state-wide adult-use legalization with a 63% majority in a non- binding vote. In November 2018, Illinois elected J.B. Pritzker as governor. Pritzker supported legalizing marijuana during his campaign. 
 
56 


 Illinois enacted the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in June 2019 (the IL Act). The IL Act legalized the adult use of marijuana effective January 1, 2020. Under the IL Act, Illinois residents age 21 and older are allowed to possess any combination of (i) up to 30 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 500 mg of THC; and (iii) 5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. Non-residents can possess any combination of (i) up to 15 grams of raw marijuana, (ii) marijuana infused products containing no more than 250 mg of THC; and (iii) 2.5 grams of marijuana in concentrated form. The IL Act authorizes the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021. Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License to serve adult users at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. No person can hold a financial interest in more than 10 dispensing organizations. 
 Following backlash related to the IDFPRs adult-use license rollout, on July 15, 2021, Governor Pritzker signed House Bill 1443, now Public Act 102-0098, modifying the IL Act and the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act and establishing a more comprehensive criteria to award the adult-use licenses. Lotteries for the adult-use licenses were held July 29, 2021, August 5, 2021, and August 19, 2021. IDFPR has issued 110 Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses to date. 
 The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available between the states medical and adult-use programs. As with existing medical dispensaries, existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License. The Department has issued approximately 21 Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Centers to date. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation center are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. The Department is also permitted to license up to 40 craft growers and 40 infuser organizations by July 1, 2020 and another 60 of each license type by the end of 2021. To date, the Department has issued 82 craft grower licenses and 31 infuser licenses. 
 The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees and requires prospective licensees to demonstrate their plans for complying with the requirements. Applicants for dispensary licenses must, for example, include an employee training plan, a security plan, recordkeeping and inventory plans, a quality control plan, and an operating plan. Applicants for craft growers must similarly submit a facility plan, an employee training plan, a security a record keeping plan, a cultivation plan, a product safety and labeling plan, a business plan, an environmental plan, and more. 
 Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste- management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually. 
 The Illinois Department of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations for cultivators, craft growers, infuser organizations, and transporting organizations, and the IDFPR is authorized to regulate dispensaries. The Department of Agricultures final rules took effect on June 3, 2020, while the IDFPR has not yet issued final regulations for the adult- use program. 
 The IDFPR issued an emergency rule regarding relocation of Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization Licenses (Early Approval License), which became effective on October 12, 2021 and will expire 150 days from the effective date. This rule permits Early Approval License holders to apply to relocate their dispensary on a form prescribed by the IDFPR.

 Additionally, in 2015, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Pilot Program became effective pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill. This statute enabled researchers and higher education institutions to grow hemp for educational and research purposes. The Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) administered the Industrial Hemp Pilot Program. In 2018, the Illinois Industrial Hemp Act (the IL Hemp Act) became effective. The IL Hemp Act allowed for the growing and processing to expand beyond researchers and higher education institutions and allowed planting and processing by farmers and others. IDOA was given authority to develop and oversee rules for the state hemp program. 
 IDOA promulgated rules for the states hemp program in 2019. An individual or entity cultivating, processing, or handling hemp must obtain a license from IDOA. The IL Hemp Act subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include filing a report on the harvest and planting; submission to inspection and sampling at the discretion of IDOA; testing to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; and certain restrictions on the sale and transport of hemp. Intentional violations of the IL Hemp Act and IODAs rules may result in criminal penalties and a loss of license. Repeated negligent violation may result in a suspension of license. 
 In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Illinois hemp production plan. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the State of Illinois) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Illinois. 
 Illinois Licenses 
 The table below lists the licenses issued to Columbia Care with respect to its operations in Illinois. Under applicable laws, the licenses permit Columbia Care to, collectively, cultivate and dispense marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation under the provisions of Illinois Revised Statutes 410 ILCS 130 and 410 ILCS 705. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Illinois. 
 There are two categories of medical cannabis licenses in Illinois: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity. All cultivation/processing establishments must register with Illinois Department of Agriculture. All dispensaries must register with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. If applications contain all required information, and after vetting by officers, establishments are issued a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email from the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and include a renewal form. Adult-use dispensary licenses must be renewed with the IDFPR prior to March 31 of every even-numbered year, while adult-use cultivation center licenses must be renewed annually.

 MASSACHUSETTS (MEDICAL) 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has authorized the cultivation, possession and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Massachusetts marijuana businesses. The Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the MUMP) registers qualifying patients, personal caregivers, Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (MMTCs), and MMTC agents. The MUMP was established by Chapter 369 of the Acts of 2012, An Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana, following the passage of the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Initiative, Ballot Question 3, in the 2012 general election. Additional statutory requirements governing the MUMP were enacted by the Legislature in 2017 and codified at G.L. c. 94I, et. seq. (the Massachusetts Medical Act). MMTC Certificates of Registration are vertically integrated licenses in that each MMTC Certificate of Registration entitles a license holder to one cultivation facility, one processing facility and one dispensary location. There is a limit of three (3) MMTC licenses per person/entity. 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) regulations, 935 CMR 501.000 et seq. (Massachusetts Medical Regulations), provide a regulatory framework that requires MMTCs to cultivate, process, transport and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically integrated marketplace. Patients with debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the program, including conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), hepatitis C, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohns disease, Parkinsons disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS) when such diseases are debilitating, and other debilitating conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patients healthcare provider. The CCC assumed control of the MUMP from the Department of Public Health on December 23, 2018. 
 Effective January 8, 2021, the CCC repealed certain regulations applicable to co-located medical and adult use facilities and incorporated them into the adult use regulations at 935 CMR 500.00 and the medical regulations at 935 CMR 501.000, as part of an overall update of both sets of regulations. The updated regulations also included the following significant changes:

MMTCs can apply to change their tier classification to expand or reduce production. 
 The siting of MMTC locations is expressly subject to local/municipal approvals pursuant to state law, and municipalities control the permitting application process that an MMTC must comply with. More specifically, an MMTC shall comply with all local requirements regarding siting and unless a locality adopts a less restrictive requirement, an MMTC shall not be sited within a radius of five hundred feet of a school, daycare center, or any facility in which children commonly congregate. The 500-foot distance under this section is measured in a straight line from the nearest point of the facility in question to the nearest point of the proposed MMTC. The Massachusetts Regulations require that MMTCs limit their inventory of seeds, plants, and useable marijuana to reflect the projected needs of registered qualifying patients. An MMTC shall only dispense to a registered qualifying patient or caregiver who has a current valid certification. 
 Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Medical) 
 An MMTC shall implement sufficient security measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and theft of marijuana at the MMTC. These measures must include: (i) allowing only registered qualifying patients, caregivers, dispensary agents, authorized persons, or approved outside contractors access to the MMTC facility; (ii) preventing individuals from remaining on the premises of an MMTC if they are not engaging in activities that are permitted; (iii) disposing of marijuana or byproducts in compliance with law; (iv) establishing limited access areas accessible only to authorized personnel; (v) storing finished marijuana in a secure locked safe or vault; (vi) keeping equipment, safes, vaults or secured areas securely locked; (vii) ensuring that the outside perimeter of the MMTC is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance; and (viii) ensuring that landscaping or foliage outside of the MMTC does not allow a person to conceal themselves.

The video surveillance system shall have the capacity to remain operational during a power outage. The MMTC shall also maintain a backup alarm system with the capabilities of the primary system, and both systems shall be maintained in good working order and shall be inspected and tested on regular intervals. 
Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Medical) 
 An MMTC, as an element of its License, is licensed to transport its marijuana to other licensed establishments. Marijuana may only be transported between licensed MMTCs by registered MMTC Agents. Licensed Marijuana Transporters may also transfer marijuana to or from an MMTC. The originating and receiving licensed MMTCs shall ensure that all transported Marijuana Products are linked to the Seed-to-sale tracking program. Any Marijuana Product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination MMTC shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting marijuana must be staffed with a minimum of two MMTC Agents. Prior to leaving an MMTC for the purpose of transporting marijuana, the originating MMTC must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all marijuana to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the destination MMTC, the destination MMTC must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, the marijuana. The marijuana must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. Transportation times and routes are randomized and all transport routes remain within

An MMTC shall immediately upon request make available to the CCC information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, and the CCC may direct an MMTC to test marijuana for contaminants. Any violations found will be noted in a deficiency statement that will be provided to the MMTC, and the MMTC shall thereafter submit a Plan of Correction to the CCC outlining with particularity each deficiency and the timetable and steps to remediate the same. The CCC has the authority to suspend or revoke an MMTC license and to take other disciplinary actions against MMTC license holders. 
 MASSACHUSETTS (ADULT-USE)
Adult-use (recreational) marijuana has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The Cannabis Control Commission (the CCC), a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, Marijuana Establishments) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use marijuana facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
 Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
Existing MMTCs are given priority status over other applicants (except Economic Empowerment Priority Applicants) in applying for licensure as a Marijuana Establishment. However, the CCC has limited the scope of the priority applicant status to the functions and locations that the MTC currently operates. The same material application requirements exist for a Marijuana Establishment license as an MTC application; namely an application for an MTC license must include an Application of Intent, a Background Check, and a Management and Operations Profile including the content specified in the Massachusetts (Medical) section above. 
 
69 


 The adult-use license application process commenced on April 1, 2018 for existing MMTC license holders, and on July 1, 2018 for all non-MMTC license holders. Existing MMTC license holders that timely applied for an adult-use license on or before April 1, 2018 are eligible to receive three adult-use licenses per medical MMTC license. Namely, one integrated MMTC medical license is eligible, if awarded by the CCC, to receive three adult-use licenses as follows: one for cultivation, one for processing, and one for dispensary. Additionally, there are 11 tiers of cultivator licenses ranging from a maximum of 5,000 square feet (Tier 1) to between 90,001 to 100,000 square feet of canopy (Tier 11). 
 Patriot Care Corp. applied for adult-use licenses for facilities in Lowell, Massachusetts and Greenfield, Massachusetts in May and June 2018. On September 6, 2018, the CCC approved provisional licenses for retail, manufacturing, and cultivation in Lowell, Massachusetts, and retail in Greenfield, Massachusetts. On January 25, 2019, the CCC approved and thereafter issued final marijuana establishment licenses for retail, manufacturing and cultivation of adult-use marijuana in Lowell and retail of adult-use marijuana in Greenfield. 
 The final licenses allow Patriot Care Corp. to operate the Marijuana Establishments. The licenses are listed in the table below.

 MISSOURI 
 Missouri Regulatory Landscape 
 Article XIV of the Missouri Constitution (Article XIV) provides that state-licensed physicians may recommend marijuana to patients for medical purposes and allows for the limited, regulated production, distribution, sale and purchase of marijuana for medical use. At a high level, Article XIV authorizes the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) to promulgate rules for the proper regulation and control of the cultivation, manufacture, dispensing, and sale of marijuana for medical uses, including the licensure of entities authorized to undertake those activities, operational standards for those activities, taxation of retail sales of marijuana for medical use, and the registration of qualified patients. In Missouri, a qualified patient is one that suffers from cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, intractable migraines, a condition that causes severe and persistent pain, a debilitating psychiatric disorder, HIV/AIDs, a terminal illness, a chronic condition that normally requires a prescription medication that could be physically or psychologically addictive, or another chronic or debilitating condition as certified by a physician. 
 Pursuant to Article XIV, DHSS promulgated final rules governing the medical marijuana program in May 2019. Following promulgation of the rules, DHSS also undertook a process competitively to license entities in the areas of laboratory testing, cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and transportation in summer 2019. DHSS reported that it received approximately 2,270 applications for the various facility licenses, including 582 cultivation facility applications, 430 manufacturing facility applications, and 1,219 dispensary facility applications. Among these, DHSS issued 60 cultivation licenses, 86 manufacturing licenses, 192 dispensary licenses, and 10 laboratory testing licenses. These are the maximum number of licenses currently available under DHSSs regulations, though the regulations state that DHSS may in the future determine that additional licenses should be issued to meet the demand for medical marijuana of qualifying patients.

Missouri Regulations 
 DHSSs regulations establish both general requirements applicable to all licensed facilities, as well as specific requirements for various types of licenses, including manufacturing and dispensary licenses. 
 All medical marijuana facilities are required to implement inventory control systems that utilize a DHSS-approved seed-to-sale tracking system for the tracking of marijuana products through the seed or immature plant stage through to sale to a qualified patient (or compliant disposal). Medical marijuana facilities are required to install and maintain security equipment designed to prevent unauthorized entrance, and include components of intrusion detection, electronic video monitoring, access limitation and control, and training of security personnel. Medical marijuana facilities are also required to maintain policies and procedures for addressing recalls, and proper labelling and packaging of products. In general, medical marijuana facilities are not permitted to be operated within 1,000 feet of schools or religious facilities. Wastes from medical marijuana facilities, such as solid wastes and wastewater, must be disposed of in accordance with otherwise-applicable Missouri law regarding waste disposal. Medical marijuana wastes are also required to be rendered unusable by mixture with non-marijuana wastes. 
 Manufacturing facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to develop and maintain an odor mitigation plan, develop a protocol to ensure independent testing of products, plans for minimizing the risk of explosions and fires, and plans to transport medical marijuana to dispensaries in a manner that complies with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities that produce ingestible products are required to comply with all otherwise-applicable food safety standards under Missouri law. 
 Dispensary facilities, in addition to complying with all otherwise-applicable requirements, are required to maintain information accessible to qualified patients regarding such topics as addiction, different strains of medical marijuana and their effects, the risks of medical marijuana use, and prohibitions on consumption of medical marijuana in public places. Dispensary facilities are required to utilize point-of-sale systems that verify a qualified patients purchases through the statewide track and trace system, and that require verification of the qualified patients government-issued identification. A dispensary may not dispense medical marijuana in excess of what the qualified patient is permitted to purchase under the patients physician authorization. Dispensary facilities are required to limit access to qualifying patients and primary caregivers, and to enforce limited access areas throughout the dispensary facility.

The Medical Cannabis Law creates a permitting regime for alternative treatment centers (ATCs), which are vertically-integrated medical marijuana businesses. In addition, the Commissions regulations allow applicants for ATC permits to seek cultivation-, manufacturing-, or dispensing-specific licensure. Holders of an ATC license with a cultivation endorsement can possess, cultivate, plant, grow, harvest, and package usable marijuana; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Holders of an ATC license with a manufacturing endorsement can possess and process usable marijuana; purchase usable marijuana from other ATCs possessing a cultivating endorsement; manufacture products containing marijuana approved by the Commission; conduct research and develop products containing marijuana for approval by the Commission; and can display, transfer, transport, distribute, supply, or sell marijuana and products containing marijuana to other ATCs, but not directly to registered qualifying patients. Finally, holders of an ATC license with a dispensary endorsement can purchase usable marijuana and products containing marijuana from other ATCs authorized to cultivate or manufacture usable marijuana or products containing marijuana; and can possess, display, supply, sell, and dispense, usable marijuana and/or products containing marijuana, to registered qualifying patients. 
 On July 2, 2019, New Jersey enacted the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act that made several changes to the states medical marijuana program. Amongst other changes, the NJ Act: (i) created the Commission, whereas the medical marijuana program was previously regulated by the New Jersey Department of Health, Division of Medicinal Marijuana (DOH); (ii) increases the monthly purchasing limit from two to three ounces of dry flower, and after 18 months allows the maximum to be adjusted by regulation; (iii) removes the purchasing limit for terminally ill and hospice patients; (iv) permits the sale of edible products; (v) phases out sales taxes on medical marijuana; (vi) provides reciprocity for patients registered with other state medical marijuana programs; (vii) authorizes home delivery to patients; and (viii) permitted ATCs to apply for up two additional satellite dispensing facilities, a right which expired as of January 2, 2021. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New Jersey) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New Jersey for the medical marijuana program. 
 On February 22, 2021, the Governor of New Jersey signed into law an adult-use legalization bill entitled the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, which legalized personal use cannabis for certain adults, subject to State regulations (the CREAMM Act). The CREAMM Act provides ATCs specific expanded cultivation rights as well as the right to open up sales to the adult-use marketplace, subject to limited and specified conditions. As it relates to sales into the adult-use marketplace, the CREAMM Act permits ATCs to apply to the Commission for permission to operate as an Expanded ATC, i.e., servicing both the medical and adult-use marketplace, upon the demonstration of meeting the following two conditions:: (1) written approval to operate as an adult-use cannabis establishment from the municipality in which the ATC is located and compliance with said municipalitys local zoning restrictions; and (2) the ATCs certification that it has sufficient quantities of medical cannabis and, if applicable, medical cannabis products, available to meet the reasonably anticipated needs of registered qualifying conditions. The CREAMM Act also permits ATCs to cultivate from up to two physical locations, provided that the ATCs combined mature cannabis plant grow canopy between both locations does not exceed 150,000 square feet of bloom space. 
 On August 19, 2021, the Commission approved the first set of rules governing the states adult-use cannabis program. The rules will allow the CRC to begin licensing cannabis businesses. The rules are effective upon their 
 
75 


  filing with the states Office of Administrative Law, until August 19, 2022.Adult-use sales must commence within 1 year of February 22, 2021, although the CRC has temporarily delayed the process beyond that deadline. On November 23, 2021, the Executive Director of the Commission issued guidance to ATCs on the process for submitting Expanded ATC applications, which the Commission anticipates it will begin accepting for review in December of 2021. Should Columbia Care be awarded an Expanded ATC permit, it would be permitted to cultivate, manufacture, and dispense in the adult-use marketplace. 
 New Jersey Regulations 
 ATC permits are awarded by a selection committee that evaluates applicants on the following general criteria: (1) submittal of mandatory organizational information; (2) ability to meet the overall health needs of qualified patients and safety of the public; (3) history of compliance with regulations and policies governing government-regulated marijuana programs; (4) ability and experience of applicant in ensuring an adequate supply of marijuana; (5) community support and participation; (6) ability to provide appropriate research data; (7) experience in cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing marijuana in compliance with government-regulated marijuana programs; and (8) workforce and job creation plan. Information required to be submitted is wide-ranging, and includes identification information and background checks of principals, employees, directors, and other stakeholders, and evidence of compliance with certain state and local laws and ordinances. Columbia Care was awarded a vertically integrated ATC permit as a result of the result of a 2018 Request for Applications (2018 RFA), along with five (5) other applicants selected for final approval for vertically integrated ATC permits by the DOH. The Commission has since approved an additional fourteen (14) ATC permits as part of the 2019 Request for Applications (2019 RFA), inclusive of four (4) additional vertically integrated permits, and ten (10) stand-alone cultivation permits. 
 New Jersey Licenses 
 

Holding Entity | Permit/License | City | Expiration/RenewalDate (if applicable)(MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Columbia Care New Jersey LLC | Operational Permit #02042020 | Vineland, NJ &Deptford, NJ | 12/31/21 | Cultivation, Processingand Dispensing

 Permits expire annually on December 31 and require the submittal of a renewal application 60-days prior to the expiration of an ATC permit. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations noted against the permit, Columbia Care New Jersey would expect to receive a renewed permit in the ordinary course of business. 
 New Jersey Dispensary Requirements 
 ATCs are subject to a number of regulations regarding their policies, procedures, records, and reporting. For example, ATCs must develop oversight procedures; procedures to ensure safe growing and dispensing operations; security policies; inventory protocols; disaster plans; pricing standards; and crime prevention plans and must maintain careful records, including organizational charts; facility documents; supply-and-demand projections; general business records; detailed sales records; and detailed personnel and training records. ATCs must provide substantial training for their employees and must maintain an alcohol and drug-free workplace. 
 Holders of an ATC permit are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, point-of-sale systems, manufacturing standards, hours of operation, delivery, advertising and marketing, product labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations (N.J.A.C. 8:64 et seq.) should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. 
 
76 


 New Jersey Storage, Security, and Transportation Requirements 
 Each ATC is required to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of marijuana including, when appropriate, systems to protect against electronic records tampering. With respect to security and inventory protocols, ATCs are required to maintain robust security and alarm systems in good working order; test and inspect such security systems; employ policies to limit unauthorized access to areas containing marijuana; adopt security protocols to protect personnel; minimize exterior access and ensure the exterior of the facility has adequate lighting; and notify the proper authorities of reportable losses, security breaches, alarm activations, and electrical failures. ATCs are required to conduct detailed monthly inventories and an annual comprehensive inventory. 
 Each ATC must install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system at its authorized physical address(es) that will provide suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion and that provides, at a minimum: (i) immediate automatic or electronic notification to alert state or local police agencies to an unauthorized breach of security at the alternative treatment center; and (ii) a backup system that activates immediately and automatically upon a loss of electrical support and that immediately issues either automatically or electronic notification to state or local police agencies of the loss of electrical support. ATCs must also implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing marijuana and the theft of marijuana and security measures that protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, registered primary caregivers and principal officers, directors, board members and employees of the alternative treatment center. Each ATC must stablish a protocol for testing and maintenance of the security alarm system and conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at the ATCs authorized location at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection and test, and it must promptly implement all necessary repairs to ensure the proper operation of the alarm system. In the event of a failure of the security alarm system due to a loss of electrical support or mechanical malfunction that is expected to last longer than eight hours, an ATC must notify the Department and either provide alternative security measures or close the affected facilities until service is restored. Finally, each ATC must equip its interior and exterior premises with electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons. 
 Department Inspections 
 ATCs are subject to inspection by the Department at any time, with or without notice. ATCs must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by the Department. Failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide the Department access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. If a problem is discovered, the ATC must notify the Department in writing, with a postmark date that is within 20 business days of the date of the notice of violations, of the corrective actions the ATC has taken to correct the violations and the date of implementation of the corrective actions. 
NEW YORK 
 New York Regulatory Landscape 
 In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act (A06357E, S07923) (the CCA) to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The program allows ten (10) registered organizations (Registered Organizations) to hold vertically integrated licenses and service qualified patients and caregivers. Limited product types are allowed in the state and smoking of cannabis flower is prohibited. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) was the regulatory agency overseeing the medical marijuana program at that time. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of New York) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New York. 
 On March 31, 2021, New York became the 16th state to legalize the adult-use of marijuana with the enactment of Senate Bill S854A, also known as The Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act (the MRTA). Under MRTA, 
 
77 


  the current medical marijuana program is set to undergo several changes. A new Cannabis Control Board, and within it the Office of Cannabis Management (collectively as the CCB)an independent agency operating as part of the New York State Liquor Authoritywill be responsible for regulating the adult-use marijuana market as well as the existing medical marijuana and hemp cannabinoid programs Board. The list of medical conditions covered under the CCA will be widened to include additional qualifying conditions, medical patients will no longer be restricted from smoking medical marijuana, and the current limit on marijuana supply for medical patients will be doubled. Medical marijuana license holders may also be allowed to double their existing number of dispensaries for up to a total of eight dispensaries, but no more than three of the dispensary locations will be permitted to serve as adult-use marijuana retail stores. The legislation takes effect immediately, though full implementation will not occur until the Cannabis Control Board develops regulations for the adult-use marijuana program. It is currently expected that full implementation could take between 18 months to two years. 
 New York Licenses 
 Columbia Care NY LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Care, holds certificates of registration for manufacturing in Rochester, New York, and for dispensing in Riverhead, Brooklyn, New York (City), and Rochester, New York (collectively, the New York Licenses). Pursuant to the CCA and Medical Use of Marihuana Regulations (Title 10, Chapter XIII, Part 1004) by the NYSDOH, the New York Licenses collectively permit Columbia Care NY LLC to acquire, possess, manufacture, sell, transport, distribute, and dispense medical cannabis in the State of New York. The table lists the licenses issued to Columbia Care NY LLC in respect of its operations in New York.

 The New York Licenses are renewed every two years. Before the two-year period ends, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by the NYSDOH. While renewals are granted every two years, there is no ultimate expiry after which no renewals are permitted. Additionally, in respect of the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely 
 
78 


  manner, and there are no material violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care NY LLC would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. 
 New York Regulations 
 The New York Licenses permit the sale of medical cannabis products to any qualified patient who possess a physicians recommendation. Under the terms of the New York Licenses, Columbia Care NY LLC is permitted to sell NYSDOH approved medical marijuana manufactured products to any qualified patient, provided that the patient presents a valid government-issued photo identification and NYSDOH-issued registry identification card proving the patient or designated caregiver meets the statutory conditions to be a qualified patient or designated caregiver. Registry identification cards are valid for one year after the date the certification is signed. The card contains the recommendation from the physician and the limitation on form or dosage of medical marijuana. 
 For a physician to recommend medical marijuana, the physician must pay for and pass a four-hour NYSDOH approved physician certification training program. The content of the course includes: pharmacology of marijuana; contraindications; side effects; adverse reactions; overdose prevention; drug interactions; dosing; routes of administration; risks and benefits; warnings and precautions; abuse and dependence; and such other components as determined by the commissioner. The CCB recently expanded this pool of recommending physicians by identifying that any practitioner who has a license to prescribe controlled substances may certify medical marijuana patients. 
 In order for a patient or registered caregiver to receive dispensed marijuana, they must be logged into the Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) registry. The PMP registry is monitored by the NYSDOH and contains controlled substance prescription dispensing history and medical marijuana dispensing history to ensure that patients only receive a maximum of 30-days-worth of dispensed product from one Registered Organization. Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers. 
 Allowable forms of medical marijuana in New York State are the following: flower, metered liquid or oil preparations, solid and semisolid preparations (e.g. capsules, chewable and effervescent tablets, lozenges), metered ground plant preparations and topical forms and transdermal patches. 
 Medical marijuana may not be incorporated into food products by the Registered Organization, unless approved by the CCB. 
 Qualifying conditions in the state of New York are the following: cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsons disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, Huntingtons disease, certain types of severe debilitating pain, pain that degrades health and functional capability where medical marijuana is used as an opioid alternative, substance use disorder, or post- traumatic stress disorder. The severe debilitating or life-threatening condition must also be accompanied by one or more of the following associated or complicating conditions: cachexia or wasting syndrome, severe or chronic pain resulting in substantial limitation of function, severe nausea, seizures, severe or persistent muscle spasms, post- traumatic stress disorder, or opioid use disorder. 
 In the state of New York, only cannabis that is grown and manufactured in the state can be sold in the state. New York is a vertically integrated system; however, it does allow Registered Organizations to wholesale manufactured product to one another. As such, Columbia Care NY LLC is vertically integrated and has the capabilities to cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell, and dispense cannabis products. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients, however the delivery plan must be pre-approved by the NYSDOH. Columbia Care NY LLC obtained approval for its delivery plan in February 2017 and utilizes its 70% owned subsidiary, CC Logistics Services LLC, to provide home delivery services throughout the state. 
 
79 


 New York Dispensary Requirements 
 A qualified pharmacist must be present at a dispensary whenever medical marijuana products are being dispensed or handled. Dispensing facilities can only sell approved medical marijuana products, related products necessary for the approved forms of administration of medical marijuana, and items that promote health and well-being subject to disapproval of the department and only in such a manner as does not increase risks of diversion, theft or loss of approved medical marijuana products or risk physical, chemical or microbial contamination or deterioration of approved medical marijuana products. 
 No medical marijuana products may be consumed at a dispensary. Dispensaries must maintain patient confidentiality, including by keeping security footage secure. Dispensaries must affix a label to each medical marijuana product which (1) identifies the patient and caregiver (if any); (2) contains the name of the certifying practitioner, (3) identifies the dispensary name, address, and phone number; (4) provides the dosing and administration instructions; (5) gives the quantity and date dispensed; (6) lists any recommendation or limitation by the practitioner as to the use of medical marijuana; and (7) includes the expiration date of the product once opened. Each package must also include a safety insert approved by NYSDOH and/or CCB. 
 New York Reporting Requirements 
 The state of New York has selected BioTrackTHCs solution as the states T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system is required to serve as all Registered Organizations patient verification system but is optional as the Registered Organization facing tracking system. Columbia Care NY LLC currently uses ADILAS Cannabis software as its inventory control system, and also uses BioTrackTHC on a limited basis. ADILAS is a robust system that enables users to track and generate inventory reports on demand with almost unlimited parameters and filters. While certain features of the system are available on the open market, Columbia Cares proprietary modifications have optimized its functionality to respond to the unique requirements of a highly regulated medical marijuana program, such as New Yorks. 
 Every month the NYSDOH requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing the products dispensed for the month. This is the only report Columbia Care NY LLC is required to submit to the NYSDOH. All other data is pulled by the NYSDOH directly from Columbia Care NY LLCs seed-to-sale tracking system. 
 New York Storage, Transportation and Security Requirements 
 Registered Organizations must comply with a range of storage and security measures designed to ensure the safety and security of the cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products. Among other obligations, Registered Organizations are required to maintain a security operations plan that includes: an alarm system; motion detectors; video cameras in areas that may contain marijuana; exportable video recordings that Columbia Care must retain for 90 days and make available to the NYSDOH; measures to ensure adequate lighting; and other security measures. Registered Organizations must work to ensure that manufacturing and dispensing facilities maintain all security system equipment and recordings in a secure location with access limited to surveillance personnel, law enforcement, security system service employees, the NYSDOH or its authorized representative, and others when approved by the NYSDOH. Security equipment must be kept in working order and periodically tested. 
 Marijuana must be stored in a secure area accessible to a minimum number of employees to prevent diversion, theft, loss, and contamination or deterioration of the product. Approved safes, vaults or any other approved equipment or areas used for the manufacturing or storage of marijuana and approved medical marijuana products must be securely locked or protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace marijuana or approved medical marijuana products. 
 Prior to transporting medical marijuana, Registered Organizations must complete a shipping manifest using a form determined by the NYSDOH. A copy of the shipping manifest must be transmitted to the destination that 
 
80 


  will receive the products and to the NYSDOH at least two Business Days prior to transport unless otherwise expressly approved by the NYSDOH. In this regard, the Registered Organization must maintain shipping manifests and make them available to the NYSDOH for inspection upon request, for a period of 5 years. Approved medical marijuana products must be transported in a locked storage compartment that is part of the vehicle transporting the marijuana and in a storage compartment that is not visible from outside the vehicle. Employees, when transporting approved medical marijuana products, travel directly to their destination(s) and may not make unnecessary stops in between. Delivery times must be randomized, transportation vehicles must be staffed by at least two employees, and a copy of the shipping manifest must be on hand while transporting or delivering approved medical marijuana products. 
 NYSDOH Inspections 
 All registered organizations must make their books, records, and facilities available to NYSDOH for monitoring, on- site inspection, and audit purposes, including but not limited to periodic inspections and evaluations. If a problem is found by NYSDOH, the registered organization must submit a plan of correction within 15 days. 
 New York Hemp 
 The CCB also has regulatory authority over New Yorks industrial hemp program. That program creates a licensing regime for growers, processors, retailers, and of industrial hemp and hemp cannabinoid products, and subjects such licensees to recordkeeping, product-quality testing, transportation, disposal, and security requirements. The CCB has authority to inspect a registered premises as often and to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with hemp laws and regulations. 
OHIO 
 Ohio Regulatory Landscape 
 House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (MMCP) allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio- licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana. House Bill 523 required that the framework for the MMCP would be in place no later than September 2018. This timeframe allowed for a deliberate process to ensure the safety of the public and to promote access to a safe product. Sales of medical marijuana in Ohio began in January 2019. 
 The following three state government agencies are responsible for the operation of the MMCP: (i) the Ohio Department of Commerce is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana cultivators, processors and testing laboratories; (ii) the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy is responsible for overseeing medical marijuana retail dispensaries, the registration of medical marijuana patients and caregivers, the approval of new forms of medical marijuana and coordinating the Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee; and (iii) the State Medical Board of Ohio is responsible for certifying physicians to recommend medical marijuana and may add to the list of qualifying conditions for which medical marijuana can be recommended. Qualifying medical conditions for medical marijuana include: HIV/AIDS, Lou Gehrigs disease, Alzheimers disease, Cancer, Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Crohns disease, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, fibromyalgia, glaucoma, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), pain (either chronic, severe, or intractable), Parkinsons disease, PTSD, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord disease or injury, Tourettes syndrome, traumatic brain injury, ulcerative colitis. In order for a patient to be eligible to obtain medical marijuana, a physician must make the diagnosis of one of these conditions. The Board of Pharmacy is in the process of revising its regulations for dispensaries, for the forms and methods for administering medical marijuana, and for patients and caregivers. 
 Several forms of medical marijuana are legal in Ohio, these include: inhalation of marijuana through a vaporizer (not direct smoking), oils, Tinctures, plant material, edibles, patches and any other forms approved by the State 
 
81 


  Board of Pharmacy. On November 18, 2021, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy closed its Request for Applications process to solicit applications for up to 73 new dispensary licenses. It is expected that the Board of Pharmacy will award these new dispensary licenses in early 2022. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Ohio) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Ohio.

Ohio Operating Requirements 
 Cultivators must establish, maintain, and comply with the policies and procedures contained in the operations plans submitted as part of their applications. Operations plans must include policies and procedures for the production, storage, inventory, and transportation of medical marijuana. At a minimum, such plans must: 
 
82 


  (1) designate areas in the facility that are compartmentalized based on function, such as the marijuana cultivation area, with restricted access between the different areas of the facility; (2) implement policies and procedures that provide best practices for secure and proper cultivation of medical marijuana, which includes restricted movement between the different production areas by personnel based on access credentials assigned by the facility; (3) document the chain for all medical marijuana in the inventory tracking system; (4) establish a standard for the facility to be maintained in a clean and orderly condition, which includes free from infestation by rodents, insects, birds, and other animals of any kind; and (5) maintain a facility with adequate lighting, ventilation, temperature, sanitation, equipment and security for the safe and consistent cultivation of medical marijuana. Cultivators must also submit and maintain a quality control plan, and they are limited to the use of pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemical approved by the Department of Commerce. Moreover, cultivators are subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding their use of such chemicals. 
 Cultivators must maintain their facilities according to certain standards. All floors and benches must be free of debris, dust, and any other potential contaminants. Cultivators must remove dead and unusable plant parts from the marijuana cultivation area, and control rodents and other non-plant related pests. In maintaining their facilities, cultivators may only use chemicals, cleaning solutions, and other sanitizing agents approved for use around vegetables, fruit, or medicinal plants and must store them in a manner that protects against contamination. Cultivators must keep their equipment in a clean, professional environment and maintain cleaning and equipment maintenance logs at their facilities. Scales, balances, or other weight and/or mass measuring devices must be routinely calibrated using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable reference weights, at least once each calendar year, by an independent third party approved by the Department of Commerce. The water supply for each cultivation center must be derived from a source that is a regulated water system or a private water supply and must meet the needs of the cultivator. Each cultivator must implement policies and procedures related to receiving, inspecting, transporting, segregating, preparing, packaging, and storing medical marijuana in accordance with adequate sanitation principles. The disposal of undesired, excess, unauthorized, obsolete, adulterated, misbranded or deteriorated medical marijuana waste is subject to a specific set of procedures set forth in OAC 3796:2-2-03.
Cultivators may not sell marijuana to patients or caregivers, nor may they permit the consumption of marijuana on their premises. A cultivator may not grow a prohibited form of marijuana that is not registered and approved by the state of Ohio Board of Pharmacy pursuant to section 3796.061 of the Revised Code. A cultivator must not produce or maintain medical marijuana in excess of the quantity required for normal, efficient operation based on patient population and consumption reported in the inventory tracking system. A cultivator may not amend or otherwise change its approved operations plan, quality assurance plan, or cultivation or production techniques, unless written approval is obtained from the Department of Commerce, and a cultivator may not change the use or occupancy of the facility unless the Department of Commerce is notified of and provides prior written approval of such changes. A cultivator shall not sell plant material that exceeds thirty-five per cent THC content as defined in OAC 3796:1-1-01. Finally, a licensed cultivator may not directly or indirectly discriminate in price between different processor or dispensary facilities that are purchasing a like grade, strain, brand, quality, and quantity of medical marijuana. 
 Ohio Reporting Requirements 
 Ohio uses the METRC system as its seed-to-sale tracking system. Licensees are required to use METRC to push data to the state to meet all of the reporting requirements. When Columbia Care Ohio LLC is operational, it intends to implement its tracking system to comply with the states tracking and reporting requirements. 
Ohio Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 The regulations permit Columbia Care OH LLC to store medical marijuana inventory at its cultivation facility in a designated, enclosed, locked facility identified in its plans and specifications that it submitted to the Ohio Department of Commerce. This storage area can only be accessible by authorized individuals. On an annual basis 
 
83 


  and as a condition to renewal of its cultivator license, Columbia Care OH LLC must perform a physical, manual inventory, of the medical marijuana on hand and compare it to the annual report generated by the inventory tracking system. The cultivation facility must install a commercial grade security alarm system to prevent and detect diversion, theft, or loss. The facility also must maintain surveillance equipment to capture the entire facility and provide direct access to the regulator on a real-time basis. This equipment must be kept in good working order and inspected and tested on an annual basis by a third party. 
 Prior to transporting any medical marijuana, regardless of form, a medical marijuana entity must maintain a transportation log, in writing, that contains the following information: (1) the names and addresses of the medical marijuana entities sending and receiving the shipment; (2) the names and registration numbers of the registered employees transporting the medical marijuana or the products containing medical marijuana; (3) the license plate number and vehicle type that will transport the shipment; (4) the time of departure and estimated time of arrival; (5) the specific delivery route, which includes street names and distances; and (6) the total weight of the shipment and a description of each individual package that is part of the shipment, and the total number of individual packages. A copy of this log must be sent to the receiving entity before the close of business on the business day prior to transport. A copy of the log must also be in the vehicle at all times while it is transporting medical marijuana products. All such logs must be maintained and provided to law enforcement upon request. 
 Vehicles used to transport marijuana must be insured as required by law and staffed with a minimum of two registered employees, with at least one employee remaining with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains medical marijuana. The marijuana must be kept in a locked container or compartment, and it must not be visible from outside the vehicle. The vehicle must be unmarked. Any vehicle transporting medical marijuana or any product containing medical marijuana must travel directly from the sending medical marijuana entity to the receiving medical marijuana entity and shall not make any stops in between except to other medical marijuana entities listed on the transportation log, to refuel the vehicle, or to notify the medical marijuana entities, the department and law enforcement in the event of an emergency. In the event of an emergency, the employees must report the emergency immediately to law enforcement through the 911 emergency system and to the medical marijuana entities, which will immediately notify the appropriate regulatory authorities, unless the notification is impractical under the circumstances. The employees must notify the sending medical marijuana entity when the delivery has been completed. 
 Department of Commerce Inspections 
 The Ohio Department of Commerce may, at any time it determines an inspection is needed, with or without notice, conduct an inspection of a cultivator to ensure compliance with the facilitys application and state laws and regulations. An inspection of a cultivator may include, without limitation, investigation of standards for safety from fire on behalf of the department by the local fire protection agency. If a local fire protection agency is not available, the division of state fire marshal may conduct the inspection after the cultivator pays the appropriate fee to the division of state fire marshal for such inspection. If a problem is detected during an inspection, the cultivator must produce a plan of correction within ten business days. 
PENNSYLVANIA 
 Pennsylvania Regulatory Landscape 
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one of 17 qualifying conditions, including epilepsy, chronic pain, and PTSD. The state, which consists of over 12 million U.S. citizens and qualifies as the fifth largest population in the US, operates as a high- barrier market with very limited market participation. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations). 
 On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would be initiated, which would include the issuance of 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional 
 
84 


  dispensary licenses. This application period ran from April 2018 through May 17, 2018. The Pennsylvania Department of Health announced the results of the application period, granting 23 new dispensary permits and 13 grower/processor permits across six regions of the state, on December 18, 2018. 
 In the introductory months of the program, Pennsylvanias medical marijuana dispensaries experienced supply shortages that rendered the market unable to keep up with demand. It was announced on April 17, 2018 that dry flower would be included in the regulations as an approved product form for sale and consumption (in addition to the already approved forms of concentrates, pills, and tinctures). Simultaneously, it was announced that the list of qualifying conditions would expand from 17 to 21, including additions of cancer remission therapy and opioid-addiction therapy. In July of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Health expanded the list of qualifying medical conditions to include anxiety disorders and Tourette syndrome, increasing the number of qualifying conditions to 23. 
 On March 5, 2021, the Department of Health proposed permanent regulations relating to medical marijuana, replacing the temporary regulations governing the program through its history. These proposed regulations are in substantially the same form as the temporary regulations, with only a few distinctions. One proposed revision identifies that a medical marijuana organizations change in ownership without the Departments knowledge and written approval of all individuals affiliated with the medical marijuana organization would be a violation of the act and proposed rules. The proposed regulations also require dispensaries and grower/processors to supplement ongoing reports to the Department with information related to the average price per unit of medical marijuana products sold, as opposed to the per-dose price. The proposed rules also augment the list of reasons for which the Department may suspend or revoke a medical marijuana organizations permit by adding falsification of information on any applications submitted to the Department. The proposed regulations also address training, identifying that principals, as well as employees, who have direct contact with patients or caregivers or who physically handle medical marijuana plants, seeds and products must also complete a training. 
 Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture administers an Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program, as permitted by the federal Industrial Hemp Research Act of 2016 (P.L. 822, No. 92). As it is allowed to do under the 2018 Farm Bill, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit a regulatory plan to the U.S. Department of Agriculture program to administer a larger Industrial Hemp Program, including licensing the cultivation of hemp, as defined by federal law, for interstate commercial purposes. In January of 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture lifted its 100-acre acreage cap on permitted hemp cultivators to grow unlimited acreage on locations approved under pre-existing permits. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Pennsylvania) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Pennsylvania. 
 Pennsylvania Licenses 
 Under applicable laws, the license permits Columbia Care to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, and to sell marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients pursuant to the terms of the license. The license is issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (the Department) under the provisions of the Medical Marijuana Act (35 P.S. §§ 10231.10110231.2110) and Chapters 1141, 1151 and 1161 of the Pennsylvania regulations. The license is, as of the date hereof, active with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
 All dispensaries must register with the Department. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email and include a renewal form. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material 
 
85 


  violations noted against the applicable license, Columbia Care would expect to receive the applicable renewed license in the ordinary course of business. 
 

Holding Entity | Permit/License | City | Expiration/RenewalDate (if applicable)(MM/DD/YY) | Description 
Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC | Permit D-2009- 17 | Allentown, PAScranton, PAWilkes-Barre, PA | 07/31/22 | Dispensary 
Green Leaf Medicals, LLC | Permit GP-18-3005 | Saxton, PA | 7/31/21 | Grower Processor

Pennsylvania Dispensary Requirements 
 In order to maintain its permit, a dispensary must continue to meet all of the qualifications for obtaining such permit. Dispensaries must purchase marijuana only from authorized growers and processors. They may sell devices related to the use of medical marijuana, but only with the Departments prior written approval. Dispensaries must require a valid identification card from each patient or caregiver and verify it via electronic tracking system before dispensing any product. A dispensary may not dispense (1) a quantity of marijuana greater than the amount indicated on a patients certification, (2) a form or dosage of product that is listed as a restriction or limitation on the patient certification, (3) or a form of medical marijuana product which is not permitted by law or regulation. Dispensaries cannot dispense more than a 30-day supply at one time, and they must wait until the patient has exhausted all but a 7-day supply before providing a refill. Moreover, dispensaries are subject to certain advertising and promotional restrictions. 
 Dispensaries must maintain their facilities in sanitary condition. Generally, employees working in direct contact with medical marijuana products must comply with the food-handling regulations of Pennsylvania. Employees and visitors must have access to adequate hand-washing facilities and sanitary lavatories. 
 Dispensaries may not employ individuals under the age of eighteen. A dispensary may not permit a patient to self- administer medical marijuana products at the facility unless the patient is also an employee of the dispensary, and the dispensary permits self-administration of medical marijuana products at the facility by the employees. 
 Pennsylvania Reporting Requirements 
 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uses MJ Freeway as the states computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees are required to use MJ Freeway to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC integrates its in-house software with the states MJ Freeway program to capture the data points required by the Pennsylvania medical marijuana laws and regulations. 
 Pennsylvania Storage, Transportation, and Security Requirements 
 The regulations require a dispensary to have a locked limited access area for the storage of medical marijuana that is expired, damaged, deteriorated, mislabeled, contaminated, recalled or whose containers or packages have been opened or breached until such product is returned to the grower/processor. 
 Columbia Care Pennsylvania LLC must have a security system with professional monitoring, 24-hours a day and seven days a week, and fixed cameras on the interior and exterior of the facilities. The surveillance system must store data for a period of four years in a readily available format for investigative purposes. 
 Unless otherwise approved by the Department, a dispensary may deliver medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization only between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. for the purposes of transporting medical marijuana 
 
86 


  products among the permittees dispensary locations and returning medical marijuana products to a grower/processor. Dispensaries may not transport medical marijuana products outside of Pennsylvania, and they must use a global positioning system to ensure safe, efficient delivery of the medical marijuana products to a medical marijuana organization. Dispensaries may not offer delivery of medical marijuana. Dispensaries must have an enclosed, secure area out of public sight for the loading and unloading of medical marijuana products into and from a transport vehicle. 
 All vehicles used in the transport of marijuana must be unmarked and equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area. Products must be appropriately packaged and labeled. If transporting perishable medical marijuana products, they must be temperature controlled. They must display current inspection stickers and be insured for a commercially reasonable amount. Each vehicle must be staffed with at least two people while transporting marijuana, with at least one team member remaining in the vehicle at all times. Each team member must have access to a secure form of communication with the dispensary and have a valid drivers license. Team members must not wear clothing or symbols related to marijuana, and they must carry an identification badge or card at all times and produce it to law enforcement upon request. The team must also carry a transportation manifest and provide a copy to the recipient of the medical marijuana products. 
 Department Inspections 
 The Department may conduct announced or unannounced inspections or investigations to determine the medical marijuana organizations compliance with its permit and all relevant laws and regulations. Such inspection or investigation may include (1) inspection of a medical marijuana organizations site, facility, vehicles, books, records, papers, documents, data, and other physical or electronic information; (2) questioning of employees, principals, operators, financial backers, authorized agents of, and any other person or entity providing services to the medical marijuana organization; and (3) inspection of a grower/processor facilitys equipment, instruments, tools and machinery that are used to grow, process and package medical marijuana, including containers and labels. Failure to provide immediate access to any of the materials, information, or individuals listed above may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty, suspension or revocation of the medical marijuana organizations permit, or an immediate cessation of its operations pursuant to a cease-and-desist order issued by the Department. 
 PUERTO RICO 
 Puerto Rico Regulatory Landscape 
 Puerto Ricos medical marijuana program is governed by the Medical Cannabis Act, 24 L.P.R.A. § 2621 et seq. (the PR Act), and by regulations promulgated by the Medical Cannabis Regulatory Board (the MCR Board), Regulation No. 9038, July 2, 2018. The program allows for the medical administration of cannabis in private locations when the use is recommended by an authorized physician. Smoking medical marijuana, which does not include vaporizing, remains prohibited. The MCR Board has authorized physicians to prescribe medical cannabis for a bona fide medical condition not otherwise prohibited by the regulations or the PR Act, as determined by a physician, provided that patients who are prescribed medical marijuana must register with the MCR Board and provide a MCR Board-issued identification to obtain medical marijuana. 
 The Medical Cannabis Act authorizes the MCR Board to create licensing regimes for  among other entities  cultivation centers, dispensaries, and manufacturing facilities. Licensees of separate types of licenses are only permitted to engage in the specific licensing activity for which they are granted a license. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in Puerto Rico) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by Puerto Rico.

 | Specific and detailed requirements on the marking of exits and entrances to and from a limited access area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With regard to transportation, all transportation of marijuana must be accompanied by a manifest approved by the Department of Health with specific information, including the name of the registered distributing entity, the name of the registered establishment receiving the product, a description of the route taken, and the name of the vehicle driver. Each manifest must be maintained for two years. Only those licensed by the division may be authorized to transport product. Vehicles used for transportation must be duly licensed under Puerto Rican motor vehicle law. 
 With regard to storage, marijuana may only be stored by a licensee in a licensed establishment, or in an otherwise approved location (and such approved location may only be used for the storage of marijuana). A license holder may only store marijuana that belongs to the license holders inventory. 
 Puerto Rico Department Inspections 
 All facilities subject to license are subject to inspection, as are all required documents. Inspectors have the right pursuant to an order of an inspection to inspect facilities and documents upon announcement and provision of proper identification to the license holder, under the limitations of an inspection order and using reasonable means. Inspectors are permitted to take chemical samples and inventory lists. Inspectors are not permitted to inspect financial or price information. 
UTAH 
 Utah Regulatory Landscape 
 On December 3, 2018, Utah lawmakers passed House Bill 3001: Utah Medical Cannabis Act (the UT Act). The Utah Act directs the Utah Department of Health (the Utah Department) to issue medical cannabis cards to patients, register medical providers who wish to recommend medical cannabis treatment for their patients, and license medical cannabis pharmacies. Covered medical conditions include HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, cachexia, persistent nausea, Chrons disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, PTSD that is being treated and monitored by a 
 
89 


  licensed therapist, autism, certain terminal illnesses, and certain other rare conditions and diseases. The Act and subsequent amendments thereto authorized the Department to license and regulate up to 14 private entities to dispense medical cannabis products through medical cannabis pharmacies. The Utah Department has issued regulations governing medical cannabis pharmacies operations. The UT Act also grants the Department of Agriculture and Food regulatory authority over medical marijuana cultivators and processors. Effective July 1, 2021, all Utah medical cannabis cardholders are required to purchase their products from a Utah medical cannabis pharmacy. Out of state purchases and possession of medical cannabis are no longer permitted. 
 On January 3, 2020, the Department announced its intent to award 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses to companies selected from over 130 applicants. Columbia Care was selected to open a medical cannabis pharmacy in Springville, Utah, which is located just south of Provo. Columbia Care (through its subsidiary in the State of Utah) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Utah. Additionally, Utah law required the 15th pharmacy license to be given to a business located in specific rural counties. On November 18, 2021, the Department awarded the states 15th medical cannabis pharmacy license to an existing Utah medical cannabis pharmacy operator that will open its facility in Price, Utah. 
 Additionally, in 2014, the Utah legislature passed the Hemp and Cannabinoid Act (the UT Hemp Act) pursuant to the 2014 Farm Bill, which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in Utah. The UT Hemp Act created a pilot program for hemp. Utahs 2019 amendments to the UT Hemp Act expanded the scope of the states hemp program. In 2020, Utah amended the UT Hemp Act once again and directed the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) to develop a state industrial hemp production plan. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the Utah Industrial Hemp Production Plan. 
 Under the UT Hemp Act, an individual or entity cultivating or processing industrial hemp must obtain an industrial hemp producer license. The industrial hemp production plan subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include grower area requirements and reporting requirements; submission to inspection, sampling, and testing by UDAF to ensure the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; storage requirements; and destruction processes. Intentional violations of the UT Hemp Act or UDAFs rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in loss of license. 
 Utah License Requirements 
 The Department announced its plans to award the 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses across four regions of the state. Columbia Care applied for a license in Region 3, which encompasses Utah County, where Springville is situated. The application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, and a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, operating plan, strategic plan, local connections, and ability to keep the cost of medical cannabis low for patients. Such information included, for example: a list of all states in which Columbia Care operates; details of Columbia Cares proposed facility; a floor plan depicting the facilitys security features; information about principles and key employees credentials, including a Utah licensed pharmacist; training and customer service information; storage protocols; a description of all medical cannabis products Columbia Care intends to offer; a financial plan; and Columbia Cares local connections to Utah. 
 License applications were then evaluated and scored by a committee based on several criteria, including: experience in the medical cannabis or other highly regulated industries, disciplinary action or investigation in other jurisdictions, an operating plan that will best ensure the safety and security of cardholders and the community, the extent to which an applicant can reduce the cost of medical cannabis, connections to the local community, and a strategic plan that has a high likelihood of success. Of the 14 licenses awarded by the Department, an initial group of eight pharmacies were given the option to open as soon as March 1, 2020, while the remaining six are allowed to open as early as July 1, 2020. Successful applicants were required to obtain a land-use permit for their medical cannabis pharmacy within 120 days of the license award if required by their 
 
90 


  county or locality. Final licensure is also subject to applicants owners passing criminal background checks and the Department approval of the applicants operating plans. Columbia Care satisfied these requirements and was issued a medical cannabis pharmacy license on April 22, 2021 authorizing Columbia Care to operate the pharmacy. 
 UDAF licenses medical cannabis processors and regulates the manufacturing and processing of medical cannabis into various medical cannabis products. Processors in Utah are responsible for dry, cure, extraction, refinement, formulation, packaging, and labeling of medical cannabis products. Utah has two tiers of processing licenses. A Tier 1 Processing License allows a facility to process, formulate, package, and label products. A Tier 2 License allows a facility to packaging and labeling or products. Currently UDAF is not restricting the number of either tier of processing licenses. 
 Columbia Care applied for a Tier 1 processing license. The processing license application process required Columbia Care to pay an application fee and to submit information regarding its ownership and directors, its finances, a description of any past disciplinary actions for cannabis-related operations in any jurisdiction and detailed property information, including, but not limited to facility square footage, type and location of equipment, and the location of all cameras and external lights. Columbia Care was also required to submit highly detailed information regarding its experience, and operating plan, Such information included, for example: a list of all products that will be produced; all extraction methods to be used, including solvents, chemicals and equipment; short and long-term storage protocols to ensure sanitary preservation of medical cannabis products; a recall plan; a disposal plan; and transportation and transfer plan, including the make and model of all vehicles Columbia Care will use to transport medical cannabis products. All Medical Cannabis Processing Facilities must comply with quality assurance testing, and obtain a Good Manufacturing Permit from UDAFs Regulatory Services. Final licensure is also subject to the payment of a $100,000.00 processing fee, securing a $50,000.00 performance bond, and successful completion of a pre-inspection to verify the processing facility meets all safety and security requirements. Columbia Care expects to satisfy these requirements in the ordinary course of business. 
 Utah Operating Requirements 
 Medical cannabis pharmacies in Utah are subject to several highly detailed operational requirements. The requirements impose restrictions on who may enter a pharmacy, who may be employed by a pharmacy, and on consuming cannabis on site. They require pharmacies to maintain sophisticated security infrastructure and policies designed to minimize the risk of diversion and to minimize access to cannabis products. These include, for example, maintenance of a physical surveillance system with video cameras located throughout the facility, a fail-safe backup system to support the system in the event of a power-outage; installation of an alarm system; and maintenance of safes and vaults for storing medical cannabis. 
 The operational requirements also govern the dispensing procedure. All cannabis sold must meet certain labeling requirements and transactions are subject to a number of verification, inventory, and record-keeping requirements. Unusable cannabis products must be properly disposed. The UT Act imposes limitations on the amount of cannabis a pharmacy can dispense to a single patient in a 28-day period. That amount is capped at the lesser of (a) a 30-day supply for treatment; (b) 113 grams of unprocessed cannabis; or (c) 20 grams of total composite THC. Utah law also allows pharmacies to dispense medical cannabis via home delivery. 
 Medical cannabis pharmacies are required to employ a pharmacist-in-charge (PIC). The duties of the PIC generally include ensuring: the safe, informed, and appropriate distribution of medical cannabis and cannabis devices; protection, recording, and maintenance of patient records; education and training of pharmacy personnel; procurement of cannabis products and educational materials; appropriate disposal and storage of cannabis; controls against theft or diversion; compliance with applicable laws and regulations; quality assurance; maintenance of the point-of-sale system and integration with the states inventory systems; and safe operation of the facility. Pharmacies must also be supervised by at least one licensed medical cannabis pharmacy medical provider (PMP) who must be present during all hours of operation.

 On January 3, 2020, the Department announced its intent to award 14 medical cannabis pharmacy licenses to companies selected from over 130 applicants. Columbia Care was selected to open a medical cannabis pharmacy in Springville, Utah and on April 22, 2021 was issued a Cannabis Pharmacy License authorizing Columbia Care to operate the cannabis pharmacy. Licenses must be renewed annually. While Columbia Cares compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material deviations from Department requirements, there is no assurance that the license will be annually renewed. 
 Additionally, effective June 7, 2021, Columbia Care entered into a Cannabis Processor Licensing Agreement with the UDAF. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, Columbia Care may be issued a Tier I Cannabis Processing License by UDAF for a facility located in Centerville, Utah. Issuance of the license is contingent on the completion of facility improvements and related inspections, obtaining a Good Manufacturing Permit from UDAF, payment of a $100,000.00 processing fee, securing a $50,000.00 performance bond, and successful completion of a pre-inspection prior to June 7, 2022. Once issued, the license must be renewed annually. Columbia Care has filed for building permits and expects to receive a final license in the ordinary course of business; however, while Columbia Cares compliance controls have been developed to mitigate the risk of any material deviations from an application requirement as specified in the licensing agreement, there is no assurance that the license will ultimately be granted and annually renewed thereafter. 
 Utah Inspections 
 Columbia Cares Utah facility and records are subject to inspection from the Department at any time during business hours. 
 2020 Amendments to the UT Act 
 On February 28, 2020, the Governor signed legislation comprehensively amending the UT Act. Among the changes were the allowance of dosages in liquid suspension, allowance of medical cannabis pharmacies to sell certain CBD products, creation of partial-year limited licenses for cannabis processing licensing facilities and operation of an independent testing laboratory by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF), expansion of the authority of the states Cannabinoid Product Board to review scientific research on the efficacy of products, and the states Compassionate Use Board to hear petitions for use, relaxation of certain patient limits on use and validity of medical cannabis cards and restrictions on medical providers, direction to the Department of Health to authorize out-of-state residents to purchase medical cannabis, and permission to the UDAF to conduct random sampling of medical cannabis in medical cannabis pharmacies. 
 VIRGINIA 
 Virginia Regulatory Landscape 
 In 2017, Virginia commenced a program to allow registered patients to use CBD oil or THC-A oil. The program is governed by Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-3442.5 et seq., and by emergency regulations enacted by the Virginia 
 
92 


  Board of Pharmacy (the Virginia Board) at 18 VAC 110-60-10 et seq. Registered patients means any Virginia resident who has received a written certification for the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil from a practitioner (which includes nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to alleviate the symptoms of any diagnosed condition or disease, and who has been issued a registration by the Virginia Board. Virginias program allows the Virginia Board to license pharmaceutical processors, which are vertically integrated operations that can cultivate, process, and dispense CBD oil and THC-A oil in concentrations to be established by the Virginia Board that cannot exceed 10 mg of THC per dose. The oils can be processed into other formulations, such as capsules or lozenges. The state has limited licensure to one pharmaceutical process per health service area, as defined by the State Board of Health. There are currently five health service areas. Following an initial cultivation period, pharmaceutical processors cannot maintain more than 12 cannabis plants per patient and cannot maintain CBD oil or THC-A oil in excess of what is required for normal operations. 
 In 2020, Virginia passed an act amending and reenacting Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-408.3 and 54.1-3442.5 et. seq (the Amendment). The Amendment allows for cannabis dispensing facilities, allows patients who are temporary residents to register, permits access to cultivation areas of the processor without a pharmacist on site, permits the Board to establish standards for testing laboratories to obtain controlled substance registration, permits the sale of devices and inert sample products, allows wholesale distribution between processors and dispensing facilities, changes every reference of cannabidiol oil or THC-A oil to cannabis oil, deletes the requirement for an in-person examination by the prescriber certifying a patient to receive cannabis oil and allow the use of telemedicine in compliance with federal law, allows the pharmacist-in-charge to authorize certain employees to access secured areas when a pharmacist is not on site, and allows a ratio of six pharmacy technicians per one pharmacist working in the processor. 
 In 2020, the Virginia Board amended Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq. and in February 2021, the Virginia Board adopted emergency rules amending Title 18 of the Virginia Administrative Code 110-60, et. seq. effective February 8, 2021 through August 7, 2022. These rules and emergency rules implement the changes as laid out in the Amendment. Cannabis dispensing facility means a facility that (i) has obtained a permit from the Board pursuant to § 54.1-3442.6; (ii) is owned, at least in part, by a pharmaceutical processor; and (iii) dispenses cannabis oil produced by a pharmaceutical processor to a registered patient, his registered agent, or, if such patient is a minor or an incapacitated adult as defined in § 18.2-369, such patients parent or legal guardian. Temporarily resides means a person that does not maintain a principal place of residence within Virginia but resides in Virginia on a temporary basis as evidenced by documentation substantiating such temporary residence. 
 On April 7, 2021, a majority of both houses of the Virginia legislature voted to legalize adult-use marijuana. Virginia Senate Bill 1406/House Bill 2312 legalizes the retail sale of marijuana products to adults over the age of 21 and establishes the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority to oversee the cultivation, manufacture, wholesale, and retail sale of marijuana and marijuana products. Under the new law, home cultivation and personal possession of marijuana became legal July 1, 2021, but retail sales will not begin until January 1, 2024. 
 Columbia Care (through its subsidiaries in the Commonwealth of Virginia) is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
 Virginia License Requirements 
 The pharmaceutical processor permit application process includes three stages: initial application, awarding of conditional approval, and granting of a permit. In the first stage, the applicant must submit an application fee and an application that includes: identifying information regarding the applicant and its owners; the location within the health service area that is to be operated under such permit; financial information to demonstrate its capacity to build and operate a facility; a detailed security plan; documents establishing the applicants ability to conduct business in Virginia and its compliance with applicable ordinances and codes; information necessary for the Virginia Board to conduct criminal background checks; information about any previous or current involvement 
 
93 


  in the medical CBD oil or THC-A oil industry; information about any prior applications for medical CBD oil or THC-A oil licensure in any state; business or marketing plans; text and graphic materials showing the exterior appearance of the proposed facility; building documents including a detailed blueprint; documents related to any compassionate need program the pharmaceutical processor intends to offer; information about the applicants expertise in agriculture and other production techniques required to produce CBD oil or THC-A oil and to safely dispense such products; and other documents required by the Virginia Board. As part of the initial application process, the Virginia Board conducts criminal background checks on applicants. 
 Following the deadline for receipt of applications, the Virginia Board evaluates each complete and timely submitted application and may grant conditional approval based on the following criteria: the results of the criminal background checks or any history of disciplinary action imposed by a state or federal regulatory agency; the location for the proposed pharmaceutical processor, which shall not be within 1,000 feet of a school or daycare; the applicants ability to maintain adequate control against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis; the applicants ability to maintain the knowledge, understanding, judgment, procedures, security controls, and ethics to ensure optimal safety and accuracy in the dispensing and sale of CBD oil or THC-A oil; the extent to which the applicant or any of its the applicants pharmaceutical processor owners have a financial interest in another license, permit, registrant, or applicant; and any other reason provided by state or federal statute or regulation that is not inconsistent with the law and regulations regarding pharmaceutical processors. The Virginia Board may disqualify any applicant who submits an incomplete, false, inaccurate, or misleading application; fails to submit an application by the published deadline; fails to pay all applicable fees; or fails to comply with all requirements for a pharmaceutical processor. 
 Following review, the Virginia Board notifies applicants of denial or conditional approval. If granted conditional approval, an applicant has one year to complete all requirements for issuance of a permit to include employment of a Pharmacist-in-Charge (PIC) and other personnel necessary for operation of a pharmaceutical processor, the construction or remodeling of a facility, installation of equipment, and securing local zoning approval. 
 When the Virginia Boards requirements have been met  including designation of a PIC, completion of background checks, employment of an electronic tracking system, and an inspection of the facility  the Virginia Board may grant a pharmaceutical processor permit. If an inspection reveals any deficiencies, they must be corrected, and a reinspection may be performed before the permit is issued. The applicant must also attest to compliance with state and local laws and ordinances. 
 If an applicant has been awarded a pharmaceutical processor permit and has not commenced operation of such facility within 180 days of being notified of the issuance of a pharmaceutical processor permit, the Virginia Board may rescind the permit, unless such delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder. If a permit is so rescinded, the Virginia Board may award a pharmaceutical processor permit to another qualified applicant. Once the permit is issued, cannabis may not be grown or held in the pharmaceutical processor earlier than two weeks prior to the opening date designated on the application. Once cannabis has been placed in the pharmaceutical processor, a pharmacist shall be present during hours of operation to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of the cannabis. If there is a change in the designated opening date, the pharmaceutical processor shall notify the Virginia Board, and a pharmacist shall continue to be on site on a daily basis. 
 The Virginia Board may issue up to five cannabis dispensing facility permits in each health service area. A permit may be issued to a facility that is owned, at least in part, by the pharmaceutical processor located in that health service area for dispensing cannabis oil that has been cultivated and produced on the premises of the processor. Each dispensing facility shall be located within the same health service area as the pharmaceutical processor. 
 Applicants must submit an application and fee for each cannabis dispensing facility. The submission must also include (i) the name and address of the facility, (ii) the name and address of the facilitys owners with 5% or 
 
94 


  greater ownership, (iii) the name and signature of pharmacist-in-charge, (iv) details regarding the security plan and plan to prevent diversion, (v) information for the Virginia Board to conduct a background check, and (vi) the requisite fee. 
 The Virginia Board will conduct an inspection of the facility prior to issuing a permit. The permit shall not be awarded until any deficiency with the facility has been corrected and the facility has been satisfactorily inspected. The cannabis dispensing facility must be operational within 90 days of the date the permit is issued or the Virginia Board will either rescind or extend the permit. 
 Virginia Operating Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are required to designate a PIC to manage its operation, and to have a supervising pharmacist on duty during its hours of operation. The PIC of a pharmaceutical processor may authorize certain employees access to secured areas designated for cultivation even when the pharmacist is not on the premises. Numerous tasks involving the handling of CBD oil or THC-A oil must be performed by a pharmacist or a pharmacy technician acting under a pharmacists supervision. Those tasks include, for example, labeling oils, removing oils from inventory, measuring oils for dispensing, and selling oils. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians must have current licenses, and the ratio of pharmacists to pharmacy technicians cannot exceed 4-to-1. The Virginia Board has also imposed certain educational requirements for the cultivation of cannabis plants and the extraction of oils. And, the Virginia Board requires significant employee training, both upon initial employment and continuously thereafter. 
 A pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must operate for a minimum of 35 hours per week. Access to a pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility is limited to employees performing their job duties (who must display ID badges) and patients (and their parents or guardians). It must sell oils in a child-resistant container (with some exceptions). Pharmacists must counsel registered patients, parents, and legal guardians regarding the use of CBD oil or THC-A oil, including information related proper use and storage. 
 Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are subject to advertising restrictions; cannot sell products aside from CBD oil or THC-A oil; cannot cultivate, produce, or dispense oils anywhere except its designated facility; and cannot provide samples. Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities may wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and may transport wholesale products to other pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities. A pharmaceutical processor wholesale distributing products must create a record of the transaction and provide the receiver of the products with a copy of the lab results for the product. They may also deliver CBD or THC-A oil to a registered patient in accordance with certain regulatory requirements. 
 The cultivation and dispensing processes are subject to numerous Virginia Board requirements. For cultivation: pesticides are prohibited (with some exception); oil extraction methods must meet industry standards; products must be branded, tested, and registered with the Virginia Board before they are dispensed; products must be labeled to disclose certain product identifying information; and samples from batches must be made available to independent laboratories for testing prior to sale. For dispensing: the pharmacist or pharmacy technician must view the patients ID before filling any portion of the patients prescription; the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must maintain detailed dispensing records for three years; and the processor or dispensing must implement and comply with a quality assurance program, meeting several requirements, to prevent dispensing errors. Finally, unused cannabis and its oils must be disposed of in a manner that makes the cannabis and its oils unrecoverable. 
 As of September 2021, the Board allows pharmaceutical processors to sell whole flower to patients. 
 Virginia Licenses 
 On September 25, 2018, the Virginia Board announced the conditional approval of pharmaceutical processor permits for each of Virginias five health service areas. Columbia Care Eastern Virginia LLC was awarded 
 
95 


  conditional approval for Health Services Area V and was granted a final permit to operate a facility in that area on April 6, 2020.

 Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities are subject to a number of inventory and security requirements. They must conduct an initial comprehensive inventory; establish ongoing inventory controls and procedures; conduct the requisite inventory reviewed (weekly inventory reviews for pharmaceutical processors and perpetual inventory for cannabis dispensing facilities); and prepare an annual inventory report. Inventory records must be made available to the Virginia Board and its agents. All parts of the cannabis plant and its oils must be stored in a locked and secured vault or safe with appropriate access limitations, and the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must maintain a sophisticated security system meeting certain Virginia Board criteria. Storage of cannabis and its oils must generally be clean, sanitary, safe, and subject to a number of conditions. The pharmaceutical processors or cannabis dispensing facilitys video system must cover areas where cannabis or its oils are handled. Recordings must be stored for 30 days and made available for the Virginia Boards immediate review upon request. Security events must be reported to the Virginia Board. Pharmaceutical processors and cannabis dispensing facilities may not transport cannabis or its oils to any other facility, except for the wholesale purposes specified above. 
Virginia Board Inspections 
 At all times, pharmacists and pharmacy technicians at the pharmaceutical processor or cannabis dispensing facility must have their current license or registration available for inspection by the Virginia Board or its agents. 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
 Washington, D.C. Regulatory Landscape 
 Washington, D.C.s medical marijuana program is governed by D.C. Code § 7-1671.01 et seq. and the Department of Healths implementing regulations, CDCR 22-C100 et seq. The program authorizes patients with a qualifying medical or dental condition to use marijuana via inhalation, ingestion, or other means. Qualifying medical conditions include chemotherapy, the use of azidothymidine or protease inhibitors, radiotherapy, or any other treatment, as determined by rulemaking, whose side effects require treatment through the administration of medical marijuana in the same manner as a qualifying medical or dental condition. The program also authorizes patients from other states to purchase medical marijuana in Washington, D.C. An emergency rulemaking action from the Mayors Office expanded the number of states whose medical cards the program will accept to include any state or U.S. territory that has an active medical marijuana program and issues either a card or state-issued document evidencing the patients participation in the program. An emergency rulemaking action by the Council 
 
96 


  of the District of Columbia on November 2, 2021, provided for the issuance of two-year registrations cards to qualifying patients and caregiver for the purpose of attracting and keeping qualified patients and their caregivers in the legal medical cannabis market. 
 The medical marijuana program creates licensing regimes for dispensaries and cultivation centers. A dispensary registered to operate in the District of Columbia may (a) possess and sell medical marijuana to registered qualified patients and caregivers; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered qualified patients and caregivers. A cultivation center registered to operate in the District of Columbia may: (a) possess, manufacture, grow, cultivate, and distribute medical marijuana for sale to registered dispensaries; and (b) manufacture, purchase, possess, and distribute paraphernalia and cigarette rolling papers to registered dispensaries. The number of dispensaries in the District of Columbia is capped at 7, with discretion for the mayor to increase the number to 8, while the number of cultivation centers is capped at 10. Currently, there are seven dispensaries and eight cultivation centers. There are also pending application processes for an additional dispensary license, two additional cultivation centers, and two testing laboratories. Columbia Care submitted a letter of intent to apply the additional dispensary license and was approved. The application period runs from starts at Monday, November 29, 2021, through Monday, March 28, 2022.

 WEST VIRGINIA (HEMP) 
 In 2002, the West Virginia Legislature passed the Industrial Hemp Development Act (the WV Hemp Act), which created the framework for legalized industrial hemp in West Virginia. Following passage of the 2014 Farm Bill, which authorized states to establish pilot programs for industrial hemp research, the West Virginia Department of Agriculture implemented a pilot program based on the authority already granted by the WV Hemp Act. From 2017 to 2019, the number of license-holders under the pilot program increased from 46 to 165. West Virginias 2019 amendments to the WV Hemp Act authorized the Commissioner of Agriculture to submit a state plan for regulation of industrial hemp to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. The West Virginia Department of Agriculture submitted such a plan on January 23, 2020, with a proposed effective date of October 31, 2020. The plan proposed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is consistent with the West Virginia Department of Agricultures existing industrial hemp program. 
 The industry hemp program subjects licensees to several regulatory requirements. These include crop-testing requirements to determine whether the hemp has a permissible THC level of under 0.3%; recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and submission to any inspection and sampling that the West Virginia Department of Agriculture deems necessary. Intentional violations of the WV Hemp Act and the West Virginia Department of Agricultures rules, as well as repeated negligent violations, may result in a loss of license.

 WEST VIRGINIA 
 Regulatory Landscape 
 Senate Bill 386, signed into law on April 19, 2017, by Governor Jim Justice, created the Medical Cannabis Act that allows for cannabis to be used for certified medical use by a West Virginia resident with a serious medical condition and is limited to the following forms: pill; oil; topical forms including gels, creams or ointments; a form medically appropriate for administration by vaporization or nebulization, dry leaf or plant form; tincture; liquid; or dermal patch. The medical cannabis program is administered by the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health, Office of Medical Cannabis (the WV Bureau). The Office has authority to (1) issue and oversee permits that authorize businesses to grow, process, or dispense medical cannabis in compliance with state law and regulations, (2) register medical practitioners who certify patients as having qualifying serious medical conditions, and (3) register and oversee patients with qualifying conditions. Medical cannabis may only be dispensed to a patient who receives a certification from a practitioner and is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the WV Bureau ; and a caregiver who is in possession of a valid identification card issued by the Bureau. Products packaged by a grower/processor or sold by a dispensary shall only be identified by the name of the grower/processor, the name of the dispensary, the form and species of medical cannabis, the percentage of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol contained in the product. 
 
99 


 A dispensary that has been issued a permit may lawfully dispense medical cannabis to a patient or caregiver upon presentation to the dispensary of a valid identification card for that patient or caregiver. The dispensary shall provide to the patient or caregiver a receipt, as appropriate. The receipt shall include all of the following: the name, address, and any identification number assigned to the dispensary by the WV Bureau; the name and address of the patient and caregiver; the date the medical cannabis was dispensed; any requirement or limitation by the practitioner as to the form of medical cannabis for the patient; and the form and the quantity of medical cannabis dispensed. Dispensaries are prohibited from dispensing cannabis products to anyone other than a registered patient or caregiver who presents a valid identification card from the Office. Dispensing amounts are limited to those indicated in a registered patients certification by his/her medical practitioner, and in any event a dispensary may not dispense more than a 30-day supply at a given time. 
 The WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue must monitor the price of medical cannabis sold by growers, processors and by dispensaries, including a per-dose price. If the WV Bureau and the Department of Revenue determine that the prices are unreasonable or excessive, the WV Bureau may implement a cap on the price of medical cannabis being sold for a period of six months. 
 The WV Bureaus Office of Medical Cannabis (the WV Office) received applications for medical cannabis growers, processors, dispensaries, and laboratories in Spring 2020. The Office of Medical Cannabis issued 10 grower permits on October 3, 2020. It issued 10 processor permits on November 13, 2020. It issued 100 dispensary permits on January 29, 2021, and announced that, beginning February 3, 2021, West Virginia residents with serious medical conditions would be able to begin to submit applications to become registered patients. 
 Permits issued by the Office of Medical Cannabis are effective for one year from the date of issuance and may be renewed by applicants in good standing with the terms of a currently-effective permit. Permits may be suspended or revoked on the basis of failure to prevent diversion of medical cannabis, or violation of laws and rules applicable to medical cannabis businesses.

 EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
 The following sections describe the legal and regulatory landscape in the European Union , the United Kingdom, and the EU member states, in particular Germany, in which Columbia Care operates or is exploring business opportunities. 
 While Columbia Care works to ensure that its operations comply with applicable EU, UK, and EU member state laws, regulations, and licensing requirements, for the reasons described above and the risks further described under the heading Risk Factors, there are significant risks associated with the business of Columbia Care. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read and consider all of the risk factors contained under the heading Risk Factors below. 
 Except as described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Columbia Care is in compliance with applicable law and has not received any citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Columbia Cares licenses, business activities or operations. 
 Medical Cannabis 
 In the absence of a clear EU definition of medical cannabis, from a legal and regulatory perspective, a distinction should be made between: 
 

 | Cannabis-derived medicinal products: these are products which have obtained a marketing authorization from a regulatory authority (the European Medicines Agency at EU level or national competent authorities at EU member state level), after going through extensive clinical trials to test the products safety and effectiveness. These products are regulated as (cannabis-derived) medicinal products in accordance with the harmonized EU regulatory system set forth by EU Directive 2001/83/EC. To date, several cannabinoid-containing medicinal products have been authorized for marketing in the EU and certain EU member states; some are plant-based, i.e., Sativex® (nabiximols) and Epidyolex® (CBD); others are synthetic, i.e., Marinol® (dronabinol) and Cesamet® (nabilone).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cannabis preparations for medical use: these are products which have not obtained a marketing authorization but are authorized through national distribution and use authorizations/licenses in certain EU member states. This may include raw cannabis, such as the flowering tops, compressed resin or hash, oils extracted from the plant, etc. Alternatively, raw cannabis can be transformed by a pharmacist into a magistral preparation in accordance with a medical prescription, or the raw cannabis may already have been transformed by the manufacturer into standardized cannabis preparations. These cannabis preparations can vary greatly in composition, depending for example on the strain of cannabis, the growing conditions and how the preparations are stored.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K focuses only on such cannabis preparations for medical use, referred to as medical cannabis. Medical cannabis can be described as whole-plant cannabis-derived products (generally cannabis flower or oils) that are licensed by member state health systems for prescription by a doctor. As recognized by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (the EMCDDA), medical cannabis refers to a wide variety of preparations and products that may contain different active ingredients and use different routes of administration. 
 EU Regulatory Landscape 
 As the EU is not a party to the international conventions related to the control of drugs, the obligation to implement the provisions of said conventions sits with the individual EU member states. However, the EU has observer status in the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND). 
 Also, from an EU perspective, the regulation of medical cannabis falls largely within the competence of the EU member states, which may decide to permit the medical use of cannabis preparations  without requiring a marketing authorization in accordance with EU Directive 2001/83/EC  under specific conditions. In this respect, Article 5(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, which relates to so-called named patient use of medicinal products, states: 
 a member state may, in accordance with legislation in force and to fulfil special needs, exclude from the provisions of this Directive medicinal products supplied in response to a bona fide unsolicited order, formulated in accordance with the specifications of an authorized healthcare professional and for use by an individual patient under his direct personal responsibility. 
 The use of medical cannabis can therefore only be authorized by member states upon medical prescription and when there is a medical need for the patient. 
 As a consequence of the above, the regulations with respect to medical cannabis vary greatly amongst member states. While some EU member states, including Germany, and the UK have adopted specific legal provisions and frameworks governing the distribution and use of medical cannabis, and other EU member states have launched official pilot programs (e.g. France), the status of medical cannabis in other member states remains unclear. 
 On February 13, 2019, the European Parliament adopted a motion for a resolution on use of cannabis for medicinal purposes (2018/2775(RSP) recognizing that: 
 UN conventions and international law do not prevent the medicinal use of cannabis or cannabis-based products for the treatment of specific medical conditions; and 
 EU Member States differ widely in their approach to cannabis legislation, including their legislation on cannabis for medical purposes, such as on the maximum allowed levels of THC and CBD concentrations, which can lead to difficulties for countries applying a more prudent approach. 
 In this respect, the European Parliament specifically called on the European Commission and member state authorities to (amongst other things): 
 work together to provide a legal definition of medical cannabis, and to draw a clear distinction between cannabis-based medicines approved by the EMA or other regulatory agencies, medical cannabis not supported by clinical trials, and other applications of cannabis (e.g. recreational or industrial). 
 At the reconvened 63rd session of the UN CND, which took place on December 2, 2020, the twelve (12) EU member states who are also members of the CND acted upon the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to adjust the classification of cannabis and cannabis-related substances under the international drug conventions, while ensuring that they remain subject to the most relevant international control. The vote 
 
103 


  was in accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2021/3 of November 23, 2020, which had stipulated the position to be taken by the relevant member states on behalf of the EU. In particular, the EU supported the deletion of cannabis and cannabis resin from Schedule IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as recommended by the WHO, considering that it would allow more research, in line with evidence-based drugs policy, on the medical use of cannabis and cannabis resin. 
 GERMANY 
 Germany Regulatory Landscape 
 The importation and distribution of medical cannabis in Germany is mainly covered by the German Narcotics Law (Betäubungsmittelgesetz  BtMG), the German Pharmaceutical Act (Arzneimittelgesetz  AMG), and the German Narcotics Foreign Trade Ordinance (Betäubungsmittelaußenhandelsverordnung  BtMAHV). The relevant competent authority is the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte  BfArM), its sub-units the Federal Cannabis Authority (Cannabisagentur) and the Federal Opium Office (Bundesopiumstelle), and German state authorities. 
 Cannabis is a narcotic drug according to sec. 1 (1) BtMG, as it is listed in Annexes I to III of the BtMG (exceptions include seeds, cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content not exceeding 0.2 %, etc.  these are not classified as narcotic drugs). Therefore, it is a criminal offence to illicitly cultivate, produce and trade in cannabis or, without engaging in its trade, to import, export, sell, supply, otherwise place it on the market or acquire or procure it in any other way (sec. 29 (1) sent. 1 no. 1 BtMG). 
 The Act on the Amendment of Narcotic Drugs and Other Regulations (Gesetz zur Änderung betäubungsmittelrechtlicher und anderer Vorschriften  BtMRÄndG), which came into force on March 10, 2017, amended the national narcotic laws and other related provisions thus legalizing the cultivation, distribution and consumption of cannabis for medical purposes. Prior to this legislative change, the import of cannabis was not permitted, and only in exceptional circumstances (upon medical prescription), pharmacies could request such medical cannabis (abroad) for specific patients, provided a special case-by-case approval issued by BfArM had been obtained. Since then, medical cannabis (cultivated for medical purposes in other countries in accordance with Articles 23 and 28 of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) can be imported and marketed in Germany by private companies provided they have obtained the relevant licenses. 
 Prescribing and Dispensing Regime 
 These provisions enable doctors to prescribe medical cannabis for certain indications. 
 Medical cannabis is  in general  either distributed as a so-called magistral medicinal preparation (Rezepturarzneimittel) in the form of medicinal cannabis flowers, as a cannabis extract or as a specific composition of the active substance dronabinol (THC). 
 According to sec. 13 (2) sent. 1 BtMG, the supply of cannabis to patients is only permitted through pharmacies upon a special prescription for this purpose. The exact recipe instructions for such magistral preparations are laid down in the New Prescription Form, which is the standard work for drug production in pharmacies and is part of the German Drug Codex (DAC). 
 Reimbursement Regime 
 Health insurance is statutorily mandated in Germany, and residents are covered by either statutory health insurance plans (covering approximately 88% of the population) or private health insurance. 
 
104 


 Until 2017, only cannabis-derived products authorized as finished medicinal products could be prescribed and marketed in Germany and basically only cannabis intended for the manufacture of finished medicinal products containing cannabis could be imported. Since March 10, 2017, it has become possible for medical cannabis to be prescribed at the expense of the Statutory Health Insurance carriers in Germany upon their prior approval. The conditions are set out in sec. 31 (6) German Social Code Book V (Fünftes Sozialgesetzbuch  SGB V). 
 According to sec. 31 (6) SGB V insured persons with a serious disease are entitled to be supplied with cannabis in the form of dried flowers or extracts in standardized quality (and to be supplied with pharmaceuticals containing the active substances dronabinol or nabilone) if (i) a generally recognized treatment in accordance with medical standards is not available or  in the opinion of the treating physician  cannot be used in the individual case and (ii) there is a not entirely remote prospect of a notable positive effect on the course of the disease or of serious symptoms. 
 The new Law for More Safety in the Supply of Pharmaceuticals in Germany (Gesetz für mehr Sicherheit in der Arzneimittelversorgung  GSAV) even facilitates access to medical cannabis for those patients who already have a prescription or who have been hospitalized and further enables patients to switch smoothly between cannabis products without having to wait for a respective approval. 
 Germany Licensing Requirements 
 In accordance with the current German regulatory regime, for private companies to import and distribute medical cannabis in Germany, a License for the Trade in Narcotic Drugs, an Import Authorization, and likely a Wholesale Trading Authorization, are required. The import license can only be obtained by a company with business activity in Germany. 

(a) | License for the Trade in Narcotics Drugs  Sec. 3 (1) BtMG
----+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Sec. 3 (1) BtMG stipulates that a license is required for all operations relating to the trading of narcotic drugs: 
 A license issued by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices shall be required by any person who seeks to cultivate, produce or trade in narcotic drugs, or without engaging in their trade import, export, supply, sell, otherwise place them on the market or acquire them [ ]. 
 This license is issued for the relevant company, institution etc., for the respective site, and for the required scope of the trade in narcotic drugs. It is issued by the Federal Cannabis Agency (Cannabisagentur), a sub-unit of BfArM, upon application in accordance with sec. 1 German Narcotics Foreign Trade Ordinance (BtMAHV). BfArM shall decide on the issue of a license within three months of receipt of the application. Further details and requirements are regulated in sec. 3 through 10 BtMG and the BtMAHV. 
 

(b) | Import Authorization (for Narcotic Drugs)  Sec. 11 BtMG
----+---------------------------------------------------------

 For each import of narcotics, an import authorization issued by BfArM is required according to sec. 11 (1) sent. 1 BtMG. The procedure for issuing import authorizations is more specifically governed by the BtMAHV: 
 Any person who seeks to import or export narcotic drugs in an individual case shall require an authorization from the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in addition to the license required pursuant to sec. 3. 
 BfArM may inter alia refuse the import license or restrict the quantity of the narcotics according to the estimate of cannabis as notified with the International Narcotics Control Board or if the safety or control of narcotics traffic cannot be guaranteed. 
 The import license is issued in triplicate on official forms. Two copies shall be sent to the importer and one copy to the authority responsible for narcotics control in the exporting country. Most countries make exports 
 
105 


  dependent on the existence of an import permit. The approval cannot be transferred to third parties (sec. 3 (2) sent. 1 BtMAHV). It shall be limited to a maximum of three months (six months for imports by sea) ((sec. 3 (2) sent. 2 BtMAHV). If the narcotics are not imported within this time frame, the import authorization must be returned to BfArM (Sec. 6 (3) BtMAHV). 
 Key requirements for the aforementioned licenses according to sec. 3 through 11 BtMG are: 
 

(i) | It must be ensured that one person is appointed at the company who is responsible for compliance with the regulations governing narcotics and the orders of the supervisory authorities for every place of business. Such responsible person must have the necessary expertise. According to sec. 6 BtMG, the expertise must be proven, depending on the type of business of the company. For import and distribution of narcotics, the expertise of the responsible person is proven by a certificate of completed vocational training as a merchant in wholesale and foreign trade in the fields of chemistry or pharmacy and by documentation confirming a period of practical work in the trade in narcotic drugs of at least one year. The applicant and the responsible person must be reliable. Concerns about reliability may arise, for example, from physical or mental handicaps, like addiction to alcohol or narcotics, as well as previous convictions, especially for narcotic drug offences.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Suitable premises, installations and security measures must be available (sec. 5 (1) no. 4 BtMG).
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | The holder of a license according to sec. 3 BtMG has certain obligations after the license is issued, which include keeping records for each increase and decrease in stock according to sec. 17 BtMG as well as the submission of half-yearly notifications for each site of the quantity of the products to BfArM according to sec. 18 BtMG.
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | The holder of the license shall also inform BfArM of any changes of relevant information specified in sec. 7 BtMG (i.e., the information that shall be provided with the application).
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(v) | An application for a new license shall be required in the event of changes in the scope of trading with narcotic drugs, changes in respect of the person holding the license or the location of the sites.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Wholesale Trading Authorization  Sec. 52 a AMG
----+------------------------------------------------

 Medical cannabis also falls under the definition of a medicinal product (sec. 2 (1) AMG), and in this respect: 
 Any person, who engages in the wholesale trading of medicinal products [ ], requires an authorization to do so. (Sec. 52a (1) sent. 1 AMG). 
 If private companies trade medical cannabis as wholesalers, a Wholesale Trading Authorization is required according to sec. 52a AMG. Wholesale trade is defined in sec. 4 (22) AMG: 
 Wholesale trade in medicinal products is any professional or commercial activity for the purpose of doing business which consists of the procuring, storing, supplying or exporting of medicinal products, with the exception of the dispensing of medicinal products to consumers other than physicians, dentists, veterinarians or hospitals. 
 Usually, the company which applies for the import license regarding the import of medical cannabis also has a German authorization on wholesale trading of medicinal products (Großhandelserlaubnis) in accordance with sec. 52a AMG. 
 

(d) | Import Authorization  Sec. 72 AMG
----+-----------------------------------

 If medical cannabis is imported from non-EU/EEA countries, an import authorization for medicinal products according to sec. 72 AMG is also required: 
 A party wishing to bring: 1. medicinal products within the meaning of sec. 2 (1) or (2) no. 1 [ ] on a commercial or professional basis, into the purview of the present Act from countries which are not Member 
 
106 


  States of the European Communities or other States party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area shall require an authorization by the competent authority (Sec. 72 (1) AMG). 
 

(e) | Further Possible Licensing Requirements
----+----------------------------------------

 For medical cannabis treated with ionizing radiation, according to sec. 1 (3) (Verordnung über radioaktive oder mit ionisierenden Strahlen behandelte Arzneimittel  AMRadV), a marketing authorization may be required. This applies to cannabis, in the manufacture of which electron, gamma or x-ray radiation has been used to reduce the bacterial count. 
 For the sake of completeness, we note that several other licenses might also be required, i.e., a marketing authorization for cannabis-based medicinal products or, in case the medical cannabis is processed, packed, labeled etc. in Germany, a manufacturing authorization. 
 THE UNITED KINGDOM 
 The UK Regulatory Landscape 
 The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 
 (a) The legalization of medical cannabis
In June 2018, the Home Secretary announced a two-part review of the scheduling of cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3998) (2001 Regulations). At that time, cannabis and many of its derivatives were Class B controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (MDA) and listed in Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations. 
 The Class (A, B and C) of a controlled drug under the MDA broadly relates to the particular drugs potential for harm and dictates the penalties for committing related offences (such as unlawful possession). The scheduling (1  5) of a controlled drug under the 2001 Regulations relates to the particular drugs medical benefits and the conditions under which such drugs can be accessed for legitimate purposes (i.e., Schedule 1 controlled drugs are considered to have little or no known therapeutic value and are subject to the strictest restrictions). 
 The first part of the review, conducted by the Chief Medical Officer for England and Chief Medical Advisor to the UK Government, found that there was conclusive evidence of the therapeutic value of cannabis-based products for certain medical conditions and reasonable evidence of therapeutic benefit for several other medical conditions. On this basis, the review recommended that cannabis-based medicinal products be removed from Schedule 1 under the 2001 Regulations. 
 In light of this recommendation, the UK Government asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) to provide short-term advice. Amongst other things, the ACMD recommended that cannabis-derived medicinal products of the appropriate medicinal standard be moved from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 of the 2001 Regulations. The ACMD also recommended that synthetic cannabinoids remain in Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations pending further consideration of their potential rescheduling. 
 Accepting these recommendations, the UK Government introduced the Misuse of Drugs (Amendments) (Cannabis and License Fees) (England, Wales and Scotland) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/1055), which came into force on November 1, 2018 and apply to England, Wales and Scotland. These Regulations amended the 2001 Regulations to reschedule cannabis-based products for medicinal use in humans as Schedule 2 drugs, thereby allowing such products to be available by prescription, subject to certain controls and restrictions. Parallel changes were made to the relevant legislation applicable in Northern Ireland. 
 A cannabis-based product for medicinal use (CBPM) is defined as a preparation or other product which: 
 

i) | is or contains cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabinol or a cannabinol derivative (not being dronabinol or its stereoisomers); and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
107 


 
ii) | is produced for medical use in humans; and
----+-------------------------------------------


iii) | is a medicinal product or a substance or preparation for use as an ingredient of, or in the production of an ingredient of, a medicinal product.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All other cannabis-based products not falling within this definition remain Schedule 1 drugs under the 2001 Regulations and are accessible only by Home Office license. However, products falling within the definition of exempt product under the 2001 Regulations are not subject to the restrictions on possession, production, supply, import or export. An exempt product is: 
 a preparation or other product consisting of one or more component parts, any of which contains a controlled drug, where 
 

(a) | the preparation or other product is not designed for administration of the controlled drug to a human being or animal;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | the controlled drug in any component part is packaged in such a form, or in combination with other active or inert substances in such a manner, that it cannot be recovered by readily applicable means or in a yield which constitutes a risk to health; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | no one component part of the product or preparation contains more than one milligram of the controlled drug or one microgram in the case of lysergide or any other N -alkyl derivative of lysergamide;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cannabis, cannabis resin, cannabinol and cannabinol derivatives (including cannabis-based medicinal products) remain Class B controlled drugs under the MDA. 
 The UK Government asked the ACMD to carry out a longer-term review of CBPMs, which (amongst other things) will: 
 

 | Assess the impact of the change in legislation on CBPMs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | Provide advice on whether the scheduling of products falling within the definition of CBPM is appropriate;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Consider whether any further legislative amendments are required regarding CBPMs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advise on the classification and rescheduling of synthetic cannabinoids under the MDA and 2001 Regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ACMD provided its report and recommendations on November 27, 2020. In summary, the ACMD recommended that: 
 

 | The rescheduling of CBPMs remains appropriate and no further legislative amendments are required at this time. However, in the event that there is a marked increase in the number of CBPMs achieving marketing authorization and being individually considered as candidates for rescheduling, the ACMD will again review the scheduling of CBPMs as a whole;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The ACMD should be commissioned to conduct a further assessment of the impact of the rescheduling of CBPMs in the two years following the publication of the report as there is not yet sufficient evidence available to fully assess any and all consequences of the legislative change;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The availability of a patient registry for CBPMs should be recognized as crucial for future assessments of the impact of the rescheduling of such products and the UK government should continue to support the development of an official patient registry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Research should be commissioned to assess the impacts of the rescheduling of CBPMs on public knowledge and attitudes towards cannabis, unlicensed CBPMs, licensed CBPMs and licensed cannabis-based medicines and to explore the safety, quality and efficacy of unlicensed CBPMs, licensed CBPMs and licensed cannabis- based medicines; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
108 


 
 | Government departments should conduct a full review of international approaches to legislation facilitating the medicinal usage of cannabis-based medicines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | General requirements and restrictions
----+--------------------------------------

 The existing requirements for Schedule 2 controlled drugs apply to CBPMs. These include requirements in relation to safe custody, prescriptions, marked bottles and other containers, record keeping and preservation of documents, and destruction. For example: 
 

 | A Schedule 2 controlled drug must be stored in a locked receptacle, usually in an appropriate controlled drugs cabinet or approved safe, which can only be opened by the person in lawful possession of the product or a person authorized by that person;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A person supplying a Schedule 2 controlled drug, otherwise than on prescription, to, for example, a practitioner, hospital, care home or laboratory, must ensure that the requisition for such drug was made in writing and (unless the supplier is a wholesale dealer) send the requisition to the relevant National Health Service (NHS) agency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A person supplying a Schedule 2 controlled drug (e.g. a pharmacist) must (amongst other things) take certain steps to confirm that the prescription is compliant, the address of the person issuing the prescription is within the UK, and the signature on the prescription is genuine;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The package and container of a Schedule 2 controlled drug must be plainly marked with the amount of the drug, including the amount in each dosage unit, and the percentage of each component which is a controlled drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Registers must be kept, for at least two years, in respect of each class of Scheduled 2 controlled drug in accordance with specific requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Schedule 2 controlled drugs must only be destroyed in the presence of a person authorized by the Home Office.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Access restrictions
----+--------------------

 Schedule 2 drugs can generally be prescribed by a medical practitioner. However, additional restrictions for medical cannabis (i.e., cannabis-based products without a marketing authorization) apply. Such products can only be prescribed by a doctor on the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council (GMC) or be supplied in the context of a clinical trial (provided the legislation regulating clinical trials is fully complied with). This restriction is removed for medicinal cannabis products with a marketing authorization, which can be prescribed by a general practitioner for patient use as with other Schedule 2 drugs. The rescheduling of CBPMs therefore brings medical cannabis (i.e., those products without a marketing authorization) into the existing UK Specials medicines framework, outlined below. 
 The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 
 

(a) | Special medicines framework
----+----------------------------

 The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (HM Regulations) implement Directive 2001/83/EC into UK domestic law. In the case of cannabis-based medicinal products, a marketing authorization means that the product can be prescribed by a general practitioner in the UK. However, as indicated above, there are a number of exemptions to the requirement to obtain a marketing authorization, which recognize the need to allow unauthorized products to be supplied to meet the special needs of a particular patient (among other exemptions). This exemption is known as the Specials regime and is based on the aforementioned Article 5(1) of EU Directive 2001/83/EC. 
 Under the Specials regime, an unauthorized medicinal product should not be supplied where an equivalent authorized medical product can meet the special clinical needs of the particular patient. Guidance published by 
 
109 


  the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) provides that anyone supplying an unlicensed CBPM must be satisfied as to the existence of a special need, and that the MHRA expects that documentary evidence of this special need should be obtained by manufacturers, importers or distributors. 
 NHS England has also confirmed that it expects that rigorous and auditable safeguards around the prescribing of medical cannabis will be followed, and that such products will only be prescribed for indications where there is clear published evidence of benefit and where established treatment options have been exhausted.30
Concern has been expressed that patients in the UK who meet the special needs test are not readily able to access prescriptions for medical cannabis and that the current prescribing guidelines for the specialist doctors are overly restrictive. In light of this, further measures are anticipated noting, in particular, that: 
 NHS England has been asked to carry out a process evaluation as soon as possible to assess barriers to prescribing medical cannabis; 
 The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and the relevant drug companies have been asked to produce evidence around medical cannabis to improve the evidence base. The NIHR has since issued two calls for research proposals; 
 NHS England and Health Education England have produced an online training program for doctors to support them in prescribing medical cannabis; 
 In November 2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines for prescribing medical cannabis in the UK; and 
 The results of a Parliamentary inquiry by the Health and Social Care Select Committee (HSCSC) into the usage of medical cannabis in the UK were published on 3 July 2019. The HSCSC made a number of recommendations, including calling on NIHR and the Department of Health and Social Care to encourage and focus research into those specific conditions where the Chief Medical Officers report found good evidence for the use of cannabis based medicinal products. 

(b) | General requirements and restrictions
----+--------------------------------------

 The HM Regulations, along with MHRA guidance on the supply of Specials, impose a number of requirements on manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and other suppliers of medicinal products containing narcotics, including cannabis, including in relation to packaging and labeling, advertising, pharmacovigilance and record keeping. For example: 
 

 | Medical cannabis should be labeled in accordance with best practice and, at a minimum, should include the name of the product, a statement of the content/ratio of THC/CBD, the route of administration, the dosage, and special warnings. Separately, when the product is dispensed, the pharmacist should ensure that the usual dispensing label provisions are applied;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medical cannabis must not be advertised. There are some limited exemptions, including where trade catalogue or circular is sent to an authorized healthcare professional in order to respond to an unsolicited request for information on the range of products supplied, provided no product claim is made;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | All persons selling or supplying medical cannabis (including manufacturers, importers, distributers, and specialist doctors) must report any suspected adverse drug reactions and failures of efficacy. Wholesalers are under an obligation to keep records and report any serious adverse reactions to the MHRA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Persons selling or supplying medical cannabis in the UK must maintain records for at least five years containing prescribed information, including the names of each product and the brand/supplier, the source of each product, to whom and when each supply was made, and a record of any suspected adverse reactions. Each person must make the records available for inspection by the MHRA on request.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UK Licensing Requirements 
 The MDA, 2001 Regulations and/or HM Regulations impose restrictions on, and/or require licenses be held by persons manufacturing/producing, importing, distributing, supplying, possessing and exporting medical cannabis. For example: 

 | A manufacturer or producer of medical cannabis in the UK must hold a manufacturers (specials) license under the HM Regulations and a Home Office license under the MDA and 2001 Regulations, unless an exemption applies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An importer of medical cannabis into the UK must hold a Home Office license under the MDA, in addition to either a (i) wholesale dealers license (if the product is to be imported from an EEA member state), or (ii) manufacturers (specials) license (if the product is to be imported from a third country) under the HM Regulations. In addition, following the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, a wholesale dealer in Great Britain must employ a Responsible Person (import) (RPi) resident in the UK in relation to products imported from the EEA and may only import Qualified Person (QP) certified medicines from the EEA if certain checks are made by the RPi;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Distribution by wholesale dealing (i.e. excluding supply of the products to the public) must be through licensed wholesale dealers under the HM Regulations. Home Office licenses for possession and supply will also be required for activities associated with distribution (such as possession and supply), unless an exemption applies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medical cannabis without a marketing authorization can only be prescribed to a patient by a doctor on the Specialist Register of the GMC under the 2001 Regulations. Patients are able to lawfully possess the product for medical use in accordance with a valid prescription; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Medical cannabis that is lawfully manufactured in, or imported into, the UK pursuant to a manufacturers (specials) license or a wholesale dealers license may be exported to other EU/EEA countries, provided it is lawful in the receiving country and the exporter complies with the relevant national requirements of the receiving country. Medical cannabis exported to non-EU/EEA countries are not Specials and so must be manufactured by the holder of an ordinary manufacturers license, batch released and certified by a qualified person. A Home Office license will also be required for export under the MDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | For certain groups, for example, pharmacists and persons carrying out a retail pharmacy business, the 2001 Regulations allow the possession, supply and production of controlled drugs without the need for a Home Office license.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 CBD based consumer products 
 EU Regulatory Landscape 
 Cannabidiol (CBD) in its own right is not considered a controlled substance at international or national level. It is not included in the Schedules to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. This position has been confirmed by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) in its comprehensive Critical Review Report of CBD of June 2018, which further states that there is no evidence of [ ] any public health-related problems associated with the use of pure CBD. The ECDD accordingly recommended that preparations considered to be pure CBD should not be scheduled within the international drug conventions as CBD does not have psychoactive properties and presents no potential for abuse or dependence. Consequently, the WHO has confirmed that its legal status in countries is something for national regulators to decide. 
 In its Kanavape judgment dated November 19, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) unequivocally confirmed that CBD is not a narcotic drug, including CBD extracted from the Cannabis sativa L.

plant in its entirety (and thus not only its seeds and/or fiber), and that EU member states may not prohibit its marketing as such. By means of this landmark judgment, the CJEU ended the on-going debate in Europe whether CBD extracted from the hemp plant should be considered as a narcotic drug because it constitutes a cannabis extract within the meaning of Schedule I of the Single Convention. The CJEU ruled that: 
 since CBD does not contain a psychoactive ingredient in the current state of scientific knowledge [ ], it would be contrary to the purpose and general spirit of the Single Convention to include it under the definition of drugs within the meaning of that convention as a cannabis extract. 
 The CJEUs judgment has important implications for the use of CBD in consumer products, i.e., cosmetic and food products in particular. 
 (a) Cosmetic products
Regulation (EC) N° 1223/2009 on cosmetic products (the Cosmetics Regulation) sets forth the regulatory framework for cosmetic products in the EU. The Cosmetics Regulation, among other things, establishes the safety requirements for cosmetic products (i.e., a safety assessment is required prior to commercialization), centralizes the notification of cosmetic products placed on the EU market through the Cosmetics Product Notification Portal (CPNP) and introduces several other obligations for companies that are manufacturing and/or marketing cosmetics in the EU. 
 The Cosmetics Regulation specifically restricts the use of certain substances in cosmetic products, i.e., Annex 2 contains a list of substances prohibited in cosmetic products while Annex 3 lists restricted substances which can only be used in accordance with the specified restrictions. The prohibited substances listed in Annex 2 include narcotics, natural and synthetic: all substances listed in Table 1 and 2 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs signed in New York on 30 March 1961, which include cannabis and cannabis resin and extracts and tinctures of cannabis. Consequently, as the 1961 Single Convention does not schedule CBD specifically, the use of CBD in cosmetics has in principle always been allowed, as confirmed by the specific inclusion of synthetically produced CBD in the EU cosmetics ingredients database (CosIng). However, by reference to the UN Single Convention, some ambiguity remained as to whether CBD produced as extracts and/or tinctures of  the flowering or fruiting tops of  cannabis could be used in cosmetics. 
 In its Kanavape judgment, the CJEU indeed clarified that since CBD does not contain a psychoactive ingredient in the current state of scientific knowledge [ ], it would be contrary to the purpose and general spirit of the Single Convention to include it under the definition of drugs within the meaning of that convention as a cannabis extract. Consequently, following this judgment, in early February 2021, the European Commission expressly confirmed  by means of an update of the CosIng database  that natural CBD, derived from extract or tincture or resin of cannabis, may be used in cosmetics. The CosIng database further specifies that CBD has the following cosmetic functions: (i) anti-sebum, (ii) antioxidant; (iii) skin conditioning; and (iv) skin protecting. 
 As a consequence, CBD based cosmetic products can be marketed in the EU provided they comply with the relevant requirements of the Cosmetics Regulation and national laws and regulations as may be applicable. 
 Pursuant to Brexit, since 1 January 2021, the EU Withdrawal Act provides for EU law to be retained by adaptation into UK law. This means that in the short term UK law will be constituted of retained EU law, and therefore mirror EU law, with some differences in some mechanisms and additional administrative formalities (e.g. UK product notifications). However, at present, Brexit is not expected to have any specific impact on the status of CBD for use in cosmetics in the UK. 
 (b) Food products 
Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (the General Food Law Regulation) establishes that only safe food can be placed on the EU market and establishes basic criteria for establishing whether a food is safe. It aims to ensure

  free movement of food manufactured and marketed in the EU and establishes a principle of risk analysis based on scientific and technical evaluations undertaken by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It is a basic precondition of the General Food Law Regulation that food must be safe, albeit in general, food products do not require prior authorisation in order to be placed on the market in the EU. 
 Article 2 of the EU General Food Law Regulation specifies that food shall not include [ ] 
 narcotic or psychotropic substances within the meaning of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971. 
 Through its ruling in the Kanavape case that CBD is not a narcotic drug under the Single Convention, including CBD extracted from the Cannabis sativa L. plant in its entirety, the CJEU also  indirectly  confirmed that CBD, either synthetically or naturally produced, may generally be used in food and beverages in the European Union. 
 CBD is currently considered a so-called novel food in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 (the Novel Food Regulation) given that the European Commission takes the view that CBD was not used as a food or food ingredient before May 15, 1997 and a history of consumption has not been demonstrated. The (non-binding) EU Novel Food Catalogue confirms this through its entry for cannabinoids in general: 
 The hemp plant (Cannabis sativa L.) contains a number of cannabinoids and the most common ones are as follows: [ ] cannabidiol (CBD) [ ]. Without prejudice to the information provided in the novel food catalogue for the entry relating to Cannabis sativa L., extracts of Cannabis sativa L. and derived products containing cannabinoids are considered novel foods as a history of consumption has not been demonstrated. This applies to both the extracts themselves and any products to which they are added as an ingredient (such as hemp seed oil). This also applies to extracts of other plants containing cannabinoids. Synthetically obtained cannabinoids are considered as novel. 
 CBD extracts and food products (including beverages) containing CBD may therefore only be placed on the market as a food or food ingredient in the EU following a safety assessment by EFSA and authorization by the European Commission in accordance with the Novel Food Regulation. In practice, this results in the European Commission adopting an implementing act authorizing the placing on the market of a novel food and updating the so-called Union list. If the novel food is liable to have an effect on human health, the Commission will request EFSA to carry out a risk assessment first. Following the aforementioned Kanavape judgment, the European Commission confirmed in a public statement that the currently pending novel food applications for CBD are being evaluated and processed. 
 As a consequence, CBD based food products can be marketed in the EU once they have obtained a Novel Food authorization covering their specific use and comply with the relevant requirements of the General Food Law and Novel Food Regulation as well as national laws and regulations as applicable. 
 In the UK, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has taken the position that CBD containing food products which were on sale in the UK on February 13, 2020 and are linked to an application which is submitted to the FSA by March 31, 2021 which was subsequently validated can remain on sale in England and Wales pending the assessment of these applications, i.e., until they have been considered by independent scientific committees and a decision on authorization has been made. A list of the products that may remain on the UK market until a decision is made on their authorization is published on the FSA website.
