(the “Company”) provides desktop activity intelligence, process intelligence and automation software to help organizations isolate issues and automate employee tasks in the contact center and back office. The Company provides an innovative and unique combination of application and process integration, automation, and desktop analytics capabilities, all without changing the underlying applications or requiring costly application development. The Company’s software collects desktop activity and application performance data and tracks business objects across time and multiple users, as well as measures against defined expected business process flows, for either analysis or to feed a third-party application. In addition to software solutions, the Company also provides technical support, training and consulting services as part of its commitment to providing customers with industry-leading solutions. The Company’s consulting team has in-depth experience in developing successful enterprise-class solutions as well as valuable insight into the business information needs of customers in the largest Fortune 500 corporations worldwide.
  
 The Company focuses on the activity intelligence, process intelligence and customer experience management market with emphasis on desktop analytics and automation with its Cicero Discovery™, Cicero Insight™ and Cicero Automation™ products. Activity intelligence captures what employees are doing, what resources they are using and how long an activity may take. Process intelligence captures the workflows that are being utilized and identifies any bottlenecks that exist within those workflows.
  
 Cicero Discovery collects desktop activity leveraging a suite of sensors. Cicero Discovery is a lightweight and configurable tool to collect activity and application performance data and track business objects across time and across multiple users as well as measure against a defined "expected" business process flow, either for analysis or to feed a third-party application.

  Cicero Discovery™
  Cicero Discovery collects activity and application performance data and tracks business objects across time and across multiple users, as well as measures against a defined "expected" business process flow, either for analysis or to feed a third-party application. Cicero Discovery is invisible to the end user – it gathers data about what they do, what applications they run, how those applications are used, the health of their computer and the type of data they are working on that the company is interested in. These data are collected and stored centrally and can be tracked in real-time or via deferred processing.
 Cicero Insight™
  Cicero Insight is a measurement and analytics solution that collects and presents high value information about quality, productivity, compliance, and revenue from frontline activity to target areas for improvement. Using a set of configurable sensors at the employees’ desktop Cicero Insight collects activity data about the applications, when and how they are used and makes it readily available for analysis and action to the business community.

  Sales and Marketing
  
  Sales
  
 An important element of our sales strategy is to supplement our direct sales force by expanding our relationships with third parties to increase market awareness and acceptance of our business integration software solutions. As part of these relationships, we continue to jointly sell and implement our software solutions with strategic partners such as systems integrators and embed our software along with other products through reseller relationships.  We provide training and other support necessary to systems integrators and resellers to aid in the promotion of our products.  To date we have entered into technology partnerships for integrated business solutions with Teleopti, Avaya/KnoahSoft, Nexidia, Telnorm and Heartcore. In addition, we have entered into strategic partnerships with Aspect, eg solutions and Convergys. These organizations have relationships with existing customers or have access to organizations requiring top secret or classified access.  In addition, several of these partners can bundle our software with other software to provide a comprehensive solution to customers.  We are not materially dependent on any of these organizations. Generally, our agreements with such partners provide for price discounts based on their sales volume, with no minimum required volume. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contacts with Customers (Topic 606) as of January 1, 2018. Based on the evaluation the Company performed on its customer contracts, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flow, accounting policies, business processes, internal controls or disclosures.
 Marketing
  
 The target markets for our products and services are in the financial services, insurance, and healthcare industries, as well as users in the intelligence and security communities and other governmental organizations. Increasing competitiveness and consolidation is driving companies in such businesses to increase efficiency, improve the user experience and improve the quality of their customer contact centers. As a result, companies are compelled by both economic necessity and internal mandates to find ways to increase internal efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, increase effective cross-selling, decrease staff turnover cost and leverage their investment in current information technology.
  
 Our marketing team has an in-depth understanding of business performance and user experience software marketplaces and the needs of these customers, as well as experience in all of the key marketing disciplines. They also have knowledge across industries in financial services, insurance, healthcare, and government organizations that have focused on application integration and business process automation solutions to address needs in mergers and acquisitions and homeland security.
  
 Core marketing functions include product marketing, digital marketing and public relations. We utilize focused marketing programs that are intended to attract potential customers in our target vertical industries and to promote our Company and our brands. Our marketing programs are specifically directed at our target markets, and include speaking engagements, public relations campaigns, focused trade shows and web site marketing, while devoting substantial resources to supporting the field sales team with high quality sales tools and ancillary material. As product acceptance grows and our target markets increase, we will shift to broader marketing programs.

 The marketing department also produces ancillary material for presentation or distribution to prospects, including demonstrations, presentation materials, white papers, case studies, articles, brochures, and data sheets.
  
  Research and Product Development
  
 We incurred research and development expense of approximately $991,000 and $1,071,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
  
 Cicero Discovery, Cicero Insight, and Cicero Automation are products that exist in a rapidly changing technology environment and as such, it is imperative to constantly enhance the features and functionality of these products. Our budget for research and development is based on planned product introductions and enhancements. Actual expenditures, however, may significantly differ from budgeted expenditures. Inherent in the product development process are a number of risks. The development of new, technologically advanced software products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends.
 Competition
  
 The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. These markets are highly fragmented and served by numerous firms. We believe that the competitive factors affecting the markets for our products and services include:
  
  ● 
 Product functionality and features;

 
  ● 
 Availability and quality of support services;

 
  ● 
 Ease of product implementation;

 
  ● 
 Price;

 
  ● 
 Product reputation; and

 
  ● 
 Our financial stability.

 
 The relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the specific customer environment. Although we believe that our products and services can compete favorably, we may not be able to increase our competitive position against current and potential competitors. In addition, many companies choose to deploy their own information technology personnel or utilize system developers to write new code or rewrite existing applications in an effort to deploy solutions to desktops. As a result, prospective customers may decide against purchasing and implementing externally developed and produced solutions such as ours.
  
 We compete with companies that utilize varying approaches to modernize, web-enable and integrate existing software applications:
  
  ●
Middleware software provides integration of applications through messages and data exchange implemented typically in the middle tier of the application architecture. This approach requires modification of the application source code and substantial infrastructure investments and operational expense. Reuters, TIBCO and IBM MQSeries are competitors in the middleware market.

 
  ●
CRM software offers application tools that allow developers to build product specific interfaces and custom applications. This approach is not designed to be product neutral and is often dependent on deep integration with our technology. Siebel and Salesforce.com are representative products in the CRM software category.

 
  ●
Recently, there have been several companies that offer capabilities similar to our software in that these companies advertise that they can capture desktop activity and integrate applications without modifying the underlying code for those applications. Pegasystems is one company who advertises that they can capture desktop activity and provide integration at the point of contact or on the desktop.

 
 Our product competes directly with other back office and contact center solutions offered by Pegasystems, Jacada, Verint, and NICE. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies. Furthermore, our competitors may combine with each other, or other companies may enter our markets by acquiring or entering into strategic relationships with our competitors. Many of our current competitors have greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have.
