 Disclosure of reserves 
 Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end
The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2021, as detailed in the “Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” part of the “Financial section”, starting on page 42 of this report. 
 All of the company’s reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2021 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

Total net proved | | 16 | | 281 | | 438 | | 2,216 | 2,717


(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGL proved reserves are not material and are therefore included under liquids.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The estimation of proved reserve volumes, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures, and development and production costs, and other factors. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the company’s capital spending and also impact its partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects. 
 As a result of improved prices in 2021, under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition of proved reserves, an additional 1.7 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake qualified as proved reserves at year-end 2021.

  Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 
 Imperial’s proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 
 Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages. 
 In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
 Preparation of reserves estimates 
 Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperial’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official reserves estimates for Imperial’s proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 
 The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the company’s official reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company’s board of directors. 
 The internal qualified reserves evaluator is a professional geoscientist registered in Alberta, Canada and has 19 years of petroleum industry experience, including 10 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The company’s internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 25 persons with an average of 11 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 22 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The company’s internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 13 persons with an average of 11 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves.

  Proved undeveloped reserves 
 As at December 31, 2021, approximately 14 percent of the company’s proved reserves were proved undeveloped reflecting volumes of 386 million oil-equivalent barrels. Proved undeveloped reserves are associated with Syncrude, Cold Lake, and the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. This compared to 138 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2020. The increase of 248 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves includes an increase of 262 million oil-equivalent barrels at Cold Lake, an increase of 6 million oil-equivalent barrels at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets, partially offset by a decrease of 20 million oil-equivalent barrels at Syncrude. Conversion of proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed was 34 million oil-equivalent barrels during 2021, associated with Cold Lake and the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more represent about 53 percent (204 million oil-equivalent barrels) of proved undeveloped reserves and are associated with ongoing development programs at Cold Lake. These undeveloped reserves are planned to be developed in a staged approach to align with operational capacity and efficient capital spending commitment over the life of the asset. The company is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. 
 One of the company’s requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about $124 million during the year to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves at Cold Lake, Syncrude and the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. These investments represented about 20 percent of the $632 million in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.

Total | 16 | | 7 


Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 
 Cold Lake 
 To maintain production at Cold Lake, capital expenditures for additional production wells and associated facilities are required periodically. In 2021, additional wells were drilled on existing phases. In 2022, a development drilling program is planned within the approved development area to add productive capacity. 
 The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production or recovery techniques. 
 Aspen, Cold Lake expansion and other oil sands activities 
 In October 2018, the company received regulatory approval for the Aspen solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) project from the Alberta Energy Regulator. Development was proposed to occur in two phases, each producing about 75,000 barrels per day, before royalties. The first phase of the project was approved by the company’s board, and appropriated for $2.6 billion. Construction began late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In March 2019, the company slowed the pace of development given market uncertainty stemming from the Government of Alberta’s temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations and other industry competitiveness challenges. Although the Government of Alberta repealed the regulatory authority for imposing temporary production curtailments at the end of 2021, major investment remains on hold. Aspen’s project pace will continue to be evaluated and remains an important opportunity for Imperial. 
 
11 

  In August 2018, Imperial received regulatory approval from the Alberta Energy Regulator for an expansion project at Cold Lake to develop the Grand Rapids interval using SA-SAGD technology, capable of producing 50,000 barrels per day before royalties. Imperial intends to develop the Grand Rapids reservoir through capital-efficient investments that make use of available steam capacity from existing plants, with the initial phase of Grand Rapids development planned as an extension from the Nabiye plant. Imperial continues to progress this opportunity. 
 Work progresses on technical and technology evaluations to support potential Clarke Creek, Corner, Clyden and Chard in-situ development regulatory applications. 
 The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 
 Montney and Duvernay 
 The company owns a 50 percent interest in XTO Energy Canada which includes the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets located in central Alberta. In 2020, the company ramped down development drilling and revised long-term development plans to exclude a significant portion of the non-core, non-producing and undeveloped areas of the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. In 2021, the company resumed limited drilling activity to develop select portions of the acreage with other operators. In January 2022, Imperial announced its intention to market its interest in XTO Energy Canada jointly with ExxonMobil Canada, consistent with Imperial’s strategy to focus its upstream resources and efforts on its key oil sands assets. A definitive decision to sell the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets has not been made. Operations will continue as normal throughout the marketing process and should the process not result in a sale. XTO Energy Canada net production from these assets is about 140 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and about 9,000 barrels per day of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids. 
Beaufort Sea 
 The company holds a 25 percent interest in two exploration licences in the Beaufort Sea. In 2016, the Federal Government of Canada declared Arctic waters off limits to new offshore oil and gas licences for five years subject to review at the end of that period. Existing licences were not impacted. In June 2019, the Federal Government approved selective changes to the Canada Petroleum Resources Act to prohibit and freeze the existing licences through the completion of the Beaufort Sea Regional Environmental Assessment (BR-SEA) review. In 2021, the prohibition was extended until December 31, 2022, during which time the Federal Government will continue to consult with stakeholders as part of the BR-SEA review to address regional social, environmental, economic and spill response impacts of natural resource development in the Arctic. The company continues to hold the licences while maintaining community engagement and participation in the BR-SEA process. 
 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 
 The company continues to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region.

  Present activities 
 Review of principal ongoing activities 
 Kearl 
 Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 
 During 2021, the company’s share of Kearl’s net bitumen production was about 178,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 186,000 barrels per day. 
 Total gross production for Kearl was about 263,000 barrels per day (186,000 barrels Imperial’s share), setting a new record for Kearl and continuing multi-year improvements in reliability, costs and performance. Total gross production increased about 41,000 barrels per day (28,000 barrels Imperial’s share) compared to 2020, which was the asset’s previous annual production record. Increased production was primarily driven by the absence of prior year production balancing with market demands, supported by the supplemental crushers and other reliability improvements. Kearl also eliminated its fall turnaround and transitioned to a single annual turnaround, one year ahead of schedule. 
 Kearl successfully started up the first Kearl Boiler Flue Gas heat recovery unit in 2021. This technology recovers waste heat from a boiler’s combustion exhaust to pre-heat process water. This not only has the potential to reduce operating costs, but also emissions by up to 30,000 tonnes / year of carbon dioxide equivalent. Imperial is currently progressing plans to apply this innovative technology on up to five additional boilers. 
 Cold Lake 
 Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 During 2021, net bitumen production at Cold Lake was about 114,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 140,000 barrels per day. Gross production increased about 8,000 barrels per day compared to 2020 as a result of improved reliability, production optimizations, and recent capital-efficient infill drilling. 
 Syncrude 
 Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 In 2021, the company’s share of Syncrude’s net production of synthetic crude oil was about 62,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 71,000 barrels per day. 
 On September 30, 2021, operatorship successfully transferred from Syncrude Canada to Suncor. With the transition complete, additional synergies are expected to be captured, in an effort to maximize profitability and improve reliability. 
 The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Kearl, Cold Lake, and Syncrude oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations which are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 
 Delivery commitments 
 The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

  Western provinces 
 The company’s bitumen leases include about 161,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 68,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totalling about 173,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, about 34,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Aspen area, about 30,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Corner area, about 29,000 net acres in the Clarke Creek area and about 18,000 net acres in the Chard area. The 173,000 net acres are suitable for in-situ recovery techniques. 
 The company’s share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 55,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. 
 Oil sands leases have an exploration period of 15 years and are continued beyond that point by payment of escalating rentals or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 
 The company holds interests in an additional 867,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas, including about 369,000 net acres associated with the company’s unconventional portfolio in Alberta. These interests include lands that are part of Imperial’s recent announcement to market its interest in XTO Energy Canada jointly with ExxonMobil Canada. XTO Energy Canada assets include 568,000 net acres in the Montney shale, 85,000 net acres in the Duvernay shale and additional acreage in other areas of Alberta; Imperial owns a 50 percent interest in XTO Energy Canada. This is consistent with Imperial’s strategy to focus its upstream resources and efforts on its key oil sands assets. 
 Crude oil and natural gas leases and licences from the western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by proven production capability. 
 Canada lands 
 Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 
 Exploration licences on Canada lands have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 
 The company’s net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through ELs and SDLs. 
 Atlantic offshore 
 Exploration licences on Atlantic offshore have a finite term. The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production licences or held by SDLs.

  Downstream 
 Supply and trading 
 The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at negotiated market prices, in addition to undertaking trading activities. Purchases and sales are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including ExxonMobil. 
Transportation 
 Imperial currently transports the company’s crude oil production and third-party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal has total capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 
Refining 
 The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. The company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 
 The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput and utilization during the three years ended December 31, 2021, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2021, were as follows. 

 | Refinery throughput (a) | | Rated capacities (b)
 | Year ended December 31 | | at December 31 
thousands of barrels per day | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2019 | 2021
Strathcona, Alberta | | 172 | | 170 | 183 | 196 
Sarnia, Ontario | | 106 | | 86 | 86 | 119 
Nanticoke, Ontario | | 101 | | 84 | 84 | 113 
Total | | 379 | | 340 | 353 | 428 
Utilization of refinery capacity (percent) | | 89 | | 80 | 83 | 


(a) | Refinery throughput is the volume of crude oil and feedstocks that is processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Rated capacities are based on definite specifications as to types of crude oil and feedstocks that are processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units, the products to be obtained and the refinery process, adjusted to include an estimated allowance for normal maintenance shutdowns. Accordingly, actual capacities may be higher or lower than rated capacities due to changes in refinery operation and the type of crude oil available for processing.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2021 
 Improved refinery throughput in 2021 primarily reflects reduced impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by a planned turnaround at Strathcona. 
 2020 
 Lower throughput was driven by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower refinery turnaround activity and reliability events, including impacts from the Sarnia fractionation tower incident which occurred in April 2019. 
 Distribution 
 The company maintains a nationwide distribution system, to move petroleum products to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates fuel terminals across the country, as well as natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of two products pipeline companies.

  Marketing 
 The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products to the motoring public through Esso and Mobil-branded sites and independent marketers. At the end of 2021, there were about 2,400 sites operating under a branded wholesaler model whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and operate sites in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards. 
 Imperial also sells petroleum products, including fuel, asphalt and lubricants, to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers, as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded fuel and lubricant resellers. 
 The approximate daily volumes of net petroleum products (excluding purchases / sales contracts with the same counterparty) sold during the three years ended December 31, 2021, are set out in the following table. 
 

thousands of barrels per day | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Gasolines | 224 | 215 | 249 
Heating, diesel and jet fuels | 160 | 146 | 167 
Heavy fuel oils | 27 | 20 | 21 
Lube oils and other products | 45 | 40 | 38 
Net petroleum product sales | 456 | 421 | 475 


In 2021, improved petroleum product sales primarily reflects reduced impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 In 2020, lower sales were primarily driven by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Chemical 
 The company’s Chemical operations manufacture and market benzene, aromatic and aliphatic solvents, plasticizer intermediates and polyethylene resin. Its petrochemical and polyethylene manufacturing operations are located in Sarnia, Ontario, adjacent to the company’s petroleum refinery. 
 The company’s total petrochemical sales volumes during the three years ended December 31, 2021, were as follows. 
 

thousands of tonnes | 2021 | 2020 | 2019
Total petrochemical sales | 831 | 749 | 732 


In 2021, sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales of intermediates and aromatics. 
 In 2020, sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales of intermediates.

  Human capital resources 
 Imperial operates in a complex, competitive and changing business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the company’s philosophy on talent development. 
 Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. The company’s compensation is market competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by individual performance. In addition, benefits and workplace programs support the company’s talent management approach, and are designed to attract and retain employees for a long-term career. Overall, this multifaceted approach has resulted in strong employee retention. 
 Imperial views diversity as an opportunity. The company encourages and respects diversity of thought, ideas, and perspective in its workforce. The company considers diversity through all stages of employment including recruitment, training and development of its employees. Imperial’s goal is to reflect the mix and diversity of the communities where it operates, and it continues to focus on diverse representation at all levels of the organization. 
 The number of regular employees was about 5,400 at the end of 2021 (2020 - 5,800, 2019 - 6,000). Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full-time or part-time for the company and are covered by the company’s benefit plans and programs. 
 Competition 
 The Canadian energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The energy and petrochemical industries also compete with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. Certain industry participants, including Imperial, are expanding investments in lower-emission energy and emission-reduction services and technologies.

  Government regulations 
 Petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights 
 Most of the company’s petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights, in the form of leases or licences, are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum, natural gas and / or oil sands on the leased lands for a specified period. 
 In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 
 The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 
 Project approval 
 Approvals and licences from relevant provincial or federal governmental or regulatory bodies are required for the company to carry out, or make modifications to, its oil and gas activities. The project approval process for major projects can involve, among other things, environmental assessments (including relevant mitigation measures), stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and input regarding project concerns, and public hearings. Approval may be subject to various conditions and commitments arising through these processes. 
 In 2019, the Canadian government implemented a new environmental assessment framework in Canada under the Impact Assessment Act (IAA), which may impact the manner in which large energy projects are approved. The IAA includes broader consideration for social, health, and gender-based impacts, the impact on Canada’s climate change commitments (including a requirement under the Strategic Assessment for Climate Change to provide a credible plan for the project to deliver net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050), reliance on strategic and regional assessments and adjusted regulatory review timelines. 
 Environmental protection 
 The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations as a priority. The company is subject to extensive environmental regulations in Canada that apply to all phases of exploration, development, operation, and final closure. These requirements cover the management and monitoring of potential environmental impacts during active operations, including practices for land disturbance, wildlife protection, specifications for equipment operation and material storage and limitations on discharges to the environment. It also includes conducting environmental surveys and collecting continuous operational measurements and sampling to confirm that environmental practices are adequately protecting the environment. These regulations also specify the actions and requirements for final reclamation, abandonment and closure of facilities. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. The company also maintains extensive operating procedures, processes and emergency response plans to address environmental risks at its operations. 
 As discussed in Item 1A. “Risk factors” in this report, compliance with existing and potential future government regulations, including environmental regulations, may have material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the company. Imperial takes new and ongoing measures throughout its operations each year to prevent and minimize the impact of its operations on air, land and water. These include significant investments in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, continued evaluation and implementation of new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adherence to federal and provincial greenhouse gas emissions reduction and reporting programs, enhanced water and land management, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about $3.7 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2021, the company’s environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately $1.1 billion, which was spent primarily on activities to protect the air, land and water, including remediation projects. Capital and operating expenditures relating to environmental protection are expected to be about $1.0 billion in 2022.

  Crude oil 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 
 Additionally, the Government of Alberta has in the past used temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations to impose production limits on large producers in Alberta. Mandatory production curtailments were implemented in January 2019 and eliminated in December 2020. By the end of 2021, the regulatory authority to impose curtailments was repealed. 
 Exports 
 Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require the prior approval of the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) and the Government of Canada. Export contracts of less than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require an order from the CER. 
 Natural gas 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on Imperial’s 2021 gas production rates. 
Exports 
 The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas. Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the CER and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by CER order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months. 
Royalties 
 The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas, impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 
 Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude, see “Upstream” section entitled “Present activities” under Item 1 on page 13.

  Investment Canada Act 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 
 The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canada’s cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. 
 By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by ExxonMobil, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 
 Competition Act 
 The Competition Bureau seeks to ensure that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have, or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 
 An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. An ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.
