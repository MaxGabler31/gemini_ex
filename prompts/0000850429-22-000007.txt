Item 1.    BUSINESS
Description of Business
Tredegar Corporation (“Tredegar”) is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the manufacture of aluminum extrusions, polyethylene (“PE”) plastic films and polyester (“PET”) films. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references herein to “Tredegar,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are to Tredegar Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Company's reportable business segments are Aluminum Extrusions, PE Films and Flexible Packaging Films.
On October 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of its personal care films business (“Personal Care Films”). The transaction excluded the packaging film lines and related operations located at the Pottsville, Pennsylvania manufacturing site (“Pottsville Packaging”), which are now being reported within the Surface Protection component of PE Films. Commencing in the third quarter of 2020, all historical results for Personal Care Films have been presented as discontinued operations. 
In December 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and completed the sale of Bright View Technologies (“Bright View”). The sale did not represent a strategic shift nor did it have a major effect on the Company’s historical and ongoing operations, thus all financial information for Bright View has been presented as continuing operations within the PE Films segment.
For more information on these transactions, see Note 15 “Discontinued Operations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15. “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” (“Item 15”) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“Form 10-K”).

In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Aluminum Extrusions net sales accounted for approximately 67%, 63% and 66% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales, respectively.
Backlog. Overall backlog in Aluminum Extrusions was approximately $306.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared to approximately $74.2 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of $232.2 million, or approximately 313%. The increased backlog in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to increased demand (33% increase in bookings), while experiencing a shortage of labor to meet existing demand and desired shipment levels. Net sales for Aluminum Extrusions, which the Company believes are cyclical in nature due to the seasonal nature of end-use markets, were $539.3 million in 2021, $455.7 million in 2020 and $529.6 million in 2019. 
Raw Materials. The primary raw materials used by Aluminum Extrusions consist of aluminum ingot, aluminum scrap and various alloys, which are purchased from domestic and foreign producers in open-market purchases and under annual contracts. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K (“Item 7”) for additional information on aluminum price trends. Aluminum Extrusions believes that it has adequate supply agreements for aluminum raw materials in 2022 and is in the process of securing supply sources to meet expected needs in 2023. Aluminum Extrusions continues to navigate through supply chain issues for paint and other non-aluminum raw materials.
PE Films
PE Films produces surface protection films, polyethylene overwrap films and films for other markets. Tredegar’s Surface Protection unit produces single- and multi-layer surface protection films sold under the UltraMask®, ForceField™, ForceField PEARL® and Pearl A™ brand names. These films, which are manufactured at facilities in the U.S. and China, support manufacturers of optical and other specialty substrates used in high-technology applications, most notably protecting high-value components of flat panel and flexible displays used in televisions, monitors, notebooks, smartphones, tablets, e-readers, automobiles and digital signage, during the manufacturing and transportation process. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, PE Films accounted for approximately 15%, 19% and 17% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales, respectively.
In October 2020, the Surface Protection unit assumed responsibility for Pottsville Packaging, which was previously reported within the Personal Care component of PE Films. Pottsville Packaging produces thin-gauge films as overwrap for bathroom tissue and paper towels. 
Raw Materials. The primary raw materials used by PE Films are polyethylene and polypropylene resins. These raw materials are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices. Refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7 for additional information on resin price trends. PE Films believes that there will be an adequate supply of polyethylene and polypropylene resins in the foreseeable future. 
Research and Development. Tredegar’s spending for research and development (“R&D”) activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was primarily related to PE Films. R&D spending by the PE Films was approximately $5.7 million, $7.7 million and $7.0 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Customers. PE Films’ products are sold primarily in the U.S. and Asia, with the top four customers, collectively, comprising 88%, 84% and 86% of its net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No single PE Films customer exceeds 10% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales. For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K (“Item 1A”).
Flexible Packaging Films
Flexible Packaging Films is comprised of Terphane Holdings LLC (“Terphane”). Flexible Packaging Films produces PET-based films for use in packaging applications that have specialized properties, such as heat resistance, strength, barrier protection and the ability to accept high-quality print graphics. These differentiated, high-value films are primarily manufactured in Brazil and sold in Latin America and the U.S. under the Terphane®, Sealphane® and Ecophane® brand names. Major end uses include food packaging and industrial applications. Flexible Packaging Films competes in all of its markets on the basis of product quality, service and price. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Terphane accounted for approximately 18%, 18% and 17% of Tredegar’s consolidated net sales, respectively.
Raw Materials. The primary raw materials used by Flexible Packaging Films to produce polyester resins are purified terephthalic acid (“PTA”) and monoethylene glycol (“MEG”). Flexible Packaging Films also purchases additional polyester resins directly from suppliers. These raw materials are obtained from Brazilian and foreign suppliers at competitive prices. Terphane continues to monitor cost escalations to adjust selling prices as market dynamics permit and believes that there will be an adequate supply of polyester resins, PTA and MEG in the foreseeable future. 
General
Intellectual Property. Tredegar considers patents, licenses and trademarks to be material to PE Films. On December 31, 2021, PE Films held 40 patents (including 5 U.S. patents), and 79 registered trademarks (including 4 U.S. registered trademarks). Flexible Packaging Films held 1 U.S. patent and 17 registered trademarks (including 4 U.S. registered trademarks). Aluminum Extrusions held no U.S. patents and 4 U.S. registered trademarks. As of December 31, 2021, these patents had remaining terms of 2.5 to 17.5 years. 
Government Regulation. The Company’s operations are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign government regulations, including environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations.
U.S. laws concerning the environment to which the Company’s domestic operations are or may be subject to include the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), regulations promulgated under these acts, and other federal, state or local laws or regulations governing environmental matters. Compliance with these laws is an important consideration because Tredegar uses hazardous materials in some of its operations, is a generator of hazardous waste, and wastewater from the Company’s operations is discharged to various types of wastewater management systems. Under CERCLA and other laws, Tredegar may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with waste management and disposal, even if the Company fully complies with applicable environmental laws.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act relating to emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including mandatory reporting and permitting requirements. Several of the Company’s manufacturing operations result in emissions of carbon dioxide or GHG and are subject to the current GHG regulations. The Company’s compliance with environmental regulations has yet to require significant capital expenditures; however, environmental standards tend to become more stringent over time. Therefore, in order to comply with current or future environmental legislation or regulations, the Company may be subject to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but which could be significant, including constructing new facilities or modifying existing facilities.
Like environmental regulations, current or future privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation or regulations may subject the Company to additional capital expenditures, operating expenses or other compliance costs, the amounts and timing of which are not presently determinable but could be significant. Any failure to comply with current or future laws and regulations, including environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, could subject Tredegar to substantial penalties, fines, costs and expenses. For further discussion regarding certain environmental, privacy and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, see Item 1A below.
Human Capital Management. 
Overview
Tredegar employed approximately 2,400 people at December 31, 2021 located in the U.S., Brazil, and Asia, of which 80% are located in the U.S. Approximately 15% of the Company’s employees are represented by labor unions located in the U.S. under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates, none of which expire before 2025. All of Tredegar’s Brazilian employees are represented by a national labor union. Generally, the total number of employees of Tredegar does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition or divestiture activity, or changes in the level of business activity may impact employee levels. 
Health and Safety
Tredegar has continuously exceeded the industry standards for safety. The Company uses various forms of employee safety metrics to assess the health and safety performance of its Aluminum Extrusions, PE Films and Flexible Packaging operations, including employee safety data which is available on the Company’s website at https://tredegar.com/about-tredegar/committed-to-our-employees. Tredegar has also instituted additional safety precautions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as described in "The Impact of COVID-19" included in Item 7.
Additionally, Aluminum Extrusions has on-site health clinics at its Carthage and Clearfield facilities. These clinics allow Aluminum Extrusions to invest in its people, provide more personal and more thorough healthcare to employees, and enhance the employer-employee relationship. The Carthage and Clearfield clinics serve over 540 and 380 employees, respectively. 
Talent and Development
The Company believes its employees are its most valuable asset and are critical to the success of the Company. The Company seeks to retain employees by offering competitive wages, benefits and training opportunities. To assess and monitor employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees and takes actions to address areas of employee concern. The annual employee engagement survey results are presented to Tredegar’s Board of Directors (“Board”). Additionally, the objectives of our executive compensation programs are to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers. To accomplish these objectives, the Company relies on a pay strategy that emphasizes performance-based compensation through annual and long-term incentives. The Company believes that this pay strategy creates a strong link between pay and performance and aligns with our business strategy of generating strong operating results and shareholder value creation while controlling fixed costs. 
The Company is committed to holistically supporting our employees both at work and in their communities by:
•Strictly following all applicable health, safety and non-discrimination laws in each country;
•Promoting the highest standards for employee health and safety through innovative programs; and 
•Providing opportunities for community outreach and supporting programs that enhance the lives of children and families.
Inclusion and Diversity
Tredegar strictly complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location where Tredegar and its businesses have facilities to ensure healthy and positive working conditions. This applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, job assignments, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, pregnancy, national origin, ethnicity, political affiliation, union membership, marital status, citizenship status, veteran status, disability or other protected category. Employees who experience or witness discriminatory behavior are encouraged to report such behavior to their supervisor, Human Resources or Tredegar’s toll-free anonymous reporting hotline. Additionally, the Company spends significant resources in developing its employees. Among the five core principles of the “The Tredegar Way” that the Company uses to guide its organization, the “Leadership” principle is focused on building a team of motivated and engaged leaders at every level of the Company. Each business unit has identified specific action plans to promote the Leadership principle among its employees. Action plans include talent development, skills training, reinforcement of strong cultural values, and robust systems to ensure a safe working environment.
