ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the term "Company," except as otherwise indicated by the context, means Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries for which it has a controlling interest. The Lincoln Electric Company began operations in 1895 and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1906. During 1998, The Lincoln Electric Company reorganized into a holding company structure, and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. became the publicly-held parent of Lincoln Electric subsidiaries worldwide, including The Lincoln Electric Company.
The Company is one of only a few worldwide broad-line manufacturers of welding, cutting and brazing products. The Company is the world leader in the design, development and manufacture of arc welding products, automated joining, assembly and cutting systems, plasma and oxy-fuel cutting equipment. The Company also has a leading global position in brazing and soldering alloys.
The Company’s products include arc welding power sources, plasma cutters, wire feeding systems, robotic welding packages, integrated automation systems, fume extraction equipment, consumable electrodes, fluxes and welding accessories and specialty welding consumables and fabrication. The Company’s product offering also includes computer numeric controlled ("CNC") plasma and oxy-fuel cutting systems and regulators and torches used in oxy-fuel welding, cutting and brazing.
The arc welding power sources and wire feeding systems manufactured by the Company range in technology from basic units used for light manufacturing and maintenance to highly sophisticated robotic applications for high volume production welding and fabrication. Three primary types of arc welding electrodes are produced: (1) coated manual or stick electrodes; (2) solid electrodes produced in coil, reel or drum forms for continuous feeding in mechanized welding; and (3) cored electrodes produced in coil form for continuous feeding in mechanized welding.
The Company has, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom.
The Company’s business units are aligned into three operating segments. The operating segments consist of Americas Welding, International Welding and The Harris Products Group. The Americas Welding segment includes welding operations in North and South America. The International Welding segment includes welding operations in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The Harris Products Group includes the Company’s global cutting, soldering and brazing businesses, as well as the retail business in the United States.
Customers
The Company’s products are sold in both domestic and international markets. In the Americas, products are sold principally through industrial distributors, retailers and also directly to users of welding products. Outside of the Americas, the Company has an international sales organization comprised of Company employees and agents who sell products from the Company’s various manufacturing sites to distributors and product users.

The Company is not dependent on a single customer or a few customers and no individual customer currently accounts for more than ten percent of total Net sales. However, the loss of a large customer could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The arc welding and cutting industry is generally a mature industry in developed markets such as North America and Western Europe and is cyclical in nature. Overall demand for arc welding and cutting products is largely determined by economic cycles and the level of capital spending in manufacturing and other industrial sectors. The Company experiences some variability in reported period-to-period results as demand for the Company’s products are mildly seasonal with generally higher demand in the second and third quarters. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for further discussion regarding risks associated with customers, general economic conditions and demand.
Competition
Conditions in the arc welding and cutting industry are highly competitive. The Company believes it is the world’s largest manufacturer of consumables and equipment with relatively few major broad-line competitors worldwide, but numerous smaller competitors in specific geographic markets. The Company continues to pursue strategies to heighten its competitiveness in domestic and international markets, which includes positioning low cost manufacturing facilities in most geographical markets. Competition in the arc welding and cutting industry is based on brand preference, product quality, price, performance, warranty, delivery, service and technical support. The Company believes its performance against these factors has contributed to the Company’s position as the leader in the industry.
Most of the Company’s products may be classified as standard commercial articles and are manufactured for stock. The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of its highly trained technical sales force and the support of its welding research and development staff to assist customers in optimizing their welding applications. This allows the Company to introduce its products to new users and to establish and maintain close relationships with its customers. This close relationship between the technical sales force and the direct customers, together with its supportive relationship with its distributors, who are particularly interested in handling the broad range of the Company’s products, is an important element of the Company’s market success and a valuable asset of the Company.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials essential to the Company’s business are steel, electronic components, engines, brass, copper, silver, aluminum alloys, robotic components and various chemicals, all of which are normally available for purchase in the open market.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company holds many valuable patents, primarily in arc welding, and actively protects its innovations as research and development has progressed in both the United States and major international jurisdictions. The Company believes its trademarks are an important asset and aggressively pursues brand management.
