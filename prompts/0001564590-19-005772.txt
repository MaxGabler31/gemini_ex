ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.® (the “Company” or “we” or “our” or “us”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in the areas of thrombosis, other hematologic diseases and inflammation for patients who currently have limited or no approved treatment options. Our headquarters are located in South San Francisco, California.
 Our lead product is Andexxa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo], the first and only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Bevyxxa (betrixaban), the first and only oral, once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor approved by the FDA for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (“VTE”) in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness, is currently being marketed in a limited manner and we are evaluating potential partnership opportunities for this product. We are advancing cerdulatinib, an investigational oral, dual spleen tyrosine kinase (“Syk”) and Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor in development to treat hematologic cancers. We also have a number of other molecules in earlier stage and pre-clinical development.

 Our strategy 
 We are building a global, fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. In 2018, we launched two commercial products in the United States: Andexxa and Bevyxxa. In May 2018, we received FDA approval for Andexxa, which allowed us to launch an Early Supply Program in the United States using limited quantities of drug manufactured under our clinical-scale process. On December 31, 2018, we received approval from the FDA to sell product manufactured using our commercial-scale process, and in January 2019, we commenced a full United States Andexxa launch. On March 1, 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) communicated a positive opinion for conditional marketing approval of Andexxa in the EU, to be marketed under the brand name Ondexxya. Based on the positive CHMP opinion, we anticipate the European Commission (“EC”) decision in the second quarter of 2019, although the CHMP vote is not binding on the EC and there can be no assurances that the EC will provide such decision. In January 2018, we launched our first commercial product, Bevyxxa, in the United States. In March 2018, the CHMP issued a negative opinion, recommending that the EMA reject the marketing application for Bevyxxa in the EU. We requested a re-examination of the initial opinion and in

July 2018, we received a negative re-examination opinion from the CHMP. The European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in September 2018. While we continue to evaluate paths for the potential approval of Bevyxxa in the EU, there are currently no applications for Bevyxxa pending before the EU regulatory authorities. Commencing in the second half of 2018, we made the decision to prioritize our resources toward the Andexxa launch and reduced marketing efforts for Bevyxxa.
 During 2018 and early 2019 we hired key executive management team members, including the following:
  
• | Scott Garland, President and Chief Executive Officer;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Ernie Meyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Glenn Brame, Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Operations Officer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | John Moriarty, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sheldon Koenig, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Key elements of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | Pursue and prioritize the commercial launch of Andexxa in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategically scale up our field force and increase engagement with medical, scientific and academic professionals and associations to establish Andexxa as the standard of care for life threatening bleeds;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obtain regulatory approval of Andexxa in the EU and pursue a commercial launch through either our own efforts or with the assistance of a marketing partner;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue additional regulatory approvals for Andexxa, including reversal of additional anticoagulants such as edoxaban and enoxaparin, and reversal of Factor Xa inhibitors for emergency surgery/urgent procedures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish and improve reimbursement and market access for Andexxa;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support our commercial marketing partners Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company (“BMS”) and Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) to advance development of Andexxa for the Japanese market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue limited focused commercial efforts for Bevyxxa in the United States while pursuing and evaluating other strategic options for Bevyxxa;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance development of cerdulatinib into registration studies for the treatment of hematologic cancers while considering partnering opportunities for cerdulatinib; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to advance our current development pipeline and expand it with multiple preclinical or clinical stage product candidates that align with our scientific expertise and experience.

Approved Products 
 Andexxa
 Andexxa is approved by the FDA as a reversal agent for patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Andexxa was approved under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval pathway based on the change from baseline in anti-Factor Xa activity in healthy volunteers. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon post-marketing study results to demonstrate an improvement in hemostasis in patients. 
 We have also submitted a centralized Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for Andexxa under the proposed brand name Ondexxya to the European Union’s European Medicines Agency (“EMA”).  On March 1, 2019, the CHMP communicated a positive opinion for Conditional Approval of the MAA. Based on the positive CHMP opinion, we expect an EC decision in the second quarter of 2019, although the CHMP opinion is not binding on the EC and there can be no assurances that the EC will provide such decision.  We expect the EC decision for Conditional Approval, if obtained, will include several post-authorization requirements, including specific 
 
5


obligations to submit a final clinical study report for the randomized controlled trial of Andexxa (US)/Ondexxya (EU), a final clinical study report for the ANNEXA-4 study, and an obligation to provide some additional pharmacokinetic data. 
 In the U.S., we initially received approval from the FDA in May 2018 to market product manufactured under our Gen 1 process using the clinical-scale process at the facility that produced material for our clinical trials. We conducted a limited launch in the second half of 2018 through an Early Supply Program (“ESP”) intended to reach hospitals with a large number of patients with Factor Xa bleeds and able to start using Andexxa during the ESP period. On December 31, 2018, the FDA approved our Gen 2 manufacturing process, which provides commercial scale volume that we believe is sufficient to support a global launch that can meet worldwide commercial demand for at least the next several years. In early January 2019, we began shipping Gen 2 product and commenced a full-scale commercial launch in the United States. If approved in the EU, we will launch using Gen 2 product.
 The worldwide use of Factor Xa inhibitors is rapidly growing because of their efficacy and safety profile compared to warfarin and enoxaparin in preventing and treating thromboembolic conditions such as stroke, pulmonary embolism and VTE. This growth has come with a proportional increase in the incidence of hospital admissions and deaths related to bleeding, the major complication of anticoagulation. In 2017, in the U.S. alone, there were approximately 149,000 hospital admissions attributable to Factor Xa inhibitor-related bleeding. We believe that Andexxa has the potential to act as a universal reversal agent for all direct and indirect Factor Xa inhibitors. We plan to continue clinical development to support global approvals as a reversal agent for other Factor Xa inhibitors. In addition, we plan to continue clinical development to support global approvals for reversal of the anticoagulant effects in Factor Xa inhibitor-treated patients who require emergency surgery/urgent procedures.
 Andexxa was granted an Accelerated Approval by the FDA with a requirement for a post-marketing study to verify and describe Andexxa’s clinical benefit via an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of Andexxa in acute intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving oral Factor Xa inhibitors. This trial was initiated in early 2019 and we anticipate that it will include approximately 440 patients and compare outcomes of patients treated with Andexxa to the usual care on a 1:1 randomized scheme. We expect to conduct this study globally over approximately four years. 
 In August 2018, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) granted a New Technology Add-on Payment (“NTAP”) for Andexxa. Under the NTAP, Medicare will provide an add-on payment for Andexxa of up to approximately $14,000 per qualifying case to participating acute care hospitals. This add-on payment will be incremental to the diagnosis related group reimbursement for qualifying Medicare inpatient cases. The NTAP for Andexxa became effective October 1, 2018, and is expected to remain in effect for a period of two to three years.  
 In February 2019, we announced full results from ANNEXA-4, our Phase 3b/4 trial of Andexxa in patients experiencing acute major bleeding while taking a Factor Xa inhibitor. Data were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation at the International Stroke Conference 2019 and published simultaneously online by The New England Journal of Medicine (“NEJM”). Full data from 352 patients (249 of which were evaluable for hemostatic efficacy; all 352 were evaluable for safety) showed that Andexxa rapidly and significantly reversed anti-Factor Xa activity when administered as a bolus, and sustained this reversal when followed by a 120-minute infusion. Anti-Factor Xa activity is a measure of the anticoagulant activity of apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and enoxaparin, the anticoagulants studied in ANNEXA-4. Among all 352 patients, 64 percent (n=227) were treated for intracranial hemorrhage (“ICH”) and 26 percent (n=90) were treated for a gastrointestinal bleed. Of those evaluated for efficacy 82 percent (n=204) achieved excellent or good hemostasis (stoppage of bleeding) over the 12-hour period following treatment with Andexxa, as determined by an independent adjudication committee.
 Within 30 days of enrollment, thrombotic events occurred in 34 patients (9.7 percent) and death occurred in 49 patients (13.9 percent), consistent with previously presented ANNEXA-4 trial results and with the high background thrombotic risk of the enrolled patient population. The majority of thrombotic events occurred in patients who delayed or did not re-start anticoagulation therapy with a Factor Xa inhibitor during the follow-up period. Among the 100 patients who re-started oral anticoagulation therapy, no thrombotic events were observed. Two patients experienced an infusion reaction and none developed antibodies to Factor Xa or Factor X or neutralizing antibodies to Andexxa.

We hold worldwide commercial rights to Andexxa with the exception of Japan. In 2016, we entered into collaboration agreements with BMS and Pfizer whereby BMS and Pfizer will seek to obtain Japanese regulatory approval and to commercialize Andexxa in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million and are eligible to receive potential regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to $90.0 million, as well as tiered single-digit to double-digit royalties based on net sales in Japan. BMS and Pfizer obtained the rights to develop and commercialize Andexxa in Japan and will be responsible for all development, regulatory and commercialization activities. Under the terms of the agreement, BMS and Pfizer will purchase drug from us at cost for both clinical studies and, upon approval, commercial sales in Japan.
 Bevyxxa
 Bevyxxa is the first and only anticoagulant approved in the U.S. for hospital and extended duration prophylaxis (35 to 42 days) of VTE in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE. Bevyxxa was approved by the FDA in June 2017 and we commenced the commercial launch in the U.S. in January 2018.
 Acutely ill medical patients are those hospitalized for serious medical conditions, including heart failure, stroke, infection and pulmonary disease. Because of their underlying disorder and immobilization, they are at increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (“DVT”) and pulmonary embolism (“PE”) blood clots. In the G7 countries, an estimated 24 million acutely ill medical patients are hospitalized each year and are at risk of VTE, either while in the hospital or following discharge. More than one million VTE events and 150,000 VTE-related deaths occur annually in acutely ill medical patients in the G7 countries, despite the standard use of injectable enoxaparin and other heparins in the hospital. More than half of VTE events occur after patients are discharged from the hospital. No other anticoagulant, including enoxaparin or any of the marketed oral Factor Xa inhibitors, is approved for in-hospital and extended-duration VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.
 In March 2018, the CHMP issued a negative opinion, recommending that the EMA reject the marketing application for Bevyxxa in the EU. We requested a re-examination of the initial opinion and in July 2018, we received a negative re-examination opinion from the CHMP. The EC adopted the CHMP decision in September 2018. While we continue to evaluate paths for the potential approval of Bevyxxa in the EU, there are currently no applications for Bevyxxa pending before the EU regulatory authorities.
 We believe that Bevyxxa has significant commercial potential. We anticipate it will require significant additional effort and more resources than we currently have to drive adoption and market acceptance. Following the approval of Andexxa in May 2018, due to our limited resources, we greatly scaled back our commercial efforts for Bevyxxa in the second half of 2018 in order to focus on the commercial launch of Andexxa. We are re-evaluating our marketing strategy for Bevyxxa and also exploring potential partnership and other strategic options for Bevyxxa.
 Product Candidates:
 Cerdulatinib
 Cerdulatinib is our investigational oral, dual spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitor that uniquely inhibits two key cell signaling pathways implicated in certain hematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases. There is a rationale for inhibiting both Syk (B-cell receptor pathway) and JAK (cytokine receptors) in B-cell malignancies where both targets have been shown to promote cancer cell growth and survival. In addition, pre-clinical data suggest an important role for Syk and JAK in Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (“PTCL”) tumor survival.
 There is a significant unmet need for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL. Current approved therapies for relapsed/refractory PTCL are all given via IV infusion and have limited activity with overall response rates of approximately 30%.  In addition, most of these responses are partial responses.  Based on the unmet need and on the activity to date with cerdulatinib, we have prioritized development in PTCL. Following our End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in January 2019, the FDA has requested additional data supporting the proposed dose, which we are in the process of submitting. Pending the outcome of our discussions, we hope to start a registrational

study. In addition, we remain focused on development in CTCL and Follicular Lymphoma and are exploring potential paths to approval in these diseases.
 The FDA granted cerdulatinib Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of PTCL in September 2018. The FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development grants orphan status to support development of medicines for the treatment of rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation may provide certain benefits, including a seven-year period of market exclusivity if the drug is approved, tax credits for qualified clinical trials and an exemption from FDA market application fees. In December 2018, we presented updated interim data from the ongoing Phase 2a study at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Highlights of this data included the following: 
  
• | The objective response rate (“ORR”) was 34 percent in the PTCL cohort and 26 percent in the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”) cohort.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Among the subset of patients in the PTCL cohort with Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (“AITL”), the ORR was 57 percent.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For the PTCL cohort, eleven of 41 patients (27 percent) achieved a complete response (“CR”), and three patients (7 percent) achieved a partial response (“PR”); in the subgroup of 14 patients with AITL, seven patients (50 percent) achieved a CR and one patient (7 percent) achieved a PR; one patient who achieved a CR went on to transplant; and eight responding patients have remained on drug for three to more than 12 months and five patients have had a duration of response of six months or greater.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the CTCL cohort, two patients (7 percent) achieved a CR and five patients (19 percent) achieved a PR; responses have been seen in patients with Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome; eleven of 23 patients (48 percent) achieved a ≥ 50 percent reduction in skin lesions, based on the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (“mSWAT”); and rapid improvements in pruritus, or severe itching – a common and often serious condition associated with CTCL – have been observed, as measured by the Likert scale.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cerdulatinib has demonstrated tolerability in both PTCL and CTCL. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events across the PTCL and CTCL cohorts with a frequency > 5 percent were lipase increase (23 percent), amylase increase (18 percent), sepsis/bacteremia (8 percent), and neutropenia, pneumonia/lung infection and diarrhea (7 percent each).
 In December 2016, we licensed worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of cerdulatinib in topical applications beyond oncology to Dermavant Sciences GmbH (“Dermavant”). We retain full rights to all non-topical formulations, including oral formulations.  Dermavant has presented positive Phase 1 results with topical cerdulatinib in atopic dermatitis patients.
 Other Early Stage Programs
 We have other early research and development programs including an exclusive in-license agreement with SRX Cardio LLC to explore a novel approach to developing a drug in the field of hypercholesterolemia and a collaboration with Ora for the topical Syk inhibitor PRT2761.  PRT2761 was recently evaluated in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis where it met one of the two primary endpoints for the study.  Based on these study results, we and Ora are currently exploring the potential to pursue PRT2761 in dry eye and other ocular inflammatory diseases. 
 Sales and marketing 
 We target our U.S. sales and marketing efforts at the approximately 1,500 hospitals and out-patient acute care settings that would account for the large majority of the prescribing base for Andexxa. We market Andexxa in the United States using a hospital-based sales force of approximately 118 sales representatives. This sales force is supported by an experienced sales leadership team of regional sales managers and account managers, and our commercial team comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, marketing research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. Following approval in the EU, we plan to launch in a limited number of countries and also consider potential collaborations. To achieve 
 
8


global commercialization, we anticipate using a variety of distribution agreements and commercial partnerships in those territories where we do not establish our own sales force. 
 Customers
 Our products are purchased in the United States primarily by hospital purchasers. These hospitals purchase our products through a network of specialty and wholesale distributors. We do not believe that the loss of one of these distributors would significantly impact the ability to distribute our product as we expect that sales volume would be absorbed by the remaining distributors.
Other Key Licenses and Collaborations 
 As part of our business strategy, we establish collaborations with other companies, universities and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical development and/or commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies, universities and medical research institutions. For more information regarding certain of these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business, see Notes 3 and 8, Revenue Recognition and Asset Acquisition and License Agreements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Andexxa
  
• | BMS and Pfizer
--+---------------

 In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with BMS and Pfizer to further study Andexxa as a reversal agent for their jointly-owned, FDA-approved oral Factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, through Phase 3 studies. We are responsible for the cost of conducting this clinical study. Pursuant to our agreement with BMS and Pfizer, we are obligated to provide research, development and regulatory approval services and participate in the Joint Collaboration Committee.
 In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with BMS and Pfizer whereby BMS and Pfizer obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Andexxa in Japan. BMS and Pfizer are responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities in Japan and we will reimburse BMS and Pfizer for expenses they incur for research and development activities specific to Factor Xa inhibitors other than apixaban. Pursuant to this agreement, we are obligated to provide certain research and development activities outside of Japan, provide clinical drug supply and related manufacturing services and to participate on various committees in exchange for a non-refundable upfront fee of $15.0 million. We are also eligible to receive, contingent payments totaling up to $20.0 million which may be earned upon achievement of certain regulatory events and up to $70.0 million which may be earned upon achievement of specified annual net sales volumes in Japan. We are also entitled to receive royalties ranging from 5% to 15% on net sales of Andexxa in Japan. As provided in this agreement, we have agreed to provide Andexxa at cost in order to supply clinical and commercial demand in Japan.
  
• | Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (“Daiichi Sankyo”)
--+----------------------------------------

 In 2013, we entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to include subjects dosed with edoxaban, its Factor Xa inhibitor product, in one of our Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies of Andexxa. In July 2014, we entered into a second collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to perform the necessary development and regulatory activities to support potential U.S. and EU regulatory approval of andexanet alfa as a reversal agent for edoxaban. Under this Phase 3 collaboration agreement we received an upfront payment of $15.0 million. So far, we have received $5 million in milestone payments and are eligible to receive additional development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $2.5 million. In 2016, we amended the 2014 agreement to expedite development activities in exchange for $15.0 million and a net increase in total

Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of drugs that are safer, more efficacious and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies. 
 Andexxa 
 Currently there are no therapies approved as antidotes for Factor Xa inhibitors. However, Andexxa competes with the off-label use of treatments designed to enhance coagulation including Fresh Frozen Plasma (“FFP”), 4-factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (“PCCs”), recombinant activated Factor VII (“rFVIIa”), Vitamin K, protamine or whole blood. In addition, several companies have conducted clinical research on compounds that are intended to reverse the effects of one or more direct Factor Xa inhibitors and which, if developed, may be competitive with Andexxa. 
Bevyxxa 
 In the market for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients, Bevyxxa competes primarily with enoxaparin, which is marketed as Lovenox® by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and as a generic pharmaceutical by several manufacturers, and to a lesser extent with other low molecular weight heparins. In addition, Bevyxxa may face competition in the market for acute medically ill patients from the off-label use of other Factor Xa inhibitors. In addition, Janssen has announced its intention to pursue approval for Xarelto® for prevention of VTE in certain acute medically ill patients following hospital discharge based on the results from its Mariner and Magellan trials. 
 
10


Cerdulatinib 
 In the market for the treatment of Follicular Lymphoma (“FL”), PTCL, CTCL, and cerdulatinib, if approved, will compete with existing therapies, such as rituximab and obinutuzumab which are marketed by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. and Genentech, Inc., idelalisib, which is marketed by Gilead, brentuximab, which is marketed by Seattle Genetics, Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd,  copanlisib, which is marketed by Bayer AG, duvelisib, which is marketed by Verastem, Inc., romidepsin, which is marketed by Celgene Corporation, pralatrexate and belinostat, which are marketed by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., mogamulizumab, which is marketed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin; and potentially other therapies currently in development by a number of different companies.
 Intellectual property
 Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our drug candidates, including composition-of-matter, dosage and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see the section of this Report entitled “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.” 
 Andexanet alfa 
 Our Factor Xa inhibitor antidote patent portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes 12 issued U.S. patents and ten U.S. patent applications covering the composition of and methods of making and using andexanet alfa or its analogs.  We retain full commercialization rights to andexanet alfa on a worldwide basis except for Japan where commercial rights have been licensed to BMS and Pfizer.
 The last to expire of the U.S. patents relating to the composition of matter is not expected to expire before June 2030. Related international patent applications have issued in 44 countries, and additional related international patent applications are pending. These international patents and patent applications, if issued, would not be due to expire before September 2028. Several other international patent applications have issued in Europe, Japan, and other countries, and international patent applications are still pending in Europe and a number of other countries.
 Betrixaban 
 Our betrixaban patent portfolio includes 24 issued U.S. patents and eight U.S. patent applications covering the composition of and methods of making and using betrixaban or its analogs, including those owned by us and those licensed from Millennium. The U.S. issued patents relating to the composition of matter of betrixaban are not due to expire before September 2020 and may be extended up to September 2025, if betrixaban receives the patent term extension we have timely petitioned with the U.S. Patent Office, pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Related international patent applications have issued in 38 countries. These related international patents would not be due to expire before September 2020. 
 
11


In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years for one patent related to an approved therapy. We believe that we are eligible for a full five-year patent term extension for one patent relating to betrixaban. 
 In addition, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides that the period of patent exclusivity for a drug may be extended for six months if the owner of the drug conducts studies of the drug in children pursuant to a request from the FDA. We have commenced a pediatric study of bextrixaban in the United States.
 Cerdulatinib 
 Our dual Syk-JAK inhibitor patent portfolio is owned in part by us and licensed in part from Astellas and includes six issued U.S. patents covering the composition of and methods of making and using cerdulatinib or its analogs. The last to expire of the U.S. patents is not expected to expire before July 2029. Related international patent applications have issued in 51 countries and a related patent application is pending in Brazil. These international patents and patent applications, if issued, would not be due to expire before April 2029. 
Trademarks
 We plan to market all of our products under a trademark or trademarks we select and we will own all rights, title and interest, including goodwill, associated with such trademarks. In the U.S., Andexxa, Annexa, Bevyxxa and Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are our registered trademarks. Trademark registration is pending for Ondexxya in the U.S. and has been registered in the EU. Andexxa and Ondexxya are our registered trademarks in Japan.
Manufacturing 
 We rely exclusively on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture our drugs and drug candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive U.S. and foreign regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that our current agreements and purchase orders with third-party manufacturers provide for sufficient operating capacity to support anticipated commercial and clinical supply needs for the next several years. 
Andexxa
 Andexxa is a recombinant biologic molecule produced in living cells, a process that is inherently complex and requires specialized knowledge and extensive process optimization and product characterization to transform laboratory scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes.
 Primary commercial manufacturing of Andexxa bulk drug substance is conducted at Lonza AG (“Lonza”). Drug product manufacturing is conducted at Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC (“Baxter”). We expect that future clinical studies of Andexxa will also be conducted primarily using product manufactured by these third party manufacturing organizations. We continue to sell inventory from our legacy Gen 1 clinical-scale manufacturing process during our transition of our customer base to Gen 2 manufacturing process, but do not expect to enter into any future commercial manufacturing commitments associated with that Gen 1 process or supplier. We also rely on other third-party manufacturers for packaging, testing and shipping.
 Bevyxxa
 Bevyxxa is manufactured using common chemical engineering and synthetic processes from readily available raw materials. We have relied on Hovione, Limited (“Hovione”), to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for Bevyxxa at commercial scale. We also rely on Patheon to manufacture drug product to supply Bevyxxa.

 Government regulation
 Healthcare and reimbursement regulation 
 Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with, among other laws, federal and state price reporting laws, the anti-kickback provisions of the Social Security Act and state counterparts, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, federal and state false claims laws including the federal civil False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act and federal and state transparency laws. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, and a company’s failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use. 
 Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet these applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, or integrity oversight and reporting obligations. 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products and the product candidates that we develop may not ultimately be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, “Affordable Care Act”), was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Presidential administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision. Additionally, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
 Foreign regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes and optional for those that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. For drugs without approval in a European Union member state, the decentralized procedure provides for assessment of a marketing application by one member state, known as the reference member state, and review and possible approval of that assessment by one or more other, or concerned, member states. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of related materials within 120 days after receipt the application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 Clinical Development and Marketing Approvals
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. 
 The process required by the regulatory authorities before product candidates may be marketed generally involves the following: 
  
• | nonclinical laboratory and animal testing of the product including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | submission of an investigational new drug application (“IND”) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with regulatory requirements; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval of an NDA, for a drug or a BLA, for a biologic prior to commercial marketing for specific indications for use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. For example, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”) which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. The IDMC may halt a trial if it feels that the data demonstrate efficacy of the drug and it is no longer ethical to withhold the drug from patients in the control arm of the study. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1 – Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 – Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 – Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product compared to placebo or current standard of care and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The regulatory authorities may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information gathered in routine medical practice.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with regulatory manufacturing requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must also develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to establish an appropriate shelf life for the product candidate including data demonstrating that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to continuing regulation, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the regulatory authorities and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the regulatory authorities and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory manufacturing requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we

or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with regulatory manufacturing regulations and other regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the regulatory authorities may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the marketing application. 
 Andexxa was granted an Accelerated Approval by the FDA with a requirement for a post-marketing study to verify and describe Andexxa’s clinical benefit via an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of Andexxa in acute intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving oral Factor Xa inhibitors. We expect our anticipated approval in the E.U. will also include several post-approval commitments, including an obligation to submit a final clinical study report from the randomized controlled trial of Andexxa and an obligation to provide some additional pharmacokinetic data.
