Industry Background
 We believe that expansion in our worldwide business is driven by the increased demand of subscribers and cloud service providers for mobile and fixed network access solutions and communications equipment that enable or support access to higher speed bandwidth access to the internet.
 Furthermore, increased competition between service providers for subscriber business has resulted in significant investment pressure to upgrade network infrastructure to meet growing bandwidth needs. Broadband access networks must be multiservice in nature and must have extensive quality of service guarantees in order to support 5G, mobile xHaul, symmetric business services and residential services, as well as virtual overlay networks for alternative operators and wholesale access.
 In recent years, the growth of social communications and networking has placed significant demands on legacy access infrastructure, which was exacerbated in 2020 by the global COVID-19 pandemic which drove a dramatic rise in remote work and learning as well as entertainment streaming. This increased demand has been challenging for the industry, even for the newest and most advanced providers. Increased subscriber usage of smartphone, video streaming services, PC gaming services and high definition and ultra-high-definition televisions has increased the network throughput demand driven by music, pictures, user-generated content (as found on many video-sharing sites) and high-definition video, which have all become a growing part of subscribers’ regular exchange of information.
 Trends such as software-as-a-service (SaaS), Cloud-based services, Internet of Things (IoT), and 5G have also increased the demand for broadband network access and customer premises solutions. All of these new technologies share a common dependency on high-bandwidth communication networks and sophisticated traffic management tools. As bandwidth demands continue to increase, carriers need to continue to upgrade their network infrastructure to support such demand. The infrastructure upgrade cycle typically has the effect of moving bandwidth bottlenecks from one part of the network to another (such as a carrier’s access network, core network or data centers), depending on the selection of technology and costs.
 It is widely acknowledged in the industry that a fiber-optic broadband access network is the preferred network architecture for a broadband fixed network. This network architecture is commonly called Fiber to the Premises (“FTTP”) for business subscribers or Fiber to the Home (“FTTH”) for residential subscribers. With FTTH, all services are generally delivered at the premise through smart optical networking terminal units (“ONT”). The Fiber to the Node (“FTTN”) architecture is also deployed where the fiber-optic cable terminates at a street cabinet which contains a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (“DSLAM”) or Multiple Service Access Node (“MSAN”) that then provides higher speed services to their customers over the last mile legacy copper wireline infrastructure. With the shift away from the legacy copper telephone Time-division Multiplexing (“TDM”) switches (used in carrier networks from the 1980’s to the early 2000’s), many carriers that continue to provide services over copper wireline networks are decommissioning their legacy telephone switches and moving services over to Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) platforms via an MSAN/Softswitch solution. Our broadband access products and solutions are designed to address all these fiber configurations, commonly referred to as FTTx, by allowing carriers and service providers to either use fiber-optic networks or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises. The demand for FTTx is also driven by various government sponsored broadband stimulus funding programs. These initiatives cultivate broadband opportunities around the world. Several of the most prominent initiatives are in North America, including American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act most recently signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. Global government sponsored broadband stimulus initiatives are less commonly known, though equally important in their contributions to the investment in fiber-optic broadband access network. We are benefitting from several customers that have accelerated their network investment because of government broadband stimulus programs.

With respect to mobile wireless networks, the popularity of mobile smartphones and increasing demand for mobile data has forced mobile network operators to upgrade their mobile access technologies from 3rd generation wireless (“3G”) to 4th generation wireless (“4G” or “LTE”) and to 5G. These technology upgrades are typically accompanied by network infrastructure upgrades, including upgrades to the carriers’ access networks (referred to as “mobile xHaul”), core networks and data centers. Our mobile xHaul products, which have features for time sensitive networks, provide a robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile network operators that enable them to upgrade their mobile fronthaul/backhaul systems and migrate to 4G and 5G.
 Another growing industry trend is the desire of carriers and service providers to simplify network operation and reduce costs. Increasingly, we see network operators seeking to reduce the number of active components in their networks and to centralize network data and control in data centers, both of which require network redesigns and upgrades. Our FiberLAN portfolio of Passive Optical LAN (“POL”) products, as well as our Ethernet switching products and SDN and NFV tools and building blocks, are designed to address these market trends, with POL emerging as a popular customer choice for network upgrades.

We are committed to invest in leading edge technology research and development for new products and innovative solutions that align with our business strategy. Our research and product development expenses were $47.0 million and $38.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 We seek to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a number of patents and trademarks in the United States of America (“United States”) and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in every jurisdiction or any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process, both domestically and internationally, make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
 Many of our products include intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The communications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 Sales and Marketing
 
We have a global sales presence with customers from over 100 countries, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through channel partners with support from our sales force. Channel partners include distributors, value added resellers, system integrators and service providers. These partners sell directly to and service end customers and often provide additional value-added services such as system installation, technical support, and professional support services in addition to equipment sales. Our sales efforts are generally organized and sized according to geographical regions for target carriers, service providers, municipalities and enterprise customers.

Our marketing team works closely with our sales, research and product development organizations, and our customers by providing communications that keep the market current on our products and features. Marketing also identifies and sizes new target markets for our products, creates awareness of our company and products, generates contacts and leads within these targeted markets, performs outbound education and public relations, and participates in industry associations and standard industry bodies to promote the growth of the overall industry.
 Our backlog consists of purchase orders for products and services that we expect to ship or perform within the next year. Our backlog may fluctuate based on the timing of when purchase orders are received. As of December 31, 2021, our backlog was approximately $225.0 million, compared to $71.0 million at December 31, 2020. We consider backlog to be an indicator, but not the sole predictor, of future sales because our customers may cancel or defer orders without penalty.
 Competition
 We compete in communications equipment markets, providing products and services for the delivery of broadband connectivity, connected home and business, mobile and optical edge transport, and cloud software-based services. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer advantages in both operational efficiency and service performance. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in our core broadband connectivity and connected home and business markets, including ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia, Ubiquoss, and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, which is a subset of our broadband connectivity and connected home and business market, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia, and Tellabs, among others. In our mobile and optical edge transport business, our competitors include Ciena, Cisco and Juniper Networks, among others. In our cloud software business, our competitors include solutions from ADTRAN, Calix, Ciena, Nokia, and Solarwinds. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our sales globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do.
 The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:
  
• | product performance;
--+---------------------


• | feature capabilities;
--+----------------------


• | manufacturing capacity;
--+------------------------


• | interoperability with existing products;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | scalability and upgradeability;
--+--------------------------------

--+-------------------

 While we believe that we compete successfully with respect to each of these factors, we currently face and expect we will continue to face intense competition in our markets. In addition, the inherent nature of communications networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 
Operationally, we use a global sourcing procurement program to purchase and manage key raw materials and subassemblies through qualified suppliers, sub-contractors, original equipment and design manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service vendors. The manufacturing process uses a strategic combination of procurement from qualified suppliers and in-house manufacturing. Throughout the process we manage the assembly, quality assurance, customer testing, final inspection and shipping of our products.
 6
 

We manufacture our low volume, high mix products at our manufacturing facility in Seminole, Florida, USA. For certain products, we rely on contract manufacturers, primarily located in Vietnam and China, and original design manufacturers for high volume, low mix products. We have generally been able to have sufficient production capacity to meet demand for our product offerings through a combination of existing and added capacity, additional employees and the outsourcing of products or components.
 Some completed products are procured to our specifications and shipped directly to our customers. We also acquire completed products from certain suppliers, which we configure and ship from our facility. Some of these purchases are significant. We purchase both standard off-the-shelf parts and components, which are generally available from more than one supplier, and single-source parts and components. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies to meet customer demand in a timely manner from our current vendors, or, when necessary, from alternate vendors. We believe that alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill our needs, or design changes can be made to employ alternate parts. 
 The recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China and other countries has negatively impacted our supply chain in recent months. Supply chain pricing, freight and logistics costs, availability, and extended lead-times became a challenge in 2021 as the world economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to incur elevated costs for components and expedite fees, our supply chain and operations teams continue to focus on managing through a constrained environment, thereby enabling DZS to maximize shipments despite elongated lead times. We remain cautious about continued supply chain headwinds that challenge the industry and anticipate a constrained supply chain environment to persist throughout 2022.
 We design, specify, and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet our quality standards. Our manufacturing and test engineers work closely with our design engineers to ensure manufacturability and testability of our products, and to ensure that manufacturing and testing processes evolve along with our technologies. Our manufacturing engineers specify, build, or procure our test stations, establish quality standards and protocols, and develop comprehensive test procedures and processes to assure the reliability and quality of our products. Products that are procured complete or partially complete are inspected, tested, or audited for quality control.
 Our Quality Management System is compliant with, and we are certified to, ISO-9001:2015 by our external registrar, National Standards Authority of Ireland. ISO-9001:2015 requires that our processes be documented, followed and continuously improved. Internal audits are conducted on a regular schedule by our quality assurance personnel, and external audits are conducted by our external registrar each year. Our quality system is based upon our model for quality assurance in production and service to ensure our products meet rigorous quality standards.
 Compliance with Regulatory and Industry Standards
 Our products must comply with a significant number of voice and data regulations and standards which vary by jurisdiction. Standards for new services continue to evolve, and we may need to modify our products or develop new versions to meet these standards. Standards setting and compliance verification in the United States are determined by the Federal Communications Commission, Underwriters Laboratories (a global safety certification company), Quality Management Institute (a management training and leadership company), Telecordia (an operations management and fraud prevention solutions company which is a subsidiary of Ericsson), and other communications companies. In international markets, our products must comply with standards issued, implemented and enforced by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions, as applicable, such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (“ETSI”), among others.
Environmental Matters 
 Our operations and manufacturing processes are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations relate to the presence, use, handling, storage, discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, the pre-treatment and discharge of process waste waters and the control of process air pollutants. Under certain laws of the United States, we can be held responsible for cleanup costs at currently or formerly owned or operated locations or at third party sites to which our wastes were sent for disposal. To date, liabilities relating to contamination have not been significant, and have not had a material impact on our operations or results. We believe that our operations and manufacturing processes currently comply in all material respects with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, the suspension of production or a prohibition on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur significant expenses to comply with environmental laws or regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product or the development or installation of additional pollution control technology. From time to time new laws or regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such laws or regulations will be implemented and enforced, or the impact they will have on our operations or results. 
 7
 

Our operations in the European Union are subject to the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. We are aware of and are taking suitable action to comply with the new European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances standards. Our operations in the United States or other countries, such as Japan and China are subject to similar legislation. Our failure to comply with any regulatory requirements or contractual obligations relating to environmental matters or hazardous materials could result in us being liable for costs, fines, penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the jurisdictions where such laws or the regulations apply.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 840 personnel worldwide. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive. Competition for technical personnel in our industry is intense. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel. To date, we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees, but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future.
