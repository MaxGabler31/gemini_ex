ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Corporate Overview
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017, the terms “KonaRed”, “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Registrant”, and the “Company” mean KonaRed Corporation. Unless otherwise stated, “$” refers to United States dollars. Our fiscal year end is December 31st. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 4, 2010 and our predecessor operating business was incorporated in the State of Hawaii on August 22, 2008. Our head office and distribution center is located at 2042 Corte Del Nogal, Suite 200, Carlsbad, CA 92011
 
The Company’s common stock is publicly traded on the OTCPK over-the-counter market under the trading symbol: KRED.
 
The Company “went dark” (terminated the registration of its Common Stock class under the Securities Exchange Act and suspended its Securities Exchange Act and Securities Act reporting obligations) on October 24, 2017, as a condition to the closing of a major Preferred Stock financing transaction.  The provisions of the Securities Exchange Act which are applicable to “public companies” and their directors, officers and 10% stockholders no longer apply to the Company and its directors, officers and 10% stockholders.  The Company is not required to file any other Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K after December 31, 2017, other than this final 2017 Form 10-K report.
 
This is the Company’s Annual Report for the 2017 year.  This document does not purport to provide a full report on 2018 or 2019 matters.
 
When a company goes “dark,” public trading in its stock becomes much more difficult, and publicly trading would typically become illiquid and sporadic.  The Company’s stock is able to be publicly traded only on OTC Markets Group’s “Pink” trading level, the OTCPK market.  The Company has ceased to be legally required to provide (and would elect not to voluntarily provide) “current public information” such as would facilitate investor interest and Rule 144 trading eligibility.  (Thus, the phrase “going dark.”) 
 
The Company reminds its Common Stock shareholders that, even after the Company “went dark” and is no longer a “public company,” they remain Company shareholders, and holders of Company equity, for their same number of shares of Company Common Stock.
 
Description of Business
 
Beverage Products
 
KonaRed® Corporation is a Hawaiian Coffee Company and the pioneer of the USA Grown, Hawaiian Coffee Fruit. The company oversees a vertically integrated supply chain which starts with the world renowned, highest quality Coffee and Coffee Fruit from Kona, Hawaii. The Company produces five award winning Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) 12oz and 32oz Cold Brew Coffee varieties, Key Kegs, a complete line of whole bean and ground Kona Coffee Beans, single serve cups, plus its well established RTD Antioxidant Juices. KonaRed products are sold throughout the U.S. and can be found in select Vons, Albertsons, Publix, Pavilions, Meijer, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, King Soopers, Smiths, Safeway, Whole Foods, 7-Eleven and many other retail outlets. More information about KonaRed and its products can be found at www.konared.com.
Award Winning RTD Cold Brew Coffees
 
In February 2016 we introduced a new line of Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) Cold Brew Coffees which included the flavors of ‘Original’, ‘Hawaiian Vanilla’ and ‘Espresso’. In August 2016, consumer demand precipitated the addition of ‘Kauai Caramel’ and ‘Maui Mocha’ flavors. Sales of this product have expanded quickly and the line is now being sold in leading retailers throughout the US. Hawaiian Vanilla has won the BeverageWorld BevStar award and the Original Cold Brew won the Gourmet Retailer Editor’s Choice for Best Coffee. KonaRed RTD Cold Brew Coffees have become one of the leading brands in this fast growing consumer packaged goods sector. Cold brew coffee continues to grow in popularity as it appeals to premium beverage trends, but also health and wellness ones too. The company added a line of 32oz sizes to complement the 12oz variety in June 2017.

Use of Patents
 
An important element of our business is the License we have been provided by VDF FutureCeuticals, Inc. (“VDF”), which provides us with the use of VDF’s coffee fruit patents and Coffeeberry® trademark license. A License Agreement has effectively formed a strategic alliance between KonaRed and VDF.
 
We developed the necessary processing and manufacturing intellectual property (“IP”) for processing and manufacturing our base ingredient - the coffee fruit (and have subsequently coordinated this with the IP provided by VDF). The License Agreement provides us with access to use of VDF’s patents, as existing and/or modified in the future, along with the processes, products, methods, compositions and know-how developed by VDF related to the patented Coffee Cherry related inventions, trade secrets and know-how.
 
Trademarks
 
We use several trademarks in branding our business:
 
KonaRed
 Hand Crafted with Aloha
 Paradise in a Bottle
 Paradise in a Can
 Nature’s Best Kept Secret
 Best Coffee on Earth
 CoffeeBerry
 
The first three of these are our registered trademarks. In addition, we have rights to the registered CoffeeBerry® trademark.
 
Operations, Facilities and Distribution Method for Our Products
 
Our distribution facility is an 8,500 square foot facility located in Carlsbad, California. We use an outsourcing business model based on utilizing third parties for the bulk of our non-core business operations, such as manufacturing and coffee fruit extraction and retail products, while maintaining in-house control of critical marketing, product development and warehousing/shipping functions. We are transitioning to in-house bottling.
Supply and Distribution for Our Product
 
We have an agreement in place which provides a reliable and trusted source of green coffee bean and coffee fruit supply with two separate farms in Kona, Hawaii.
 
As to coffee fruit, we have an exclusive arrangement for the supply of raw coffee fruit from Greenwell Farms, Inc., a Hawaii corporation with a long established history as a major Hawaiian coffee supplier.
 
Since the fruit surrounding the coffee bean was previously discarded as a byproduct of coffee production, such raw material has also remained readily available from coffee farms located in Hawaii and internationally. Therefore, although we currently have a principal supplier, in the event that we lose this supplier, we are confident that we would be able to secure raw material from other suppliers, both in Hawaii and other locations.
 
Our production process is based on our company taking possession of the dried coffee fruit from the grower, shipping the dried coffee fruit to our Carlsbad warehouse for storage, and then subsequently sending required quantities to subcontractors for value-added processing. The value-added processing consists of water based extraction whereby the dried coffee fruit is reduced to liquid extract.
 
For our company’s beverage production, our antioxidant beverages are processed by us sending processed coffee fruit to a 3rd party flavor house which makes the KonaRed concentrate and then ships it to our company’s bottling vendors. Notably, we own the proprietary beverage formulas. Pallets of the ready-to-drink product items are then shipped back to our company’s warehouse, or third party inventory transit service providers, and disseminated to either distributors, or shipped directly to retailers.
 
The process for Cold Brew Coffee is similar.

Market
 
We believe our company has established a frontrunner position in the coffee fruit and cold brew coffee categories, boasting numerous retail entrees and continued expansion. We first established our products in the upstart coffee fruit sector on our home turf in Hawaii and then have expanded across the USA by winning placements at Kroger, Target, Vitamin Shoppe and other major retailers. We have since moved into the large and lucrative market of coffee and have expanded beyond just coffee fruit. Over 50% of Americans over the age of 18 drink coffee daily and it is a huge marketplace. We have positioned ourselves as one of the leading RTD Cold Brew Coffee product lines on the market since our February 2016 launch. We continued to expand on these markets throughout 2017.
Sales Strategy
 
Our sales strategy for our Cold Brew Coffee and Antioxidant beverages is to sell and ship directly from our warehouse in Carlsbad, California. We have a direct sales team of three individuals, two in Hawaii and one in Southern California whose main job is to secure new customers directly in person. We have also retained manufacturers’ sales representatives who work to increase our overall sales efforts in specific regions such as New York, Los Angeles and Florida. In early 2017 we signed a brokerage agreement with Impact Sale Group to represent our entire line of products to the conventional and natural sales channels in the Western United States.
 
We’ve learned the importance of supporting our distributor network through “on the ground” sales personnel and will add to our sales force as markets develop. For an emerging product such as ours, merchandising follow-up, dialog with store managers, and coordination of promotions and pricing are critical in maintaining brand momentum. We anticipate adding sales staff to meet demand as we grow.
 
Although KonaRed was invented as a wellness product, we believe consumer acceptance of our beverage products now places us both within the coffee and ‘premium juice’ retail categories, as well as on dairy shelves with cold brew coffees, and the coffee aisle with our whole bean coffee line.
 
In summary, our sales expansion priorities are:
 
(1) expansion of wholesale distribution
 (2) retail chain success
 (3) growth of direct to retail sales
 (4) growth of direct to consumer sales, and
 (5) development of raw material ingredient sales
 
Major Industry Participants
 
The expansion of leading beverage monoliths within new products in the beverage category has tightened pricing but also created a vibrant mergers and acquisitions environment for emerging brands like KonaRed.
 
Takeovers and mergers are a hallmark of our industry. Recent beverage industry deals have included:
 

• | Coca Cola acquired Zico Coconut Water in January 2014 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Nestle acquired 100% of Chameleon Cold Brew Coffee for an undisclosed amount in 2017 
• | InBev has made a series of investments in Sambazon (in August 2012, December 2011, and December 2008) 
• | InBev has also made a series of investments in Vita Coco in May 2012 and December 2010 
• | Bai Brands sold to Dr. Pepper Snapple for an acquisition price of $1.7 billion in December 2016 
• | Peets Coffee & Tea purchased 100% of Stumptown Coffee Roasters in October 2015 for an undisclosed amount
• | High Brew Coffee received a $4 Million investment from CAVU Venture Partners in April 2016

Market Development and Metrics
 
Our objective is to develop KonaRed into a powerhouse coffee company which supplies consumers with a variety of high quality coffee, beverage and nutritional products. We plan to achieve this using a strategy of expanding our retail footprint through a series of revenue generating distribution channels as well as direct to consumer sales.
 
Presently, our predominant focus is our beverage and cold brew coffee businesses and we are generating revenues through the following distribution channels:
 

• | Direct Store Distributors
--+--------------------------


• | Broadline Distributors
--+-----------------------


• | Direct to Retail
--+-----------------


• | Online Retail
--+--------------


• | Raw Material Ingredient Sales
--+------------------------------

 
The specifics of each channel are as follows:
 

• | Direct Store Distributors: The direct store distributors (“DSDs”) channel comprises wholesale distributors who maintain in-house inventories of multiple brands of beverage products, such as juices, beer, and water, which they sell to retail stores and other wholesalers. DSD is a business process that manufacturers use to both sell and distribute goods directly to point of sales or point of consumption including additional product and market related services such as merchandising. In order to fulfill growing demand from retailers, DSDs specializing in the beverage channels are expanding their functional beverage categories to include the type of products in which KonaRed specializes. (A ‘functional beverage’ is defined as one which has certain attributes, such as Antioxidants.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broadline Distributors: The broadline distributors channel includes wholesalers who specialize in distribution of natural food products to retail stores. A broadline distributor services a wide variety of accounts with a wide variety of products ranging from food, beverages and supplies in the natural channel selling to retailers like Whole Foods Markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Direct to Retail: During our growth phase we have developed a direct to retail sales channel to grocery stores such as Albertson’s and specialty retail stores. We intend to continue to service and develop this channel further. Direct to retailer includes major retail chains with 500 locations or more where the KonaRed product ships direct to the retailer’s distribution centers and the retailers are responsible for the distribution to each retail store. 
• | Online Retail: The KonaRed brand has gained an increasing following of Internet based customers who purchase our products directly through our website. We plan to expand this channel though on-line marketing initiatives in parallel with our brand recognition marketing campaigns. In April, 2016 we re-launched our website after a major overhaul which included addition of the Shopify platform to promote efficient online sales. 
• | Raw Material Ingredient Sales: In December 2015, we launched our coffee fruit raw ingredient materials division and will be working to expand this revenue channel in cooperation with VDF.

To develop this strategy we continually evaluate: product line sales, product line specific gross margin, individual products costs and pricing of individual product lines. Growth of our retail footprint will continue to be evaluated through the growth of our client base in each specific distribution channel. We will also be launching new products when the timing makes sense for the company and the market dynamics.
 
Competition
 
The beverage industry is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our product is competing directly with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other marketing campaigns. In addition, companies manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do. We compete to secure distributors who will agree to market our product over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments, including numerous specialty beverages.
 
Important factors that affect our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique and cutting edge products, attractive and unique packaging, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network. We believe our branding is strong and our position as a U.S. coffee supplier is relatively unique. We are committed to ethical production of our source ingredients and our use of a previously discarded by-product of coffee represents our environmentally positive corporate operating philosophy. We are also non-GMO. We believe these factors combine to provide us with a competitive advantage and our products are consistently well received by consumers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
KonaRed® is a registered trademark in the United States, Japan and China and we intend to seek a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We also hold trademark rights to the Paradise in a Bottle®”, “Nature’s Best Kept Secret™”, “Hand Crafted with Aloha®”, “Paradise in a Can™”, and “Best Coffee on Earth™” tag lines; and rights to a suite of international CoffeeBerry® trademarks provided under our License with VDF. We believe we have the rights to use the necessary processing and manufacturing intellectual property relating to processing and manufacturing our base ingredient (the coffee fruit) and our proprietary beverage formulas. However, we do not own the manufacturing process for making the finished beverages. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patent rights and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.
 
While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our Company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our operating strategy.
 
Partnership Initiative with VDF FutureCeuticals Inc.
 
In 2014 KonaRed settled a patent dispute with VDF by forming a partnership with them.
 
VDF is a leader in the bio-research, development, and manufacture of high-quality fruit, vegetable, and grain-based nutraceutical and functional food ingredients. VDF is committed to discovery-based research that leads to the expansion of human health, and is the trusted partner-of-choice for companies in search of creative, ethical solutions for the health and wellness needs of today’s consumer. Its sister company, Van Drunen Farms, was founded over one hundred years ago and has grown into one of the largest dried food ingredient manufacturers and suppliers in the world.

VDF is a major biotech and ingredient supplier and owner of the patent-protected CoffeeBerry® coffee fruit technology, a proprietary set of agricultural and industrial processes and a line of unique ingredients. VDF’s patents and processes capture the same potent nutrition inherent in coffee fruit which had formed the basis of two provisional patent applications made by KonaRed based on KonaRed’s own proprietary research and development.
 
The partnership brings together the flavor profile of KonaRed’s beverages and the ingenuity, innovation, and ongoing chemistry and clinical research of VDF’s globally integrated CoffeeBerry® coffee fruit ingredient platform.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.
Government Regulation
 
Our products are considered to be synonymous with coffee for regulatory purposes and are thus sold under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) “Generally Regarded as Safe” (“GRAS”) regulatory umbrella. Accordingly, we are not required to petition for FDA approval of our coffee fruit offerings, which would be typical under standard dietary supplement guidelines. However, our Company has registered all of its supply chain subcontractors with the FDA as required and has met and answered all inquiries by the FDA. We believe we are in full compliance with all FDA regulations.
 
The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our product are subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. It will be our policy to comply with any and all legal requirements.
 
Employees
 
In addition to Kyle Redfield, who is our Chief Executive Officer and Director, we currently employ 10 full-time employees who all work in the United States. Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research; and as needed we engage the services of other professionals for legal, audit and other technical services. We intend to expand our current management to retain other skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management’s relationships will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks.
