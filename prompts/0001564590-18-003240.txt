ITEM 1.  BUSINESS 
Overview
 All references to "LSB Industries,” “LSB,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to LSB Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to LSB Industries, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.  Notes referenced throughout this document refer to consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures that are found in Item 8.
 The Company was formed in 1968 as an Oklahoma corporation and became a Delaware corporation in 1977. We manufacture and market chemical products for the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  We own and operate facilities in El Dorado, Arkansas (the “El Dorado Facility”), Cherokee, Alabama (the “Cherokee Facility”), and Pryor, Oklahoma (the “Pryor Facility”), and we operate a facility for Covestro AG (“Covestro”) in Baytown, Texas (the “Baytown Facility”).  Our products are sold through distributors and directly to end customers throughout the United States.
 Our Business
 Our business manufactures products for three principal markets:
  
• | ammonia, fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate (“AN” and “HDAN”) and urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”) for agricultural applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high purity and commercial grade ammonia, high purity AN, sulfuric acids, concentrated, blended and regular nitric acid, mixed nitrating acids, carbon dioxide, and diesel exhaust fluid (“DEF”) for industrial applications; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | industrial grade AN (“LDAN”) and AN solutions for the mining industry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The products we manufacture are primarily derived from two raw material feedstocks: natural gas and ammonia.  Our facilities and production processes have been designed to produce products that are marketable at nearly each stage of production.  This has allowed us to develop and deploy a business model that optimizes the mix of products to capture the value opportunities in the end markets we serve with a focus on balancing our production. 
 The chart below highlights representative products and applications in each of our end markets.
  
End Market | Products | Applications 
Agricultural | UAN, HDAN, ammonia | Fertilizer and fertilizer blends for corn and other crops; NPK fertilizer blends


Industrial Acids and Other | Nitric acid, ammonia, sulfuric acid, diesel exhaust fluid | Semi-conductor and polyurethane intermediates; Pulp and paper, alum, water treatment, metals and vanadium processing; Power plant emissions abatement, water treatment, refrigerants, metals processing; Exhaust stream additive
Mining | LDAN, AN solutions, and Specialty HDAN | Specialty emulsions for mining applications, surface mining, quarries, and construction

Prior to July 1, 2016, we manufactured and sold a range of heating, ventilation and air conditioning products and related services (the “Climate Control Business”).  These products were primarily used in commercial, institutional and residential new building construction and renovations.  On July 1, 2016, we sold the Climate Control Business.
 For information regarding our net sales, operating income or losses and total assets for the past three fiscal years, see the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
 Our Strategy
 We pursue a strategy of balancing the sale of product as fertilizer into the agriculture markets at spot prices or short duration pre-sales and developing industrial and mining customers that purchase substantial quantities of products, primarily under contractual obligations and/or pricing arrangements that provide for the pass through of raw material and other manufacturing costs.  We believe that this product and market diversification strategy allows us to have more consistent levels of production then some of our competitors and helps reduce the volatility risk inherent in the prices of our raw material feedstocks and/or the changes in demand for our products. 
 The strategy of developing industrial and mining customers is to moderate the risk inherent in the agricultural markets where spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not have a correlation to the natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for like and competing nitrogen sources.  This volatility of sales pricing in our agricultural products may, from time to time, compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the product.  Additionally, the lack of sufficient non-seasonal agricultural sales volume to operate our manufacturing facilities at optimum levels can preclude us from balancing production and storage capabilities. Looking forward, we continually pursue profitable growth and margin enhancement.  Our strategy calls for continued emphasis on the agricultural sector, while remaining committed to further developing industrial customers who assume the volatility risk associated with the raw material costs and mitigate the effects of seasonality in the agricultural sector.
 Our strategy also includes evaluating investment in expansion projects, along with reliability and efficiency improvement projects.
 Key Initiatives for 2018
 We believe our future results of operations and financial condition will depend significantly on our ability to successfully implement the following key initiatives:
  
• | Improving the on-stream rates of our chemical plants. We have several initiatives underway that we believe will assist us in improving the reliability of our plants and allow us to produce more products for sale while lowering our cost of production. In 2017, we made the decision to upgrade our existing maintenance management system through technology enhancements and work processes to improve our predictive and preventative maintenance programs at our facilities. At that time, we also made the decision to engage outside maintenance experts to assist us in expediting its implementation and in its overall use. We expect that the system will be implemented by the end of the second quarter of 2018 and we will begin to see the benefits in the second half of 2018. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, specific to our Pryor Facility, we engaged several outside engineering firms to assist us in an overall plant reliability study which will be used to enhance our reliability improvement plan for that facility.  We expect the study to be completed during the second quarter of 2018.
  
• | Focus on the Continued Improvement of Our Safety Performance. We believe that high safety standards are critical to improved plant performance. With that in mind, we implemented enhanced safety programs at our facilities that focus on reducing risks and improving our safety culture in 2017. The implementation and training of these programs will continue in 2018 and we expect these will benefit our on-stream rates. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continue Broadening of the distribution of our AN and Nitric Acid products. We increased our overall sales volume of HDAN in 2017 by approximately 60,000 tons or 26% to approximately 290,000 tons compared to 230,000 tons for 2016 through various marketing initiatives which include: (1) storing and distributing HDAN at our Pryor and Cherokee Facilities which allows us to sell to new markets and customers out of those facilities and; (2) educating growers on the additional applications for HDAN. In 2018, we will continue to focus on those initiatives and other initiatives in an effort to continue to grow our annual sales volumes over 2017. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, through increased marketing efforts, we increased our sales volumes of Nitric Acid by approximately 18,000 tons from 82,000 tons in 2016 to 100,000 tons in 2017.  We will continue to focus on increasing our marketing efforts in order to expand our market for our nitric acid products in North America.
  
• | Improving the Margins on Sales of Our Products. Over the last several years, we have focused on increasing our sales volumes to produce at optimal on-stream rates and lower our manufacturing costs per ton of product. Beginning in 2018, we will undertake a review of all sales to customers to determine if there are opportunities to improve the margins on sales to those customers and to explore if there are further product upgrading opportunities. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reducing and controlling our cost structure. We have engaged outside experts to assist us in centralizing and expanding our Company-wide procurement efforts. We expect this to be implemented by the end of the second quarter of 2018 and believe that these efforts will result in a reduction in expenses and capital spend in the aggregate of between $3 million to $5 million on an annualized basis. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our SG&A and plant expenses over $12 million annually and believe, in addition to the procurement initiative discussed above, there is still an opportunity to further reduce those expenses.  
  
• | Focus on Improving Our Capital Structure and Overall Cost of Capital. We are actively seeking ways to improve our capital structure and reduce our overall cost of capital. We believe that the improving end markets for our products combined with our improved operating performance will be a benefit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may not successfully implement any or all these initiatives.  Even if we successfully implement the initiatives, they may not achieve the results that we expect or desire.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Strategically Located Chemical Assets and Long-Standing Customer Relationships
 Our business benefits from highly advantaged locations with logistical and distribution benefits.  We have access to the ammonia pipeline from the U.S. Gulf at our El Dorado Facility, which provides low cost transportation to distribution points.  The El Dorado Facility also has rail access that is in close proximity to our HDAN customers.  Our Cherokee Facility is located east of the Mississippi River, allowing it to reach customers that are not freight logical for others.  Our Cherokee Facility sits adjacent to the Tennessee River, providing barge access, in addition to truck and rail access.  Our Pryor Facility is located in the heart of the Southern Plains with close proximity to the Port of Catoosa along with strategic rail and truck access. 
Advantaged and Improving Raw Material Cost Position
 We believe we are able to effectively manage input costs for our primary raw materials, natural gas and ammonia, which allows us to partially offset the impact of volatility in feedstock costs in our business.  We currently produce ammonia at our El Dorado Facility, our Cherokee Facility and our Pryor Facility, which allows us to take advantage of the spread between producing and purchasing ammonia at those facilities.  Additionally, our Pryor Facility has a natural gas cost advantage as its cost of gas is materially lower than our El Dorado and Cherokee Facilities.  The Baytown Facility does not produce ammonia and therefore purchases between 135,000 to 145,000 tons of ammonia per year.  However, under our long-term contract with Covestro, we pass through the full cost of the ammonia, leaving us with no exposure to ammonia price fluctuations.
Diversified Sources of Revenue
 Our business serves a broad range of end markets, which we believe diminishes the cyclicality of our financial performance.  Our business serves the agricultural, industrial and mining markets.  The flexible nature of our production process allows us the ability to shift our product mix based on end market demand. 
Operation of Multiple Facilities and High Production Capacity 
 We operate our business through several facilities.  Operating multiple facilities diversifies the risk and impact of operational issues that may occur at a single plant, which gives us a strategic advantage over competitors that operate their company through a single facility.  Additionally, our competitive production capacity of our combined plants allows us to decrease manufacturing costs, helping us to achieve enhanced margins.

Market Conditions
 As discussed in more detail under “Key Industry Factors” of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) contained in Item 7 of this report, agricultural fertilizer demand is a significant driver of our sales volumes.  This demand is influenced by the number of acres planted of crops, principally corn, that require fertilizer to grow and to enhance yield.  Corn prices affect the number of acres of corn planted in a given year, and the number of acres planted will influence nitrogen fertilizer consumption, likely affecting ammonia, UAN and urea prices.  Weather also has an effect on fertilizer application and consumption.  
 The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report (“WASDE”) released February 8, 2018 reports U.S. corn production for 2016/2017 (“2017 Crop”) was 15.2 billion bushels, up 11.4% from 2015/2016 (“2016 Crop”), reflecting increases in planted and harvested acres.  In addition, they estimate yields per acre of 174.6 bushels per acre for the 2017 Crop compared to 168.4 bushels per acre for the 2016 Crop.  This report also estimates world corn ending stocks for 2017/2018 (“2018 Crop”) at 203.1 million tons, a decrease over the 2017 Crop ending stocks of approximately 11.6% while U.S. corn ending stocks of 59.8 million tons, an increase of approximately 3% over the prior year.  This has led the WASDE to estimate that U.S. growers will plant 90.2 million acres of corn in the 2018 Crop, a decrease of 3.8 million acres over the previous year, with expected yields of 176.6 bushels per acre, a 1% increase in yield from the previous year.
In our industrial markets, our sales volumes are typically driven by changes in general economic conditions, energy prices, and our contractual arrangements with certain large customers.  Our mining products are generally sold into the coal, metals and mineral mining and aggregates markets with the majority of those sales being sold into the coal markets.  As such, U.S. annual coal production will drive sale volumes of our mining products and over the past several years, U.S. coal production has been negatively impacted by low natural gas prices among other things.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported, that annual coal production in the U.S. for the full year 2017 was up 6% from 2016 due to increased export demand.  EIA is forecasting a 2% decrease in U.S. coal production in 2018 and another 2% decrease in 2019.  U.S. coal consumption is also expected to decline over the next two years due to low natural gas prices reducing demand for coal for coal-fired electricity generation.  EIA also expects U.S. coal export demand to decline in 2018 and 2019.  We believe that coal production in the U.S. continues to face significant challenges from competition from natural gas and renewable sources of energy.  While we believe our plants are well-located to support the more stable coal-producing regions in the upcoming years, our current mining sales volumes are being affected by overall lower customer demand for LDAN.  We do not expect a significant increase in our mining business in the near term.  In addition, the metals and mineral mining markets have been and, in certain segments such as iron ore, continue to be negatively impacted by commodity price decreases which have curtailed their activity and negatively impacted our sales into that market.
 Natural gas is the basic feedstock for the production of ammonia and therefore natural gas prices have a significant impact on the production cost of our ammonia.  Given the current relatively low price of natural gas in North America and the expectation that pricing of natural gas will remain relatively low for the foreseeable future, North American ammonia producers are currently low-cost producers of ammonia that is consumed in North America and the expectation is that will continue. 
 That low cost of production stimulated investment in brownfield and greenfield nitrogen expansion projects in the U.S.  Many of those projects were cancelled or placed on hold.  However, a number of the announced expansion projects have been completed and began production during 2017. These expansion projects are expected to increase ammonia production in the U.S. by approximately 5 million tons annually in addition to expansion of other upgraded nitrogen products.  This additional domestic ammonia and other upgraded product production is expected to replace product that is currently being imported into North America.  However, the amount and timing of new nitrogen production could have a negative effect on selling prices of nitrogen-based products in 2018 caused by an imbalance of supply and demand.
 Agricultural Products 
 We produce and sell UAN, HDAN and ammonia, all of which are nitrogen-based fertilizers.  We sell these agricultural products to farmers, ranchers, fertilizer dealers and distributors primarily in the ranch land and grain production markets in the U.S.  Our nitrogen-based fertilizers are used to grow food crops, biofuel feedstock crops, pasture land for grazing livestock and forage production.  We maintain long-term relationships with wholesale agricultural distributors and retailers and also sell directly to agricultural end-users through our network of wholesale and retail distribution centers. 
 The price at which our agricultural products are ultimately sold depends on numerous factors, including the supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers which, in turn, depends upon world grain demand and production levels, the cost and availability of transportation and storage, weather conditions, competitive pricing and the availability of imports.  Additionally, expansions or upgrades of competitors’ facilities and internationals and domestic political and economic developments continue to play an important role in the global nitrogen fertilizer industry economics.  These factors can affect, in addition to selling prices, the level of inventories in the market which can cause price volatility and affect product margins. 
 We develop our market position in these areas by emphasizing high quality products, customer service and technical advice.  During the past few years, we have been successful in expanding outside our traditional markets by delivering to distributors on the Tennessee 
 6


and Ohio rivers by barge, and by delivering to certain Western States by rail.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our AN products under “Key Initiatives for 2018”.
 In addition, we have an agreement with a third-party purchaser (Coffeyville Resources Nitrogen Fertilizers, LLC, “CVR”) to market and sell a portion of our UAN.  Demand for sales under this agreement is based on the expected needs of the purchaser’s customers.  The agreement provides the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to purchase, at market prices, substantially all of the UAN produced at our Pryor Facility.  The term of the agreement runs through June 2019 with annual renewal options.  
 We sell most of our agricultural products at the current spot market price in effect at the time of shipment, although during certain times of the year, we enter into forward sales commitments for some of these products.  Sales of our industrial and mining products are generally made to customers pursuant to sales contracts or pricing arrangements on terms that include the cost of raw material feedstock as a pass-through component in the sales price.  These contractual sales stabilize the effect of commodity cost changes and fluctuations in demand for these products due to the cyclicality of the end markets.
 Industrial Acids and Other Chemical Products
 We manufacture and sell industrial acids and other chemical products primarily to the polyurethane, paper, fibers, emission control, and electronics industries.  In addition, we produce and sell blended and regular nitric acid and industrial and high purity ammonia for many specialty applications, including the reduction of air emissions from power plants. In addition, one of our subsidiaries, El Dorado Chemical Company (“EDC”) and Koch Fertilizer are parties to an ammonia purchase and sale agreement under which Koch Fertilizer agreed to purchase, with minimum purchase requirements, the ammonia that is in excess of EDC’s internal needs.  We began selling ammonia under this agreement during June 2016.  The term of the agreement runs until June 2019, with annual renewal options.
We operate the Baytown Facility on behalf of Covestro and we believe it is one of the largest and most technologically advanced nitric acid manufacturing units in the U.S.  The majority of the Baytown Facility’s production is sold to Covestro pursuant to a long-term contract (the “Covestro Agreement”).  This agreement: (a) allows us to pass-through almost all of the costs of producing the nitric acid that Covestro purchases, including the cost of ammonia; (b) to receive management fees for managing the operations and for marketing nitric acid not used by Covestro to third party customers and; (c) to receive a portion of any carbon credits that are sold.  The term of this agreement runs until June 2021 with options for renewal.
 Our industrial products sales volumes are dependent upon general economic conditions primarily in the housing, automotive, and paper industries.  Our sale prices generally vary with the market price of our feedstock (ammonia or natural gas, as applicable) in our pricing arrangements with customers. 
 Our industrial business competes based upon service, price and location of production and distribution sites, product quality and performance and provides inventory management as part of the value-added services offered to certain customers.  See our discussion above concerning broadening the distribution of our Nitric Acid products under “Key Initiatives for 2018”.
 Mining Products 
 We produce and sell LDAN and AN solution to the mining industry, which are primarily used as AN fuel oil and specialty emulsions for surface mining of coal, mining of precious metals and for usage in quarries and providing aggregates to the construction industry.  We have signed long-term contracts with customers that provide for the annual sale of LDAN under various natural-gas-cost-plus-a-fixed-dollar-amount pricing arrangements. 
Dependence on Limited Number of Customers 
 As discussed in various risk factors under Item 1A, historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers. Information relating to our significant customers for each of the last three years appears in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Raw Materials
 The products we manufacture are primarily derived from natural gas and ammonia.  These raw material feedstocks are commodities and subject to price fluctuations. 
 Natural gas is the primary raw material for producing ammonia, UAN and other products at our El Dorado, Cherokee and Pryor Facilities.  When operating at optimum on-stream rates, the El Dorado Facility would purchase approximately 15.6 million MMBtus of natural gas annually to produce approximately 450,000 tons of ammonia; the Cherokee Facility would purchase approximately 5.8 million MMBtus of natural gas per year in order to produce approximately 180,000 tons of ammonia; and the Pryor Facility would purchase approximately 6.8 million MMBtus of natural gas annually to produce approximately 235,000 tons of ammonia.
 7


The chemical facilities’ natural gas feedstock requirements are generally purchased at spot market price.  Periodically, we enter into volume purchase commitments and/or futures/forward contracts to lock in the cost of certain of the expected natural gas requirements primarily to match quantities needed to produce product that has been sold forward.  As of December 31, 2017, we had volume purchase commitments with a fixed cost for natural gas of approximately 1.3 million MMBtus at an average cost of $2.42 per MMBtu.  These commitments are for firm purchases during the first quarter of 2018 and represent approximately 17% of our total exposed natural gas usage required for that period.
 The Baytown Facility purchases 135,000 to 145,000 tons of ammonia per year.  However, under our long-term contracts for that business, we pass through the full cost of the ammonia leaving us with no exposure to ammonia price fluctuations. 
 See further discussion relating to the outlook for our business under “Key Industry Factors” in our MD&A contained in this report.
 Seasonality
 We believe fertilizer products sold to the agricultural industry are seasonal while sales into the industrial and mining sectors generally are less susceptible.  The selling seasons for agricultural products are primarily during the spring and fall planting seasons, which typically extend from March through June and from September through November in the geographical markets we distribute the majority of our agricultural products.  As a result, we typically increase our inventory of fertilizer products prior to the beginning of each planting season in order to meet the demand for our products.  In addition, the amount and timing of sales to the agricultural markets depend upon weather conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. 
Regulatory Matters
 We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations as discussed under “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters" of this Item 1 and various risk factors under Item 1A.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market with many other larger chemical companies, such as Austin Powder Company, CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Chemtrade Logistics Inc., Cytec Industries, OCI Partners LP, Dyno Nobel, a subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited, The Gavilon Group, Helm AG, Koch Industries, Norfalco, Nutrien (formerly known as Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan), Orica Limited, Praxair, Inc., Quad Chemical Corporation, Trammo Inc. and Yara International (some of whom are our customers), many of whom have greater financial and other resources than we do.  We believe that competition within the markets we serve is primarily based upon service, price, location of production and distribution sites, and product quality and performance.
Additional Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 
 For each of the last three years, all of our net sales and long-lived assets relate to domestic operations.  In addition, net sales to non-U.S. customers were minimal.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 569 persons, 166 of whom are represented by unions under agreements that expire in July of 2018 through November of 2019. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and to other laws regarding health and safety matters (the “Environmental and Health Laws”), many of which provide for certain performance obligations, substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations.  Certain Environmental and Health Laws impose strict liability as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.  In connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses.  In certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to receive environmental permits that we need to operate.  In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety effects of our operations.
 There can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in complying with such laws or in paying fines or penalties for violation of such laws.  Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us.  The Environmental and Health Laws and enforcement policies thereunder 
 8


have in the past resulted, and could in the future result, in significant compliance expenses, cleanup costs (for our sites or third-party sites where our wastes were disposed of), penalties or other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials at or from our facilities or the use or disposal of certain of its chemical products.  Historically, our subsidiaries have incurred significant expenditures in order to comply with the Environmental and Health Laws and are reasonably expected to do so in the future.  We will also be obligated to manage certain discharge water outlets and monitor groundwater contaminants at our chemical facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility.
