   Business Combination Agreement
 
On August 30, 2021, the Company, Acorn Holdco, ADVA and Acorn MergeCo, Inc ("Merger Sub”) entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company and ADVA agreed to combine their respective businesses and each become subsidiaries of a new holding company, Acorn HoldCo, a Delaware corporation and currently a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company.
 
Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Merger Sub, a newly formed Delaware corporation and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Acorn HoldCo, will merge with and into ADTRAN, with ADTRAN surviving the merger (the “Merger”) as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Acorn HoldCo. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of Acorn HoldCo. Acorn HoldCo has also made a public exchange offer to exchange each issued and outstanding no-par value bearer share of ADVA, pursuant to which each ADVA share tendered and accepted for exchange will be exchanged for 0.8244 shares of common stock of Acorn HoldCo (the “Exchange Offer”, and together with the Merger, the “Business Combination”). Upon completion of the Business Combination, and assuming that all of the outstanding ADVA shares are exchanged in the Exchange Offer, former ADTRAN stockholders and former ADVA shareholders will own approximately 54% and 46%, respectively, of the outstanding Acorn HoldCo shares.
 The Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company and by the supervisory board and management board of ADVA. On January 6, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the Business Combination by an overwhelming majority. The end of the ADVA shareholder tender offer acceptance period was on January 26, 2022, which resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by more than 60% of all shares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of October 31, 2021, thus exceeding the required minimum acceptance threshold. According to the rules of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act, ADVA shareholders who did not tender their shares during the initial acceptance period could do so during a two-week additional acceptance period that began on February 1, 2022 and ended February 14, 2022. This resulted in the acceptance of the Exchange Offer by approximately 66% of all shares of ADVA entitled to voting rights existing as of November 30, 2021. On January 24, 2022, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the transaction was not a “covered transaction” subject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, satisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to CFIUS notification. On February 16, 2022, the U.K. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy completed its review of the Business Combination and determined that the Secretary of State will be taking no further action under the National Security and Investment Act 2021 ("NS&I Act"), satisfying the condition of the Business Combination Agreement related to NS&I Act approval. Cooperative proceedings continue with the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.
 The Company anticipates the consummation of the Business Combination around the middle of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, and regulatory approvals from the foreign direct investment authority in Germany.
 Additional information about the Business Combination Agreement and proposed Business Combination is set forth in the Company’s filings with the SEC, as well as in the registration statement on Form S-4 that Acorn HoldCo filed with the SEC, which was declared effective December 2, 2021 (the “Acorn HoldCo Registration Statement”).

   Industry Overview
 Communications solution providers are investing in their networks for growth in subscriber acquisition and retention, while streamlining their operations to reduce costs and complexity. Drivers for this network investment include the evolution of government funding programs, regulatory broadband policies, competition, increasing subscriber demand for broadband and merger obligations.
 Subscriber demand for higher bandwidth continues to increase due to increasing numbers of connected devices, shifting working arrangements, OTT video, the prevalence of IoT and cloud services and the increasing use of internet applications. Performance is directly related to bandwidth availability. As the demand for high-definition video streaming services, symmetric bandwidth for video conferencing and collaboration tools, low-latency cloud gaming services and smart home video surveillance applications continues to increase, so too does the need for higher bandwidth to the home and business. ADTRAN serves as a trusted partner to our customers. Working side-by-side with our customers, we enable them to maximize the performance from their network, providing a flexible path for their networks to evolve cost effectively, and to further monetize their investments.
 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to provide innovative and cost-effective solutions for our customers that enable them to address their increasing broadband demands. Our solutions focus on technology transformations that are happening in broadband network infrastructure, home and business CPE and software platforms, and services needed to help our customers address increasing complexity while scaling to meet increasing consumer demands. We aspire to be one of the top communication technology players in the world and plan to achieve this goal through innovation in network, home and business technology paired with a customer-focused organizational structure that tailors solutions to meet the needs of our target customers. ADTRAN has an approach to our portfolio in which we are focused in specific markets where we can offer competitive differentiation and scale while also having enough diversity and breadth in the portfolio to provide end-to-end connectivity solutions that offer value to our customers.
Customers
 We have a diverse global customer base that includes Tier-1, -2 and -3 service providers, alternative service providers, such as utilities, municipalities and fiber overbuilders, cable/MSOs, SMBs and distributed enterprises. Many network operators require product approval before the purchase or installation of a product. The nature of our business involves a dynamic process of submitting new and succeeding generations of products for approval prior to orders being placed.
 One distribution partner individually comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2021. Additionally, our revenue in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. comprised more than 10% of our revenue in 2021. The revenue from this distribution partner and these countries is reported in both our Network Solutions and Services & Support segments.
 For a discussion of risks associated with customers, service providers and approval processes, see “Risk Factors – The lengthy sales and approval process required by service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue,” “Risk Factors – We depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenue and net income,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Distribution, Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our distribution network. Our direct sales organization supports major accounts and has offices in domestic and international locations. Sales to most smaller and independent telephone companies are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. Our services offerings can be purchased directly from us or through one of our service providers, channel partners or distribution partners.
 Before placing an order, service providers typically require lengthy product qualification and standardization processes that can extend for several months or even years. Once approved, product orders are typically placed under single or multi-year supply agreements that are generally not subject to minimum volume commitments. Service providers generally prefer having two or more suppliers for most products. Therefore, individual orders are usually subject to competition based on some combination of total value, service, price, delivery and other terms.
 Orders for end-user products are fulfilled through a combination of direct sales and distributors. This is supported by a direct sales organization for major accounts and a channel-based sales organization to facilitate sales to our partners. MSPs, VARs and SIs may be affiliated with the company as channel partners, or they may purchase from a distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Affiliated partners participate with us at various program levels, based on sales volume and other factors, to receive benefits such as product discounts, market development funds, technical support and training.
 
   Outside of the U.S., most service provider products are sold through our direct sales organization and end-user products are sold direct or through distribution arrangements customized for each region. Some regions are supported from a field office that offers sales and support functions, and in some cases, warehousing and manufacturing support. Our field sales organizations, distributors and service provider customers receive support from regional-based marketing, sales and customer support groups.
 Our marketing organization promotes all brands associated with ADTRAN to key stakeholders, including customers, partners and prospects throughout the world. Marketing is complemented by product marketing and management teams that work with our engineering teams to develop and promote new products and services, as well as product enhancements.
 Research and Development
 Rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements and continuing developments in communications service offerings characterize the markets for our products. Our on-going ability to adapt to these changes and to develop new and enhanced products that meet or anticipate market demand is a significant factor influencing our competitive position and our ability to grow.
 Our product development activities are an important part of our strategy. We plan to maintain our emphasis on product development to enable us to respond to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. Our research and development and engineering functions are global. We maintain research and development functions at our Huntsville, Alabama headquarters, in Germany and other locations worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, research and development expenditures totaled $108.7 million, $113.3 million and $126.2 million, respectively.
 We develop our products either internally or by leveraging partners. Additionally, in some cases, we license intellectual property or acquire technologies. Internal development on advanced technology products gives us more control over design and manufacturing issues, while for traditional designs, ODM and/or licensed intellectual property provides us with the ability to leverage the economies of scale of our technology partners. This balanced approach ensures we provide best-in-class solutions for our customers.
 As we continue to create more software-based intellectual property, such as our SDN/NFV portfolio, our use of lean agile practices in research and development ensures we remain responsive and customer-focused. This enables us to deliver products faster, at higher quality and more economically to our customers and the market on a continuous basis.
 Our ability to continually reduce product costs, while focusing on delivery and quality, are important parts of our overall business strategy. Our product development efforts are often centered on entering a market with improved technology, enabling us to offer products at competitive prices and compete for market share. We continually re-engineer successive generations of existing products to improve our product performance, costs and value. In 2021 we encountered supply chain disruptions and component shortages, which resulted in us re-engineering some of our products to work around component end of life issues. See Backlog and Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our supply chain disruptions.
 Development activities focus on solutions that support both existing and emerging communications industry technologies in segments that we consider viable revenue opportunities. We are actively engaged in developing and refining technologies to support data, voice and video transport primarily over IP/Ethernet network architectures. This includes Ethernet aggregation, fiber-optic transport and access, DSL, access routing, Ethernet switching, wireless LANs, integrated access, converged services, VoIP, network management and professional services. In 2021, we completed the design of certain IoT products, added Wi-Fi 6 gateways and completed our 10G EPON strand mount OLT. We also enhanced our SaaS delivery abilities and Mosaic One software.
 Our research function supports product development efforts throughout the Company. This function guides our various product design and engineering teams in digital signal processing technologies, computer simulation and modeling, CAD/CAM toolsets, custom semiconductor design, optical transceiver design, industry standards, technological forecasting, product development methods and emerging networks standards.
 Many communication requirements, processes and technologies are governed by SDOs. These SDOs consist of representatives from various manufacturers, service providers and testing laboratories who work to establish specifications and compliance guidelines for emerging communications technologies. We are an active participant in several SDOs and have assisted with the development of worldwide standards in many technologies.
 Our SDO activities are primarily in the area of broadband access. This includes involvement with the ITU-T, ATIS, ETSI and the BBF. We are involved in the evolution of optical access technologies, participating in activities in the ITU-T, FSAN and BBF on next-generation PON. We are also involved in standards development efforts related to maximizing the bandwidth potential of the copper

   pair to enable new applications in the ITU-T. We continue to be involved with the industry-wide interoperability, performance-testing and system-level projects related to those standards in the BBF. We are also members of MEF, TIA, CableLabs and TIP.
 
For a discussion of risks associated with our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development effort and which may focus on more leading edge development,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Manufacturing and Operations
 The principal steps in our manufacturing process include the purchase and management of materials, assembly, testing, final inspection, packing and shipping. We purchase parts and components for the assembly of some products from a large number of suppliers through a worldwide sourcing program. Additionally, we manage a process that identifies the components that are best purchased directly by contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of our products to achieve manufacturing efficiency, quality and cost objectives. Certain key components used in our products are currently available from a single source, and other key components are available from only a limited number of sources. In the past, we have experienced delays in the receipt of certain key components, which has resulted in delays in related product deliveries. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to prevent the necessity of certain components and by maintaining close contact and building long-term relationships with our suppliers. With the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which have and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and our financial condition. We expect that the supply chain constraints and semiconductor shortage will continue to affect our operating results through the end of 2022, although we cannot predict such factors with certainty. See Backlog and Inventory included in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information.
 We rely on subcontractors for assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, sub-assemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and to purchase some of the raw materials used in such assemblies. We typically manufacture our lower-volume, higher-mix products and build and test product prototypes and many of our initial production units at our manufacturing site in Huntsville, Alabama. We later transfer the production of higher-volume, lower-mix assemblies to our subcontractors. Subcontract assembly operations can lengthen fulfillment cycle times, but we believe we can respond more rapidly to uncertainties in incoming order rates by selecting assembly subcontractors that have significant reserve capacity and flexibility. Our subcontractors have generally proven to be flexible and able to meet our quality requirements.
We ship the majority of products to our U.S. customers from our facilities in Huntsville, Alabama, although we also fulfill customer orders from other locations near our customers' sites, when possible. The majority of our products shipped to EMEA customers come from locations in that region. We also ship directly from subcontractors to a number of customers in the U.S. and international locations. Most of our facilities are certified pursuant to the most current releases of ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001 and ISO 27001. Our Huntsville, Alabama facilities and many of our key suppliers are C-TPAT certified. Our products are also certified to certain other customer, industry and privacy standards, including those relating to emission of electromagnetic energy and safety specifications.
 For a discussion of risks associated with manufacturing activities, see “Risk Factors – Our strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards” and “Risk Factors – Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 
Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products, combined with supply shortages, have prevented and may continue to prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on operating results and could have a material adverse effect on customer relations.
 Competition
 We compete in markets for networking and communications services and solutions for service providers, businesses, government agencies and other organizations worldwide. Our products and services provide solutions supporting voice, data and video communications across fiber-, copper-, coaxial- and wireless-based infrastructure, as well as across wide area networks, local area networks and the internet.
 
   We compete with a number of companies in the markets we serve. In our Access & Aggregation category, key competitors include Calix, Casa Systems, Ciena, CommScope, DZS, Harmonic, Huawei, Nokia, Radisys, Tibit Communications, Vecima Networks and ZTE. In the Subscriber Solutions & Experience category, our primary competitors include Calix, Cisco, CommScope, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Juniper Networks, Ribbon Communications, Ubiquiti Networks and Zyxel. In addition to these OEM vendors, we face increasing competition from various ODM vendors who are being engaged directly by some of our service provider customers. Some of these companies compete in a single product segment, while others compete across multiple product lines. Competitors of our Services & Support business include Calix, Fujitsu Network Communications and Nokia.
 For further discussion of risks associated with our competition, see “Risk Factors – We must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology” and “Risk Factors – We compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Seasonality
 We experience quarterly fluctuations in our revenue that occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual capital spending budgets. These seasonal effects may continue to vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or operating results.
Foreign Currency
 Transactions with customers that are denominated in foreign currencies are recorded using the appropriate exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and the functional currency with any transaction gains or losses reported in other income (expense). Our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange rate movements are with our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro and our Australian subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Australian dollar. Adjustments resulting from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
Backlog and Inventory
 A substantial portion of our shipments in any fiscal period relates to orders received and shipped within that fiscal period for customers under agreements containing nonbinding purchase commitments. Further, a significant percentage of orders require delivery within a few days. These factors normally result in a varying order backlog and limited order flow visibility; however, with the current global supply chain and transportation constraints, and limited availability of semiconductor chips and other components of our products, we have experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times, increased logistics intervals and costs, and lower volume of products deliveries, which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, customer relations and our financial condition. The backlog has been increasing due to increased demand and supply chain constraints. Additionally, backlog levels may vary because of seasonal trends, the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times.

   To meet this type of demand, we have enhanced and implemented supply chain management systems and processes to manage the materials planning and production processes. We maintain substantial inventories of raw materials for long lead time components to support this demand and avoid expedite fees. In the current environment, our raw material inventory has grown due to increased purchases in preparation for strategic inventory buffer purchases as well as new product ramp ups to ensure supply continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect inventory levels to fluctuate as we attempt to maintain sufficient inventory in response to COVID-19 uncertainties related to supply chain and supply, seasonal cycles of our business and ensuring competitive lead times while managing the risk of inventory. We also maintain substantial finished goods inventories. Our practice of maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products and services increases the amount of inventory that may be considered excess and/or obsolete. This excess and obsolete inventory may require us to write down the value of the inventory, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.
 For further discussion of risks associated with managing our inventory, see “Risk Factors – Managing our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Government Regulation
 Our products must comply with various regulations and standards established by communications authorities in various countries, as well as those of certain international bodies. Environmental legislation within the EU may increase our cost of doing business as we amend our products to comply with these requirements. For example, the EU issued the RoHS directive, the WEEE directive and the REACH regulation. We continue to implement measures to comply with these and other similar directives and regulations from additional countries.
 We strive to deliver innovative network access solutions that lower the total cost and reduce the time of deploying services, increase the level of performance achievable with established infrastructures, reduce operating and capital expenses for our customers, increase network bandwidth and functionality, and extend network reach. Our development process is conducted in accordance with ISO 9001, TL 9000, ISO 14001, and ISO 27001, all of which are international standards for quality and environmental management systems. Our corporate practices also conform to GDPR requirements, which protect digital data for all EU citizens, and to other applicable data protection laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 For further discussion of risks associated with government regulation, see “Risk Factors – We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.”
 Human Capital
 We believe that our most valuable asset is our people. To ensure our Company continues to succeed, our objective is to be able to recruit, hire and retain top talent. Our ability to attract and retain a high-quality workforce is dependent on our ability to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that provides opportunities for our employees to learn and grow in their careers. This is supported by competitive compensation and benefits, along with strong community service and other programs that enable employees to build connections within the community.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,335 full-time employees, with 1,036 in the U.S. and 299 in our international subsidiaries located in North America, Latin America, EMEA and APAC regions. We also utilized 45 contractors and numerous temporary employees domestically and internationally in various manufacturing, engineering, sales and general and administrative capacities. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. ADTRAN has a diverse employee base located in 17 countries. We pride ourselves on a highly educated workforce, and the majority of our employees serve in engineering, information technology and technical roles within the organization.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 168 employees (76%) of ADTRAN GmbH were subject to collective bargaining agreements of either the Association of Metal and Electrical Industry in Berlin and Brandenburg e.V. or NORDMETALL Association of Metal and Electrical Industry e.V. Although these collective bargaining agreements will expire on September 30, 2022, negotiations with the employees of ADTRAN GmbH for a new collective bargaining agreement are ongoing and we have not experienced any work stoppage. None of our other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
 Additionally, we continually work to recruit technical talent in diverse communities through our cooperative education program. This program seeks to identify college students that major in relevant technology areas and expose them to the work environment at ADTRAN on an alternating semester basis. Our goal is to retain as many of these students as possible for full-time employment after graduation, as they are our Company's future.
 
   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We believe that maintaining a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to the success of our business. The Company encourages an environment where individuality is embraced regardless of age, gender, identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity and perspective and where each employee is accepted and respected and can, therefore, bring their most authentic self to work. To this end, we have established an employee-driven Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) Task Force to spearhead our efforts. The DE&I Task Force is comprised of our Chief Financial Officer and employee volunteers who are passionate about DE&I and how it affects our workforce.
In addition to diversity in our workforce, we seek to ensure diversity in our Board of Directors with respect to skills, experience, gender, race and ethnicity. Our Board of Directors is comprised of six members, two of which are females and three of which are ethnically diverse. Additionally, the Board of Directors has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 The well-being of our employees is paramount to the continued success of our business. To this end, we are committed to each of our employees' health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees with access to various health and wellness benefits designed to enable them and their family members to have affordable access to health, dental and vision insurance. Additionally, we offer access to many programs that provide additional monetary support in the event of a qualifying incident, including accident insurance, life insurance and hospital indemnity insurance, among others. We understand that mental health is an essential aspect of our employees’ wellbeing. As a result, we offer an employee assistance program at no charge to employees and their family members. This program provides access to qualified personnel to address various issues such as grief, financial stress, family and emotional issues.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our employees and the communities in which we operate. We introduced enhanced health and safety standards that are in compliance with, or exceed, local, state and federal recommendations and regulations in the U.S. and at our international locations. This includes having the vast majority of our global employees work from home when possible. In areas where it is necessary to have critical, on-site personnel, such as at our manufacturing facilities, additional health and safety measures have been implemented to provide the safest environment possible for these workers.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We continually work to provide a competitive compensation and benefits program as this plays a key role in our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, include long-term equity incentive awards with certain vesting requirements, deferred compensation plans (which are offered to certain members of executive management), a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid volunteer time off, employee assistance program and tuition assistance. Additionally, at our headquarters in Alabama, we offer our employees certain on-site services, including nurse practitioner care and a fitness center, among others.
Talent Development
 We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a market-leading global supplier of broadband infrastructure. We offer numerous training opportunities on both technical and professional development topics. We utilize tools and processes to provide performance feedback which helps develop high potential employees into becoming our future leaders.
 The ADTRAN Career Development Program provides an opportunity for employees to shape their career journey. The program provides opportunities for employees to develop competencies in areas including technology, business acumen, emotional intelligence, design and systems thinking. As employees increase their competencies in these areas and master skills within their individual roles, this program offers a variety of career advancement paths. Employees also have access to the ADTRAN Learning Network. This platform houses all required training, as well as optional training in a variety of areas.
 Intellectual Property
 ADTRAN develops and owns a significant amount of intellectual property. We hold over 600 patents worldwide related to our products and over 50 additional pending patent applications. Our patents expire at various dates between 2022 and 2038. We continue to seek additional patents related to our research and development activities. We do not derive any material amount of revenue from the licensing of our patents.
 
   The ADTRAN corporate logo is a registered trademark of ADTRAN, as is the name “ADTRAN”, “SmartRG” and a number of our product identifiers and names. We also claim rights to a number of unregistered trademarks.
 We protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights in accordance with good legal and business practices. We believe, however, that our competitive success will not fully depend on the ownership of intellectual property, but instead will depend primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.
 The communications industry is characterized by the existence of an ever-increasing volume of patent litigation and licensing activities. We have received, and may continue to receive, notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. It is possible that such litigation may result in significant legal costs and judgments and that intellectual property infringement claims, or related litigation against or by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights, see “Risk Factors – Our failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality, and commercial value of our products” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
