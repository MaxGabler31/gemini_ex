Products and Services
Historically, the Company’s product lines have encompassed connectors, anchors, fasteners, lateral resistive systems, and truss plates, as well as repair and strengthening product lines for the industrial and transportation markets. See “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Note 18 — Segment Information” to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information regarding revenues by product category.
Many of the Company’s products are approved by building code evaluation agencies. To achieve these approvals, the Company conducts extensive product testing, which is witnessed and certified by independent testing laboratories. These tests also provide the basis of load ratings for the Company’s structural products. This test and load information is used by architects, engineers, contractors, building officials, and homeowners in selecting our products and comparing them to those of competitors, and is useful across all applications of the Company’s products, ranging from the deck constructed by a homeowner to a multi-story structure designed by an architect or engineer.
Wood Construction Products. The Company produces and markets over 14,000 standard and custom wood construction products. These products are used primarily to strengthen, support and connect wood applications in residential and commercial 
construction and DIY projects. The Company’s wood construction products contribute to structural integrity and resistance to seismic, wind and gravitational forces. As described below, the Company’s wood construction products include: 
•Connectors - Connectors are prefabricated metal products that attach wood, concrete, masonry or steel together and are essential for tying wood construction elements together and create safer and stronger buildings. Included in this category are connectors, holddowns, and truss connector plates.
•Fasteners - The fastening line includes various nails, screws and staples, which are complemented by the Company's Quik Drive auto-feed screw driving system, which is used in numerous applications such as decking, subfloors, drywall and roofing; and
•Lateral Resistive Systems - Lateral resistive systems are assemblies used to resist earthquake or wind forces and include steel and wood shearwalls, Anchor Tiedown Systems (ATS), and steel moment frames.

Engineering and Design Services. The Company’s engineers not only design and test products, but also provide engineering support for customers in connection with a number of products that the Company manufactures and sells. This support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing the suitability of an existing product in a unique application. For the truss product line, the Company’s engineers review the output of the Company’s software to assist customers in ensuring that trusses are properly designed and specified, and in some instances seal design diagrams. Generally, in connection with any engineering services the Company provides, the Company’s engineers serve as a point of reference and support for the customer’s engineers and other service professionals, who ultimately determine and are responsible for the engineering approach and design loads for any project.
Distribution Channels and Markets
The Company seeks to expand its product and distribution coverage through several channels:
•Distributors. The Company regularly evaluates its distribution coverage and the service levels provided by its distributors, and from time to time implements changes. The Company evaluates distributor product mix and conducts promotions to encourage distributors to add the Company’s products that complement the mix of product offerings in their markets.
•Home Centers. The Company intends to increase penetration of the DIY markets by continuing to expand its product offerings through home centers. The Company’s sales force maintains ongoing contact with home centers to work with them in a broad range of areas, including inventory levels, retail display maintenance and product knowledge training. The Company’s strategy is to ensure that the home center retail stores are fully stocked with adequate supplies of the Company’s products carried by those stores. The Company has further developed extensive bar coding and merchandising aids and has devoted a portion of its research and development efforts to DIY products. The Company’s sales to home centers increased year-over-year in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company brought back Lowe's as a home center customer in the second quarter of 2020.
•Dealers. In some markets, the Company sells its products directly to lumber dealers and cooperatives.
•OEM Relationships. The Company works closely with manufacturers of engineered wood, composite laminated timber and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") for off-site construction to develop and expand the application and sales of its engineered wood connector, fastener, anchor, and truss products. The Company has relationships with many of the leaders in these industries. 
•International Sales. The Company has established a presence in Europe through acquisition of companies with existing customer bases and through servicing U.S.-based customers operating in Europe. The Company also distributes connector, anchor and epoxy products in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Australia and New Zealand.
Markets
The Company seeks to expand existing and identify new distributions channels in the markets we serve, and expand into new markets. Presently, we primarily serve three markets, which are also our operating segments, consisting of the North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific segments. The North America segment includes operations primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Europe segment includes operations primarily in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Portugal, Poland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and Norway. The Asia/Pacific segment includes operations primarily in Australia, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. These segments are similar in several ways, including similarities in the products manufactured and distributed, the types of materials used, the production processes, the distribution channels and the product applications.
As previously disclosed, on January 26, 2022, the Company, via its wholly-owned subsidiary Simpson Strong-Tie Europe, entered into a securities purchase agreement providing for the Company’s acquisition of the Etanco Group ( “Etanco”). Etanco is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of fixing and fastening solutions for the European building and construction market. Etanco’s business model and core product offerings align with the Company, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Etanco will support continued growth in our European business, including expansion into new geographies, sales channels and commercial building offerings. For more information about the pending acquisition, see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
New Products
In order to innovate, advance and diversify our product offerings, the Company commits substantial resources to new product development. The majority of SST’s products have been developed through its internal research and development program. The Company believes it is the only U.S. manufacturer with the capability to internally test multi-story wall systems, thus enabling full scale testing rather than analysis alone to prove system performance. The Company’s engineering, sales, product management, and marketing teams work together with architects, engineers, building inspectors, code officials, builders and customers in the new product development process.
The Company’s product research and development is based largely on products or solutions that are identified within the Company, feedback or requests from customers for new or specialty products and in connection with the Company’s strategic initiatives to expand into new markets and/or develop new product lines. The Company’s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis, to seek patents when appropriate and to rely on trade secret protection for others or depending on availability and circumstances, the Company will acquire products or solutions meeting our strategic initiatives.
Since at least 2006, the Company has developed 15 to 25 new products each year. In 2021, through our research and development efforts, the Company expanded its product offerings by adding:
•new connectors and lateral products for wood framing applications;
•new connectors and fasteners for mass timber & offsite constructions;
•connections for structural steel construction;
•new connectors for cold formed steel applications;
•new fastener products and tools for wood construction;
•new mechanical and adhesive anchors for concrete and masonry construction; and
•new repair and strengthening systems for concrete, masonry and wood pile applications.
By executing on its research and development strategy, the Company intends to continue to expand its product offerings.
The Company provides expertise and resources to offer software solutions and services to builders and lumber building material dealers, and supports efforts to further develop integrated software component solutions for the building industry. The Company also has ongoing development of truss software for the design, modeling and truss plate selection for its integrated component manufacturing customers.
Competition
Simpson is a category creator in the building products space. Our mission is to provide solutions that help people design and build safer, stronger structures. Our products improve the performance and integrity of the structures they are installed in, helping to make those structures more sustainable, and often helping to save lives in times of natural disasters and catastrophe.
Today, we offer over 14,000 wood construction products, and over 1,000 concrete construction products for the residential construction, light industrial and commercial construction, remodeling, and repair & remodel markets. 
We sell our products through multiple channels including contractor distributors, home centers and co-ops, lumber dealers and OEMs. Currently, 22 of the top 25 U.S. builders (based on number of housing starts per year) are engaged in our builder program. In terms of home centers, we were pleased to welcome back Lowe’s as a home center customer in the second quarter of 2020. By the end of the fiscal year 2020, we had successfully completed the rollout of our product sets in over 1,700 Lowe’s stores. 
We encounter a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. While we do not believe that any single company competes with us across all of our product lines and distribution channels, certain companies compete in one or more product categories and/or distribution channels.
For over 65 years, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Simpson Strong-Tie Company Inc., we have led the industry with a majority market share in the wood connectors products space and a growing presence in both the concrete and fastener markets in the U.S. and Europe. We’ve successfully increased our market share over the years through:
•designing and marketing end-to-end construction product systems;
•product availability with delivery in typically 24 hours to 48 hours; 
•strong customer support and education for engineers, builders, contractors and building officials;
•extensive product testing capabilities at our state-of-the-art test lab;
•strong relationships with engineers that get our products specified on the blueprint and pulled through to the job site; and 
•active involvement with code officials to improve building codes and construction practices.
We believe these value-added services are competitive differentiators for us and provide us with a competitive advantage, helping us to achieve industry-leading margins, strong brand recognition and a trusted reputation. We also provide engineering services in support of some of our products and increasingly offer design and other software that facilitates the specification, selection and use of our products. We are also investing in software technology, such as 3D visualization software tools, truss design and specification software and BIM software, in order to drive increased specification and use of our building material products with homeowners, truss component manufacturers, builders and distributors as well as to support our customers with additional solutions and services.
U.S. housing starts are a leading indicator for a significant portion of our business. In an effort to help mitigate our exposure to the cyclicality of the U.S. housing market, as well as to respond to the needs of our customers, we’ve made investments over the years in adjacent products such as anchors, fasteners and software solutions and expanded operations into Europe through acquisitions.
Resources
Raw Materials
The principal raw material used by the Company is steel, including stainless steel. The Company also uses materials such as carbon fiber, fiberglass, mortars, grouts, epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring and reinforcing products. The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources. The Company’s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by developing business relationships with and purchasing from a limited number of suppliers.
The steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the Company’s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company’s control. The steel market continues to be dynamic, with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends. Given current conditions, including significant import tariffs and duties, and unsettled international trade disputes, the Company currently expects that the high degree of uncertainty regarding steel prices will continue. Numerous factors may cause steel prices to remain high in the future. In addition to increases in steel prices, steel mills may add surcharges for zinc, energy and freight in response to increases in their costs. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials. However, the Company may purchase and carry more steel or other raw materials in inventory to meet projected sales demand in a tight raw materials market.
Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Generally, the Company seeks statutory protection for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with its business. Certain intellectual property, where appropriate, is protected by contracts, licenses, confidentiality or other agreements. From time to time, the Company takes action to protect its businesses by asserting its intellectual property rights against third-party infringers.
The Company’s trademarks are registered or otherwise legally protected in the U.S. and many non-U.S. countries where products and services of the Company are sold. The Company, from time to time, becomes involved in trademark licensing transactions.
Most works of authorship produced for the Company, such as computer programs, catalogs and sales literature, carry appropriate notices indicating the Company’s claim to copyright protection under U.S. law and appropriate international treaties.
The Company has U.S. and foreign patents, the majority of which cover products that the Company currently manufactures and markets. These patents, and applications for new patents, cover various design aspects of the Company’s products, as well as processes used in their manufacture. The Company continues to develop new potentially patentable products, product enhancements and product designs as well as acquire patented product. Although the Company does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products, the Company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop. In addition to seeking patent protection, the Company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
While the Company believes its intellectual property portfolio is important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset, no single patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property, or group of such intellectual property, is critical to the success of the business or any segment.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
The Company’s sales are seasonal and cyclical, with operating results varying from quarter to quarter. With some exceptions, our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of a fiscal year, as the Company's customers tend to purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season. Weather conditions, such as extended cold or wet weather, which affect and sometimes delay installation of some of our products, could negatively affect our results of operations. Operating results vary from quarter to quarter and with economic cycles. The Company’s sales are also dependent, to a large degree, on the North American residential home construction industry. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Human Capital Resources
Successful execution of our strategy is largely dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency and provide the opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful. 
At December 31, 2021, our employees, including those employed by consolidated subsidiaries, by region were approximately:

Asia Pacific | 384

Talent Development
Talent development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services. The opportunity to grow and develop skills and abilities, regardless of job role, division, or geographical location is critical to the success of the Company as a global organization and we continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees access to a wide variety of learning and development resources, including a suite of online courses for developing both soft and technical skills. These resources are designed to encourage a growth mindset and continuous learning. Accordingly, we also have leadership development programs that provide employees with training, tools and experiences that are targeted to develop their full leadership potential. 
Pay Equity
The Company’s compensation philosophy is to attract, retain, motivate, and differentiate employees through its rewards programs. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics and are committed to internal pay equity. Our Board of Directors, through its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, monitors the relationship between the pay received by our executive officers and non-managerial employees. We believe our compensation philosophy and strategy are strongly aligned with our corporate strategic priorities and our vision for stockholder value creation.
In addition to our financial compensation we offer a health and wellness package to our employees, which is designed to provide employees with a range of options that are customizable to suit their individual and/or family needs. In addition, in an effort to continue to attract, retain, and motivate our workforce, in the U.S., we offer remote and flexible work packages for positions which allow for remote work. We continue to engage our partners and benefits consultants to ensure our health and wellness package continues to meet the needs of our diverse workforce today and into the future.
Workplace Safety and Health
A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. Our Environmental, Health and Safety program focuses on implementing change through our employee observation feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes, as well as conducting regular risk reviews and self-audits at our manufacturing facilities around the world to explore new opportunities to reduce potential employee exposure to occupational injuries.
Importantly during 2021, our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented various measures in an effort to better protect our employees. At the onset of the pandemic we established a Crisis Management Team (the "CMT") to monitor new COVID-19 related developments and support our operations to respond to the ever-changing landscape:
•The CMT consists of senior members of management including our CEO, CFO, President of Sales, General Counsel, and Heads of HR, Manufacturing, IT, Internal Communications, and Safety.
•Currently the CMT meets approximately every other week and at onset of the pandemic met daily.
•The CMT provides updates to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. 
•Our goals are to:
◦Support safe working environments in our operations,
◦Regularly communicate to inform and update employees, and 
◦Provide oversight of training on COVID-19 safety practices.
The Company took immediate action at the onset of this crisis to enact rigorous safety protocols in all of our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, temperature screening, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site staff through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. These actions, in addition to generally being deemed an essential business, have enabled us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions during the pandemic. We continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and remain committed to the health, safety and well-being of our employees.
Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 17% of the Company’s employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have two facility locations with collective bargaining agreements covering tool and die craftsmen, maintenance workers, and sheet-metal workers. In Stockton, California, two union contracts will expire in June 2023 and September 2023, respectively. Also, we have two union contracts in San Bernardino County, California that will expire in June 2022 and in February 2025. Based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances, we believe that, even if new agreements are not reached before the existing labor union contracts expire, it is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to provide products to customers or on the Company’s profitability. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors.”
