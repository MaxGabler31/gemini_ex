     Proposed Sale of EES Business Segment
    
On June 1, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Webasto Charging Systems, Inc. (“Webasto”) pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and Webasto agreed to acquire, substantially all of the assets of our Efficient Energy Systems business segment (the “EES Business”) and to assume certain liabilities related to the EES Business.  The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is subject to certain closing conditions, including: (i) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), (ii) each party’s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Purchase Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), (iii) the execution by the parties of certain ancillary agreements and (iv) other customary closing conditions.  As of April 30, 2018, we determined that the EES Business met the criterion for classification as an asset held for sale and represents a strategic shift in in our operations. Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the EES Business are reported in this Annual Report as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    
The disclosures and references in this Annual Report, including financial data, the description of our business operations in this Item 1, and risk factors related to our operations included in Item 1A relate to our continuing operations, unless otherwise specifically noted.
     Overview
     We design, develop, produce, support and operate a technologically‑advanced portfolio of products and services for government agencies and businesses. We supply unmanned aircraft systems (“UAS”) and related services primarily to organizations within the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and to international allied governments, and tactical missile systems and related services to organizations within the U.S. Government. We derive the majority of our revenue from these business areas and we believe that the markets for these solutions have significant growth potential. Additionally, we believe that some of the innovative potential products and services in our research and development pipeline will emerge as new growth platforms in the future, creating additional market opportunities.
     Our success with current products and services stems from our investment in research and development and our ability to invent and deliver advanced solutions, utilizing proprietary and commercially available technologies, to help our government, commercial and consumer customers operate more effectively and efficiently. We develop these highly innovative solutions by working very closely with our key customers to solve their most important challenges related to our areas of expertise. Our core technological capabilities, developed through more than 45 years of innovation, include lightweight aerostructures; power electronics; electric propulsion systems; efficient electric power conversion, and storage systems; high‑density energy packaging; miniaturization; digital data links (“DDL”); sensors; controls integration; systems integration; engineering optimization; vertical takeoff fixed wing flight and autonomy, each coupled with professional field service capabilities.
     Our UAS business focuses primarily on the design, development, production, marketing, support and operation of innovative UAS and tactical missile systems and the delivery of UAS‑related services that provide situational awareness, remote sensing, multi‑band communications, force protection and other information and mission effects to increase the safety and effectiveness of our customers’ operations.
     Our Strategy
     As a technology solutions provider, our strategy is to develop innovative, safe and reliable new solutions that provide customers with valuable benefits and enable us to create new markets or market segments, gain market share and grow as market adoption increases. We believe that by introducing new solutions that provide customers with compelling value we are able to create new markets or market segments and then grow our positions within those

markets or market segments profitably, instead of entering existing markets and competing directly against large, incumbent competitors that may possess advantages in scope, scale, resources and relationships.
     We intend to grow our business by preserving a leadership position in the UAS and tactical missile system markets, and by creating new solutions that enable us to create and establish leadership positions in new markets. Key components of this strategy include the following:
     Expand our market leadership to grow existing markets and create new adjacent markets. Our small UAS and tactical missile systems enjoy leading positions in their respective markets. We intend to increase the penetration of our small UAS products and services within the U.S. military, the military forces of allied nations, other government agencies and non‑government organizations, including commercial entities, and to increase the penetration of our tactical missile systems within the U.S. military and allied nations. We believe that the broad adoption of our small UAS by the U.S. military will continue to spur demand by allied nations, and that our efforts to pursue new applications are creating opportunities beyond the early adopter military market.
     Deliver innovative new solutions for existing and new markets. Customer‑focused innovation is the primary driver of our growth. We plan to continue pursuing internal and customer‑funded research and development to develop better, more capable products, services and business models, both in response to and in anticipation of emerging customer needs. In some cases, these innovations result in upgrades to existing offerings, expanding their value among existing customers and markets. In other cases, these innovations become entirely new solutions that position us to address new markets, customers and business opportunities. We believe focused research and development investments will allow us to deliver innovative new products and services that address market needs within and outside of our current target markets, and enable us to create new opportunities for growth. We view strategic partnerships as a means by which to further the reach of our innovative solutions through access to new markets, customers and complementary capabilities.
     Foster our entrepreneurial culture and continue to attract, develop and retain highly‑skilled personnel. Our company culture encourages innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit, which helps to attract and retain highly‑skilled professionals. We intend to preserve this culture to encourage the development of the innovative, highly technical system solutions and business models that give us our competitive advantage. A core component of our culture is our intent to demonstrate trust and integrity in all of our interactions, contributing to a positive work environment and engendering loyalty among our employees and customers.
     Preserve our agility and flexibility. We respond rapidly to evolving markets, solve complicated customer problems, and strive to deliver new products, services and capabilities quickly, efficiently and affordably relative to available alternatives. We believe our agility and flexibility help us to strengthen our relationships with customers and partners. We intend to maintain our agility and flexibility, which we believe to be important sources of differentiation when we compete against organizations with more extensive resources.
     Effectively manage our growth portfolio for long‑term value creation. Our production and development programs and services position us for investment opportunities that we believe will deliver long‑term growth by providing our customers with valuable new capabilities. We evaluate each opportunity independently and within the context of other investment opportunities to determine its relative timing and potential, and thereby its priority. This process helps us to make informed decisions regarding potential growth capital requirements and supports how we allocate resources based on relative risks and returns to maximize long‑term value creation, which is a key element of our growth strategy. We also review our portfolio on a regular basis to determine if and when to narrow our focus on the highest potential growth opportunities. 
     Customers
     We sell the majority of our UAS and services to organizations within the DoD, including the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, Air Force and Navy, and increasingly to allied governments. We sell our tactical missile systems to organizations within the U.S. government. We also develop High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (“HAPS”) systems for a commercial customer based in Japan.

     During our fiscal year ended April 30, 2018, we generated approximately 19% of our revenue from the U.S. Army pursuant to orders placed under contract by the U.S. Army on behalf of itself as well as several other organizations within the DoD. Other U.S. government agencies and government subcontractors accounted for 35% of our sales revenue, while purchases by foreign, commercial and consumer customers accounted for the remaining 46% of sales revenue during our fiscal year ended April 30, 2018.
     Technology, Research and Development
     Technological Competence and Intellectual Property
     Our company was founded by the late Dr. Paul B. MacCready, the former Chairman of our board of directors and an internationally renowned innovator who was instrumental in establishing our entrepreneurial and creative culture. This culture has consistently enabled us to attract and retain highly‑motivated, talented employees and has established our reputation as an innovative leader in the industries in which we compete.
     The innovations developed by our company and our founder include, among others: the world’s first effective human‑powered and manned solar‑powered airplanes; the first modern passenger electric car, the EV1 prototype for General Motors; the world’s highest flying airplane in level flight, Helios™, a solar‑powered unmanned aircraft system that reached over 96,000 feet above sea level in 2001; Global Observer, the world’s first liquid hydrogen‑fueled unmanned aircraft system; the Nano Hummingbird™, the world’s first flapping wing unmanned aircraft system capable of precise hover and omni‑directional flight; and Blackwing™, the first submarine-launched unmanned aircraft system deployed by the U.S. Navy. The Smithsonian Institution possesses seven vehicles developed by our company or our founder in its permanent collection. Our history of innovation excellence is the result of our talented, creative and skilled employees whom we encourage to invent and develop innovative new solutions.
     A component of our ongoing innovation is a screening process that helps our business managers identify early market needs, which assists us in making timely investments into critical technologies necessary to develop solutions to address these needs. Similarly, we manage new product and business concepts through a commercialization process that balances spending, resources, time and intellectual property considerations against market requirements and potential returns on investment. Strongly linking our technology and business development activities to customer needs in attractive growth markets constitutes an important element of this process. Through the process we revisit our customer requirement assumptions to evaluate continued investment and to help ensure that our products and services deliver high value.
 As a result of our commitment to research and development, we possess an extensive portfolio of intellectual property in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks across a broad range of UAS and advanced energy technologies. As of April 30, 2018, we had 201 U.S. patents issued; 87 U.S. patent applications pending; 7 active Patent Cooperation Treaty applications; and numerous foreign patents and applications, of which 51 U.S. patents, 20 U.S. patent applications and no active Patent Cooperation Treaty applications are anticipated to be assigned to Webasto upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. In many cases, when appropriate and to preserve confidentiality, we opt to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets as opposed to filing for patent protection. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, a portion of our patents and pending patent applications relating to the EES Business will be sold and to Webasto at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.
     The U.S. government has licenses to some of our intellectual property that was specifically developed in performance of government contracts, and may use or authorize others to use this intellectual property. In some cases we fund the development of certain intellectual property to maximize its value and limit its use by potential competitors. While we consider the development and protection of our intellectual property to be integral to the future success of our business, at this time we do not believe that a loss or limitation of rights to any particular piece of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.

 Research, Development and Commercialization Projects
     A core component of our business strategy is the focused development and commercialization of innovative solutions that we believe can become new products or services that enable us to create large new markets or accelerate the growth of our current products and services. We invest in an active pipeline of these commercialization projects that range in maturity from technology validation to early market adoption. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will successfully commercialize these projects, or the exact level of capital expenditures they could require, which could be substantial.
     For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our internal research and development spending amounted to 10%, 12% and 15%, of our revenue, respectively, and customer‑funded research and development spending amounted to an additional 19%, 19% and 23%, of our revenue, respectively.
     Sales and Marketing
     Our marketing strategy is based on developing leadership positions in new markets that we create through the introduction of innovation solutions that improve customer operational effectiveness and efficiency. Our ability to operate in an agile, flexible manner helps us achieve first mover advantage and work closely with early customers to achieve the successful adoption of our solutions. Once we establish a market position we work to maintain our leadership position while seeking to grow our revenue by expanding sales and through continuous innovation and customer support. Our reputation for innovation is a key component of our brand and has been acknowledged through a variety of awards and recognized in numerous articles in domestic and international publications. We have U.S. registered trademarks for AeroVironment, AV, Switchblade, Raven, Wasp, Snipe, and EV Solutions, and have several other pending applications for trademark registration. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, a portion of our registered trademarks and pending trademark registration applications that relate to the EES Business will be sold and assigned to Webasto at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the U.S. registered trademarks for EV Solutions, TurboCord, PosiCharge, BMID, BATTERY RX, Procore, Powered Your Way, Turbodock, NXT, and Turbo DX.     International Sales
     We contract with international sales representatives and team with domestic organizations in a number of foreign markets and believe that these markets represent growth opportunities for our business. Our international sales accounted for approximately 46%, 37% and 29%, of our revenue for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.     Competition
     We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our products and services include product performance; safety; features; acquisition cost; lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support; ease of use; rapid integration with existing equipment and processes; quality; reliability; customer support; and brand and reputation.     Manufacturing and Operations
     We pursue a lean and efficient production strategy across our business, focusing on rapid prototyping, supply chain management, final assembly, integration, quality and final acceptance testing. Using concurrent engineering techniques within an integrated product team structure, we rapidly prototype design concepts and products, while working to optimize our designs to meet manufacturing requirements, mission capabilities and customer specifications. Within this framework we develop our products with feedback and input from manufacturing, quality, supply chain management, key suppliers, logistics personnel and customers. We incorporate this input into product designs in an effort to maximize the efficiency and quality of our products. As a result, we believe that we significantly reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to full‑rate production deliveries while achieving high reliability, quality and yields.

 We outsource certain production activities, such as the fabrication of structures, the manufacture of electronic printed circuit board subassemblies, payload components and, the production of our Quantix drone, to qualified suppliers, with many of whom we have long‑term relationships. This outsourcing enables us to focus on final assembly, system integration and test processes for our products, ensuring high levels of quality and reliability. We forge strong relationships with key suppliers based on their ability to grow with our production needs and support our growth plans. We continue to expand upon our suppliers’ expertise to improve our existing products and develop new solutions. We rely on both single and multiple suppliers for certain components and subassemblies. See “Risk Factors—If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products, which could damage our business” for more information. All of our production system operations incorporate internal and external quality programs and processes to increase acceptance rates, reduce lead times and lower cost.
     Customer Funded Research and Development
     We actively pursue externally funded projects that help us to strengthen our technological capabilities. Our UAS business submits bids to large research customers such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Special Operations Command for projects that we believe have future commercial application. In some cases commercial enterprises may fund our research and development activities, as with our HAPSMobile, Inc. development program. Providing these services contributes to the development and enhancement of our technical competencies. In an effort to manage the ability of our key technical personnel to support multiple, high‑value research and development initiatives, we attempt to limit the volume of customer funded research and development projects that we accept. This process enables us to focus these personnel on projects we believe offer the greatest current and future value to our business.     Seasonality
     Historically, and more pronounced in recent years, our revenue in the second half of our fiscal years has exceeded our revenue in the first half of our fiscal years. The factors that affect our revenue recognition between accounting periods include the timing of new contract awards, the availability of U.S. government and international government funding, lead time to manufacture our family of systems to customer specification, customer acceptance and other regulatory requirements. We expect our fiscal year 2019 to have more balanced revenue between the first and second halves.     Raw Materials and Suppliers
     Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key raw materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor have we experienced a significant price increase for raw materials or components.  We do not anticipate any such delays or significant price increases in our fiscal year 2019.     Contract Mix
     The table below shows our revenue for the periods indicated by contract type, including both government and commercial sales:

 | Fiscal Year Ended | 
 | April 30, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Fixed-price contracts | 80 | % | 76 | % | 75 | %
Cost-reimbursable contracts | 20 | % | 24 | % | 25 | %

      Employees
     As of April 30, 2018, we had 697 full time employees of our continuing business operations, of whom 253 were in research and development and engineering, 34 were in sales and marketing, 252 were in operations and 158 were general and administrative personnel. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. As of April 30, 

 
  7

 
2018, we had 100 employees of our EES Business.  Upon the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, it is anticipated that we will terminate the employees of the EES Business who will become employees of Webasto after the closing.
     Backlog
     We define funded backlog as unfilled firm orders for products and services for which funding currently is appropriated to us under the contract by the customer. As of April 30, 2018 and 2017, our funded backlog was approximately $174.3 million and $70.9 million, respectively. We expect that approximately 84% of our funded backlog will be filled during our fiscal year ending April 30, 2019.
     In addition to our funded backlog, we had unfunded backlog of $58.1 million and $14.1 million as of April 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We define unfunded backlog as the total remaining potential order amounts under cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with (i) multiple one‑year options, and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, or IDIQ contracts, or (ii) incremental funding. Unfunded backlog does not obligate the customer to purchase goods or services. There can be no assurance that unfunded backlog will result in any orders in any particular period, if at all. Management believes that unfunded backlog does not provide a reliable measure of future estimated revenue under our contracts. Unfunded backlog does not include the remaining potential value associated with a U.S. Army IDIQ‑type contract for small UAS because that contract was awarded to seven companies in 2018, including AeroVironment, and we cannot be certain that we will receive all task orders issued against the contract.
     Because of possible future changes in delivery schedules and/or cancellations of orders, backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period, and actual sales for the year may not meet or exceed the backlog represented. Our backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts expire, are renewed, or new contracts are awarded. A majority of our contracts, specifically our IDIQ contracts, do not obligate the U.S. government to purchase any goods or services. Additionally, all U.S. government contracts included in backlog, whether or not they are funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. government.

 Industry Background
     Small UAS
     The defense market for small UAS has grown significantly since the early 2000s driven largely by the demands associated with the global threat environment and the resulting procurement by military customers, the early adopters for this technology. Small UAS now represent an accepted and enduring capability for the military. The U.S. military’s transformation into a smaller, more agile force that operates via a network of observation, communication and precision targeting technologies accelerated following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as it required improved, distributed observation and targeting of enemy combatants who operate in small groups, often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations. We believe that UAS, which range from large systems, such as Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk and General Atomics’ Predator, Sky Warrior, Reaper and Gray Eagle, to small systems, such as our Raven, Wasp AE, Puma AE and Snipe, serve as integral components of today’s military force. These systems provide critical observation and communications capabilities serving the increasing demand for actionable intelligence, while reducing risk to individual “warfighters.” Small UAS can provide real‑time observation and communication capabilities to the small units who control them. As airspace regulations in the U.S. and other nations evolve to accommodate the commercial use of small UAS, we are furthering the application of small UAS technology in new markets such as precision agriculture. We expect further growth through the introduction of UAS technology and services to these emerging commercial applications.     Tactical Missile Systems
     The development of weapons capable of rapid deployment and precision strike while minimizing the risk to surrounding civilians, property and operators accelerated in recent years due to advances in enabling technologies. Weapons such as laser‑guided missiles, “smart” bombs and GPS‑guided artillery shells have dramatically improved the accuracy of strikes against hostile targets. When ground forces find themselves engaged in a firefight or near a target, their ability to employ a precision weapon system quickly and easily can mean the difference between mission success and failure. A rapidly deployable solution could address emerging requirements beyond ground engagements for use in other types of situations and from a variety of sea, air and land platforms. We believe that embedding a precision lethal payload into a remotely controlled, man‑portable delivery system provides warfighters with a valuable and more cost‑effective alternative to existing munition and missile systems.
     Large UAS
     We believe a market opportunity exists for large UAS that can fly for long periods of time to provide continuous remote sensing and communications in an affordable manner over great distances. Existing solutions such as communications satellites and manned and unmanned aircraft address some of the emerging demand for this capability, but do so at relatively high financial and resource costs. Geosynchronous satellites provide fixed, continuous communications capabilities to large portions of the globe, but they operate more than 20,000 miles from the surface of the earth, therefore limiting the bandwidth they can provide and requiring relatively larger, higher power ground stations. Remote sensing satellites typically operate at lower altitudes, but are unable to maintain geosynchronous positions, meaning they are moving with respect to the surface of the earth, resulting in a limited presence over specific areas of interest and significant periods of time during which they are not present over those areas. A new category of constellations consisting of a large number of very small and low earth orbiting satellites is designed to provide a lower cost alternative with more ubiquitous coverage for reconnaissance and communication, but has yet to be deployed in meaningful quantities. UAS that are capable of operating in an affordable manner for extended periods of time over an area of interest without gaps in availability while carrying a communications or observation payload could help to satisfy this need.
     Our UAS Solutions
     We supply our UAS products and services to multiple customers within and outside of the United States.

 Small UAS Products
     Our small UAS, including Raven, Wasp AE, Puma AE and Snipe, are designed to operate reliably a few hundred feet above the ground in a wide range of environmental conditions, providing a vantage point from which to collect and deliver valuable information. Military forces employ our small UAS to deliver ISR and communications, including real‑time tactical reconnaissance, tracking, combat assessment and geographic data, directly to the small tactical unit or individual operator, thereby increasing flexibility in mission planning and execution. In commercial applications, we operate our small UAS as part of a turnkey information solution to deliver advanced analysis that can reduce customers’ costs, enhance their safety and increase their revenue. Our small UAS wirelessly transmit critical live video and other information generated by their payload of electro‑optical, infrared or other sensors directly to a hand‑held ground control unit, enabling the operator to view and capture images, during the day or at night, on the control unit. Our Quantix data collection drone generates a volume of high-resolution data significantly larger than wireless bandwidth can accommodate, requiring the transfer of data once the air vehicle has landed. With the exception of Quantix, our ground control systems allow the operator to control the aircraft by programming it for GPS‑based autonomous navigation using operator‑designated way‑points, or by manual flight operation. The ground control systems are designed for durability and ease of use in harsh environments and incorporate a user‑friendly, intuitive user interface. All of our fixed wing small UAS currently in production for military customers operate from our common ground control system.
     We designed our small UAS to be transportable by a single person, assembled without tools in less than five minutes and launched and operated by one or two people, with limited training required. The efficient and reliable electric motors used in all of our small UAS are powered by modular battery packs that can be replaced quickly, enabling rapid return to flight. We designed all of our small UAS to be reusable for hundreds of flights under normal operating circumstances and to be recovered through an autonomous landing feature that enables a controlled descent to a designated location.
     In military applications, our small UAS provide forward aerial observation capabilities that enable tactical commanders to observe around the next corner, to the next intersection or past a ridgeline in real‑time. This information facilitates faster, safer movement through urban, rural and mountainous environments and can enable troops to be proactive based on field intelligence rather than reactive to attack. Moreover, by providing this information, our systems reduce the risk to warfighters and to the surrounding population by providing the ability to tailor the military response to the threat. U.S. military personnel regularly use our small UAS, such as Raven, for missions such as force protection, combat observation and damage assessment. These reusable systems are easy to transport, assemble and operate and are relatively quiet when flying at typical operational altitudes of 200 to 300 feet above ground level, the result of our efficient electric propulsion systems. Furthermore, their small size makes them difficult to see from the ground. In addition, the low cost of our small UAS relative to larger systems and alternatives makes it practical for customers to deploy these assets directly to warfighters.
     In emerging commercial applications, our small UAS enable enterprises to manage valuable assets such as crops, powerlines and railroad infrastructure, more effectively and safely than previously possible. Our Quantix data collection drone and AeroVironment Decision Support System (“AVDSS”), a cloud‑based platform for processing, analyzing and storing collected data, are designed to provide agriculture operations with more accurate and timely information regarding their crops. Better and more timely information can translate into more efficient activities that facilitate more efficient use of scarce resources such as water for agriculture.
     Our small UAS offering also includes spare equipment, alternative payload modules, batteries, chargers, repair services and customer support. We provide training by our highly‑skilled instructors, who typically possess extensive military experience, and continuous refurbishment and repair services for our products. We designed our Quantix system for minimal training so customers can learn how to operate it on their own. By maintaining close contact with our customers and users in the field, we gather critical feedback on our products and incorporate that information into ongoing product development and research and development efforts. This approach enables us to improve our solutions in response to, and in anticipation of, evolving customer needs.

(1) | Represents point‑to‑point minimum customer‑mandated specifications for all operating conditions. In optimal conditions, the performance of our products may significantly exceed these specifications. Our DDL relay can enable operational modes that can extend range significantly.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The ground control system serves as the primary interface between the operator and our small UAS designed for defense applications, and allows the operator to control the direction, speed and altitude of the aircraft as well as the orientation of the sensors to view the visual information they produce through real‑time, streaming video and metadata. Our common ground control system interfaces with each of our air vehicles, except Snipe, providing a common user interface with each of our air vehicles. In addition to the thousands of air vehicles delivered to our customers, thousands of ground control systems are also in our customers’ hands.
     The Snipe nano quadrotor is an unmanned aircraft system tailored to the needs of frontline troops who need immediate situational awareness. Snipe incorporates an advanced touch screen interface to control the system and view the information produced by the air vehicle’s onboard sensors. Highly portable and easy to assemble, operate and stow, Snipe is designed to provide rapid airborne information within one kilometer of its launch point in situations where time is short and risk is high.
     Our line of miniature gimbaled sensor payloads provides small UAS operators with enhanced observation and target tracking functionality. Our DDL is integrated into Puma AE, Raven and Wasp AE and Snipe systems, enhancing their capabilities, and ultimately, the utility of our small UAS by enabling more efficient radio spectrum utilization and communications security. Small UAS incorporating our DDL offer many more channels as compared to our analog link, increasing the number of air vehicles that can operate in a given area. Additionally, our DDL enables each air vehicle to operate as an Internet‑Protocol addressable hub capable of routing and relaying video, voice and data to and from multiple other nodes on this ad hoc network. This capability enables beyond line‑of‑sight operation of our small UAS, further enhancing their value proposition to our customers.
    
Tactical Missile Systems Products
     Our tactical missile systems consist of tube-launched aircraft that deploy with the push of a button, fly at higher speeds than our small UAS, and perform either effects delivery or reconnaissance missions.  Switchblade, the first of our tactical missile systems products, can be transported in its launch tube, within a backpack, and deployed within minutes to defend against lethal threats such as snipers and mortar teams.  With a high level of precision, including a custom warhead, wave-off, loiter and re-engagement capabilities, Switchblade can neutralize a target rapidly and accurately without causing collateral damage. Furthermore, because it streams live electro-optical and thermal video to its operator, Switchblade can be called off in the final moments prior to a strike should the situation require, minimizing damage to non-combatants.  Blackwing, a variant of Switchblade, launches from a submerged submarine and carries extra batteries instead of a warhead, providing longer flight time for reconnaissance operations.

--+-------------------------------------

      Three of our UAS and tactical missile systems development initiatives are described below:
     Tactical Missile System Variants. We pioneered our first rapidly deployable, high‑precision tactical missile system, named Switchblade, for use by defense ground forces. Switchblade is now deployed by the U.S. military to provide force protection to its troops overseas in combat operations.

During a multitude of demonstrations over the course of several years, multiple potential customers requested modifications to Switchblade to accommodate their specific mission requirements. We performed a number of successful demonstrations and are now developing several variants to Switchblade for new customers and applications, including deployment from sea and air vehicles. Blackwing, a submarine-launched reconnaissance system, represents one of the variants. Other variants have transitioned into production and sale to U.S. customers. We believe these new variants have the potential to expand our tactical missile systems opportunities significantly.
     Commercial Unmanned Aircraft Systems‑Based Information Solutions. In the same way our small UAS provide situational awareness to military customers, we can employ our small UAS with advanced sensors to scan vast or inaccessible infrastructure, plants or wildlife, then process and analyze the resulting data to produce actionable information for a wide variety of companies in industries that include energy, agriculture and natural resource management. Our Quantix data collection drone is designed for highly automated vegetation and topographical scanning of more than 400 acres in its 45 minute flight time.  Equipped with fixed electro-optical and multi-spectral sensors, Quantix takes off vertically, transitions to horizontal operation, flies its designated mission, then lands itself vertically at its launch point.  Lower resolution data can be viewed immediately through the wireless transmission of image data from the Quantix to its commercial tablet controller pre-loaded with custom software.  Further automated analysis can be performed by uploading the data to the AVDSS, a cloud-based platform for processing, analyzing and storing collected data. We have developed this capability based on extensive work with early adopters for anticipated adoption in what could be a large market.
     High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites, or HAPS.  Building on our decades of groundbreaking development and demonstration of high altitude solar-powered UAS, in 2018 we established a joint venture with SoftBank Corp. to create a global broadband and telecommunications company to demonstrate and deploy HAPS UAS around the world.  HAPSMobile, Inc. is five percent owned by AeroVironment, Inc. and 95 percent owned by SoftBank Corp. The joint venture is providing $76 million in funding to AeroVironment to develop and demonstrate solar HAPS UAS.  AeroVironment possesses exclusive rights to manufacture and supply the solar HAPS UAS developed by the joint venture to HAPSMobile, Inc., subject to meeting contractual performance criteria.  HAPSMobile, Inc. possesses exclusive rights to the solar HAPS UAS for commercial markets globally, while AeroVironment possesses exclusive rights to the solar HAPS UAS for non-commercial markets globally, with the exception of Japan.
     UAS Sales and Marketing
     We organize our U.S. UAS business development team members by target market and customer and we locate team members in close proximity to the customers they support, where possible. We organize our program managers by product and focus on designing optimal solutions and contract fulfillment, as well as internalizing feedback from customers and users. By maintaining assigned points of contact with our customers, we believe that we are able to maintain our relationships, service existing contracts effectively and gain vital feedback to improve our responsiveness and product offerings. We employ a direct-sale and dealer-based distribution strategy for our Commercial Information Solutions.
     UAS Manufacturing and Operations
     Continued investment in infrastructure has established our manufacturing capability to meet demand with scalable capacity. We have the manufacturing infrastructure to produce UAS products at rates higher than our historical volumes, support initial low rate production for new UAS development programs and tactical missile systems and execute initial low‑rate production of large UAS. By drawing upon experienced personnel across various manufacturing industries including aerospace, automotive and volume commodities, we have instituted lean production systems and leverage our International Organization for Standardization, or ISO certification for Quality Management, integrated supply chain strategy, document control systems and process control methodologies for production. Presently, we 

 
  13

 
perform small UAS manufacturing at the 85,000 square foot manufacturing facility we established in 2005. Our 9001:2015 + AS9100D certified manufacturing facilities are designed to accommodate demand of up to 1,000 aircraft per month. ISO 9001:2015 + AS9100D refers to a set of voluntary standards for quality management systems. These standards are established by the ISO to govern quality management systems used worldwide. Companies that receive ISO certification have passed audits performed by a Registrar Accreditation Board‑certified auditing company. These audits evaluate the effectiveness of companies’ quality management systems and their compliance with ISO standards. Some companies and government agencies view ISO certification as a positive factor in supplier assessments.
     UAS Competition
     The market for defense small UAS continues to evolve in response to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the potential introduction of new products. We believe that a number of established domestic and international defense contractors have developed or are developing small UAS that continue to compete, or will compete, directly with our products. Some of these contractors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we possess. Our current principal small UAS competitors include Elbit Systems Ltd., L3 Technologies, Inc., and Lockheed Martin Corporation. We do not view large UAS such as Northrop Grumman Corporation’s Global Hawk, General Atomics, Inc.’s Predator and its derivatives, The Boeing Company’s ScanEagle and Textron Inc.’s Shadow as direct competitors to our small UAS because they perform different missions, do not typically deliver their information directly to front‑line ground forces and are not hand‑launched and controlled. However, we cannot be certain that these platforms will not become direct competitors in the future. Potential competition from consumer-focused drone manufacturers could emerge as their capabilities increase and their prices remain low relative to existing defense solutions, which could result in some level of military consideration even if such drones do not meet traditional military performance or security specifications.
     The market for HAPS UAS is in an early stage of development. As a result, this category is not well defined and is characterized by multiple potential solutions. An existing contractor that claims to provide high altitude long endurance UAS is Northrop Grumman Corporation with its Global Hawk. Several aerospace and defense contractors are pursuing this market opportunity with proposed very long duration UAS, including The Boeing Company, Airbus, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. Some internet technology companies have acquired small firms that focus on this type of capability and represent potential future competitors. Companies pursuing airships (high altitude aircraft that are kept buoyant by a body of gas that is lighter than air) as a solution for this market include Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation. Companies pursuing conventional satellites as a solution for this market include The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation, EADS N.V., Ball Corporation and Orbital Sciences Corporation. Companies pursuing Low Earth Orbit, or LEO, micro or cubesat satellite constellations for global communication and remote sensing include OneWeb, SpaceX and The Boeing Company.
     The market for tactical missile systems is in an early stage of development, but it is evolving rapidly. Competitors in this market include Textron Inc., Raytheon Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation.
     The market for commercial UAS products and services is in an early stage of development, but is evolving rapidly, generating a great deal of interest as government regulations evolve to accommodate commercial UAS operations in the National Airspace System and in the airspace systems of other countries. Given the breadth of applications and the diversity of industries that could benefit from UAS technology, a growing number of potential competitors in this market include consumer drone manufacturers such as Dà-Jiāng Innovation, who seek to enhance their systems’ capabilities over time; other small UAS manufacturers, including large aerospace companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, and drone and aerial surveying and mapping service providers such as PrecisionHawk and AgEagle; ground‑based surveying and mapping service providers; satellite imagery providers; and specialty system manufacturers, software as a service and other service providers aiming to address specific market segments. The emerging non‑military market is attracting numerous additional competitors and significant venture capital funding given perceived lower barriers to entry and a much more fragmented marketplace as compared to the military market. Potential additional competitors include start‑up companies providing low cost solutions.
    
 
  14

 

 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for our UAS products and services include product performance, features, acquisition cost, lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment and processes, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.
     UAS Regulation
     Due to the fact that we contract with the DoD and other agencies of the U.S. government, we are subject to extensive federal regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisitions Regulations, Truth in Negotiations Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, False Claims Act and the regulations promulgated under the DoD Industrial Security Manual, which establishes the security guidelines for classified programs and facilities as well as individual security clearances. The federal government audits and reviews our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Like most government contractors, our contracts are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by federal agencies, including the Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA.
     Certain of these regulations impose substantial penalties for violations, including suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. We monitor all of our contracts and contractual efforts to minimize the possibility of any violation of these regulations.
     In addition, we are subject to industry‑specific regulations due to the nature of the products and services we provide. For example, certain aspects of our business are subject to further regulation by additional U.S. government authorities, including (i) the FAA, which regulates airspace for all air vehicles in the U.S. National Airspace System, (ii) the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate the wireless communications upon which our UAS depend in the United States and (iii) the Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department of State that administers the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which regulate the export of controlled technical data, defense articles and defense services.
     The FAA issued the first restricted type certificate for the commercial operation of an unmanned aircraft over American soil to our Puma AE system in 2014. Under a COA, we operated Puma AE systems in the Prudhoe Bay area of Alaska to support a major oil and gas customer. The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to determine whether an airworthiness certificate is required for a UAS to operate safely in the U.S. National Airspace System. On September 25, 2014 the FAA began issuing case‑by‑case authorization for certain unmanned aircraft to perform commercial operations prior to the finalization of the rules providing for the integration of small UAS into the U.S. National Airspace System. As of May 11, 2015 the FAA had granted us four exemptions for the use of our small UAS, including Puma AE systems, for agriculture, aerial survey, and patrol operations and for inspections of fixed infrastructures in controlled environments. On June 21, 2016 the FAA released its final rules that allow routine use of certain small UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System. The FAA rules, which went into effect in August 2016, provide safety rules for small UAS (under 55 pounds) conducting non‑recreational operations. The rules limit flights to visual‑line‑of‑sight daylight operation, unless the UAS has anti-collision lights in which case twilight operation is permitted. The final rule also addresses height and speed restrictions, operator certification, optional use of a visual observer, aircraft registration and marking and operational limits, including prohibiting flights over unprotected people on the ground who are not directly participating in the operation of the UAS. Current FAA regulations require drone operators to register their systems with the FAA and secure operating licenses for their drones as per the Part 107 specifications.  These regulations continue to evolve to accommodate the integration of UAS into the national airspace system for commercial applications, including HAPS UAS, that are designed to fly at very high altitudes for extended periods of time.
     Furthermore, our non‑U.S. operations are subject to the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, which may include regulations that are more stringent than those imposed by the U.S. government on our U.S. operations.

 UAS Government Contracting Process
     We sell the significant majority of our small UAS and tactical missile system products and services as the prime contractor under contracts with the U.S. government. Certain important aspects of our government contracts are described below.     UAS Bidding Process
     Most of our current government contracts were awarded through a competitive bidding process. The U.S. government awards competitive‑bid contracts based on proposal evaluation criteria established by the procuring agency. Competitive‑bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among providers. Interested contractors prepare a bid and proposal in response to the agency’s request for proposal or request for information. A bid and proposal is usually prepared in a short time period in response to a deadline and requires the extensive involvement of numerous technical and administrative personnel. Following award, competitive‑bid contracts may be challenged by unsuccessful bidders.
     UAS Funding
     The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Although multi‑year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis, even though a program may continue for many years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations.
     The U.S. military funds its contracts for our full‑rate production UAS either through operational need statements or as programs of record. Operational need statements require allocations of discretionary spending or reallocations of funding from other government programs. Funding for our production of initial Raven system deliveries, for example, was provided through operational need statements. We define a program of record as a program which, after undergoing extensive DoD review and product testing, is included in the five‑year government budget cycle, meaning that funding is allocated for purchases under these contracts during the five‑year cycle, absent affirmative action by the customer or Congress to change the budgeted amount. Despite being included in the five-year budget cycle, funding for these programs is subject to annual approval.
     UAS Material Government Contract Provisions
     All contracts with the U.S. government contain provisions, and are subject to laws and regulations, that give the government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including rights that allow the government to:
· | terminate existing contracts for convenience, in whole or in part, when it is in the interest of the government to do so;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | terminate contracts for default upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | unilaterally modify contracts with regard to certain performance requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cancel multi‑year contracts and related orders, if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potentially obtain rights in, or ownership to, intellectual property associated with products and systems developed or delivered by a contractor as a result of its performance of the contract;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adjust contract costs and fees on the basis of audits completed by its agencies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | suspend or debar a contractor from doing business with the U.S. government; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  16

 

    
· | control or prohibit the export of certain items.
--+-------------------------------------------------

      Generally, government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives. Compensation, if any, in the event of a termination for default is limited to payment for work completed at the time of termination. In the event of a termination for convenience, the contractor may receive the contract price for completed work, as well as its costs of performance of terminated work including an allowance for profit and reasonable termination settlement costs.
     UAS Government Contract Categories
     We have three types of government contracts, each of which involves a different payment methodology and level of risk related to the cost of performance. These basic types of contracts are typically referred to as fixed‑price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, including cost‑plus‑fixed fee, cost‑plus‑award fee, and cost‑plus‑incentive fee, and time‑and‑materials contracts.
     In some cases, depending on the urgency of the project and the complexity of the contract negotiation, we will enter into a Letter Contract prior to finalizing the terms of a definitive fixed‑price, cost reimbursable or time‑and‑materials definitive contract. A Letter Contract is a written preliminary contractual instrument that provides limited initial funding and authorizes us to begin immediately manufacturing supplies or performing services while negotiating the definitive terms of the procurement.
     Fixed‑Price. These contracts are not subject to adjustment by reason of costs incurred in the performance of the contract. With this type of contract, we assume the risk that we will not be able to perform at a cost below the fixed‑price, except for costs incurred because of contract changes ordered by the customer. Upon the U.S. government’s termination of a fixed‑price contract, generally we would be entitled to payment for items delivered to and accepted by the U.S. government and, if the termination is at the U.S. government’s convenience, for payment of fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by any terminated subcontractors, other settlement expenses and a reasonable allowance for profit on the costs incurred.
     Cost Reimbursable. Cost reimbursable contracts include cost‑plus‑fixed fee contracts, cost‑plus‑award fee contracts and cost‑plus‑incentive fee contracts, each of which are described below. Under each type of contract, we assume the risk that we may not be able to recover costs if they are not allowable under the contract terms or applicable regulations, or if the costs exceed the contract funding.
    
· | Cost‑plus‑fixed fee contracts are cost reimbursable contracts that provide for payment of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract. This fixed fee does not vary with actual cost of the contract, but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract. This contract type poses less risk of loss than a fixed‑price contract, but our ability to win future contracts from the procuring agency may be adversely affected if we fail to perform within the maximum cost set forth in the contract.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A cost‑plus‑award fee contract is a cost reimbursable contract that provides for a fee consisting of a base amount, which may be zero, fixed at inception of the contract and an award amount, based upon the government’s satisfaction with the performance under the contract. With this type of contract, we assume the risk that we may not receive the award fee, or only a portion of it, if we do not perform satisfactorily.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A cost‑plus‑incentive fee contract is a cost reimbursable contract that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     We typically experience lower profit margins and lower risk under cost reimbursable contracts than under fixed‑price contracts. Upon the termination of a cost reimbursable contract, generally we would be entitled to reimbursement of our allowable costs and, if the termination is at the U.S. government’s convenience, a total fee proportionate to the percentage of work completed under the contract.
     Time‑and‑Materials. Under a time‑and‑materials contract, our compensation is based on a fixed hourly rate established for specified labor or skill categories. We are paid at the established hourly rates for the hours we expend performing the work specified in the contract. Labor costs, overhead, general and administrative costs and profit are included in the fixed hourly rate. Materials, subcontractors, travel and other direct costs are reimbursed at actual costs plus an amount for material handling. We make critical pricing assumptions and decisions when developing and proposing time‑and‑materials labor rates. We risk reduced profitability if our actual costs exceed the costs incorporated into the fixed hourly labor rate. One variation of a standard time‑and‑materials contract is a time‑and‑materials, award fee contract. Under this type of contract, a positive or negative incentive can be earned based on achievement against specific performance metrics.
     UAS Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract Form
     The U.S. government frequently uses IDIQ contracts and IDIQ‑type contract forms, such as cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts with multiple one‑year options, to obtain fixed‑price, cost reimbursable and time‑and‑materials contractual commitments to provide products or services over a period of time pursuant to established general terms and conditions. At the time of the award of an IDIQ contract or IDIQ‑type contract, the U.S. government generally commits to purchase only a minimal amount of products or services from the contractor to whom such contract is awarded.
     After award of an IDIQ contract the U.S. government may issue task orders for specific services or products it needs. The competitive process to obtain task orders under an award contract is limited to the pre‑selected contractors. If an IDIQ contract has a single prime contractor, then the award of task orders is limited to that contractor. If the contract has multiple prime contractors, then the award of the task order is competitively determined among only those prime contractors.
     IDIQ and IDIQ‑type contracts typically have multi‑year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts that enable, but do not commit, the U.S. government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors.
