 The following discussion of Digimarc’s business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of Digimarc. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Please see the discussion regarding forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.”
 The following discussion of our business should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Overview
 Digimarc Corporation is a pioneer of digital watermarking solutions, which enable a more efficient, reliable and economical means of automatic identification. Our technology can be used to apply a unique digital identity to virtually all media objects, including product packaging, commercial print, audio and video. These digital identities can be automatically identified by an enabled ecosystem of industrial scanners, smartphones and other interfaces. The technology features:

• | Digimarc watermarks: a data carrier that can provide a unique digital identity to media objects and is generally visibly imperceptible to people and therefore can be repeated many times over the surface of media objects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digimarc Discover: a software program for computing devices and network interfaces that recognizes and decodes digital identities applied to media objects. These digital identities can be applied to media objects using Digimarc watermarks, quick response codes and universal product codes, among other types of codes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digimarc Verify: a suite of software tools used to inspect and verify that the digital identity applied via Digimarc watermarks to media objects is accurate and effective.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Together, these core capabilities enable organizations, application developers, and other solution providers to build new and improve existing automatic identification solutions.
 Digimarc’s technologies enable customers to create digital identities for physical and digital media objects and provide many benefits for these objects, including:
  
• | Product Authentication & Anti-Counterfeiting: The Digimarc watermark can contain unique information to help protect products from counterfeiting and empower suppliers, retailers, authorities or consumers to use mobile devices to analyze packaging that may appear authentic and confirm the legitimacy of products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recycling Accuracy: The digital identity can contain information specific to packaging content as an aid to broader and more efficient recycling. For example, a microscopic pattern embossed in plastic packaging can identify the materials used and their composition to aid sorting and recapture.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain Traceability: The digital identity can carry serial numbers for easier tracking of individual items or entire lots. This provides brands more visibility into their supply chains to track their physical products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Online Piracy Protection: The digital identity provides a unique identifier, whether in a digital image, video or audio file, for the detection of use or distribution of the related digital media object.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Document Security: The digital identity enables fraud deterrence, most notably in deterring the counterfeiting of banknotes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail Operations: The digital identity can be applied to product packaging, allowing for faster and more accurate inventory scanning and faster and easier front-of-store checkout.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our technologies provide a powerful security element (the ability to apply a unique code in any media object), which gave rise to our long-term relationship with a consortium of central banks (the “Central Banks”). That relationship, centered on the counterfeit deterrence of banknotes, was the first commercially successful large-scale use of our technologies.
 In March 2021, Digimarc and Multi-Color Corporation (“MCC”), a global leader in label solutions, announced a partnership to serialize product packaging and labels with Digimarc watermarks in support of food safety and traceability initiatives. MCC and its client Orkla, a leading supplier of branded consumer goods in Europe and India, are working together to improve the sortation of plastic and promote a circular economy.
 In April 2021, Digimarc entered into an agreement with Practical Methods, Inc. (“Practical Methods”) to license its edgecode™ offering, which provides serialized Digimarc watermarks on packaging for anti-counterfeiting, supply chain visibility and consumer engagement initiatives. Practical Methods specializes in segments within the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, healthcare, consumer packaged goods, sports, apparel and food industries.
 In May 2021, Digimarc announced that Esko, a leading prepress software developer and hardware manufacturer, had integrated Digimarc watermark detection and data validation into its industry leading AVT Print Inspection Solutions. The integration simplifies the inspection process and gives consumer goods manufacturers and their packaging suppliers a seamless way to ensure quality control of packaging enabled with Digimarc watermarks through the printing process.
 In September 2021, Digimarc announced it had entered phase 2 semi-industrial trials, the next stage of development for intelligent waste sorting as part of the Digital Watermarks Initiative HolyGrail 2.0, driven by AIM, the European Brands Association, and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. As the selected digital watermarks technology provider, Digimarc is working with the initiative’s two sortation equipment manufacturers, Pellenc ST and Tomra, which together represent an estimated 80% of global market share, to develop add-on modules for their detection sorting units. This milestone marks the second year of the HolyGrail 2.0 project, which has grown to include over 160 companies and organizations across the complete packaging value chain.
 In November 2021, Digimarc announced its plan to acquire the product cloud company EVRYTHNG Limited (“EVRYTHNG”) to support greater product digitalization and intelligence. Combining Digimarc’s unique means of identification with the EVRYTHNG Product Cloud® platform makes it possible to gather and apply traceability data from across the product lifecycle, providing end-to-end visibility and authenticity through item-level, real-time intelligence and analytics.
 On January 3, 2022, Digimarc acquired all of EVRYTHNG’s outstanding share capital and EVRYTHNG became a wholly owned subsidiary of Digimarc. EVRYTHNG’s market-leading Product Cloud offering opens new markets for Digimarc, further expanding our ability to sell robust, fully integrated solutions that no one else now offers, and provides future cross-selling opportunities into our dual platforms. The acquisition adds 65 employees and expands the geographic footprint for the company, including EVRYTHNG’s main office in London, England.
 Integrated Environmental, Social and Governance Strategy
 Digimarc is committed to becoming a leader in the Environmental, Social and Governance space (“ESG”). ESG is an integral element of Digimarc's strategy, covering the three key areas of our organization’s impacts on the world around us (impacts on the economy, environment and people), as well as environmental, social, and governance risks or opportunities that have an impact on Digimarc (enterprise value creation). This supports our ability to create value sustainably.
 We proactively manage our ESG impacts across People, Product, and Planet, the three pillars of Digimarc’s ESG Framework. In addition, our responsible management of Governance topics forms the foundation for this Framework.

In 2021, Digimarc started investing in ESG as an integrated element of its strategy and operations. We added a Vice President, ESG Engagement & Corporate Communications position to our executive management team. The newly formed ESG & Corporate Communications team began building on our history of commitment to sustainability and social responsibility by conducting a structured ESG materiality assessment. This assessment identified Digimarc’s material ESG impacts, based on a stakeholder mapping and the globally recognized standards published by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”).
 Some of the most prominent ESG impacts we identified are the following:
 
 
People | Product | Planet 
Human Capital Management, including employee engagement and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”). | Product design for sustainability applications, such as Digimarc watermarks’ ability to improve the accuracy of plastics sortation for recycling. | Climate change management, including our carbon footprint and our strategic response to climate risks and opportunities.

 Management of material ESG impacts across People, Product, and Planet is integrated throughout our organization. Accountability and responsibility for impacts lies with functional leads and relevant subject-matter experts, who act as Impact Owners and Impact Managers, respectively. This approach allows effective incorporation of ESG considerations into our strategic decisions, policies, and processes. The ESG & Corporate Communications team plays a coordinating role, supporting Impact Owners and Impact Managers and reporting on progress to stakeholders.
 In 2022, Digimarc’s Impact Owners, Impact Managers, and the ESG & Corporate Communications team will work together to set concrete goals for our impact across People, Product, and Planet. Furthermore, Digimarc plans to publish its inaugural annual ESG Impact Report in the first half of 2022, communicating our progress over 2021 and our goals to all stakeholders. The report will align with industry standards, such as those published by SASB.

 Customers and Business Partners
 We generate revenue through commercial and government applications of our technology. We service two primary markets: Government and Commercial. Government includes the Central Banks and other government customers. Commercial includes retailers, brands, their suppliers and related solution providers, as well as media, entertainment, education, and other customers. 
 We derive our revenue primarily from software development services, subscriptions for products and related professional services, and licensing or sale of our patents. During 2021, we generated the majority of our revenue from software development services under a long-term contract with the Central Banks, with whom we have been developing, deploying, supporting and enhancing a system to deter digital counterfeiting of currency using personal computers and digital reprographics for over 20 years, and from subscriptions for our products.
 In 2021, revenue from government contracts accounted for 54% of our total revenue. The Central Banks accounted for a majority of all revenue generated under our government contracts. Our contract with the Central Banks runs through December 2024, with a 5-year extension option.
 Technology and Intellectual Property
 We seek patent protection for our inventions to differentiate our products and technologies, mitigate infringement risks, and develop opportunities for licensing. Our broad patent portfolio covers a wide range of methods, applications, system architectures and processes.
 Our intellectual property contains many innovations in digital watermarking, content and object recognition, digital rights management and related fields. To protect our inventions, we have implemented an extensive intellectual property protection program that relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and nondisclosure agreements and other contracts. As a result, we believe we have one of the world’s most 
 3


extensive patent portfolios in digital watermarking and related fields, with approximately 1,000 U.S. and foreign patents granted and applications pending as of December 31, 2021. The patents in our portfolio each have a life of approximately 20 years from the patent’s effective filing date.
 Our current patent licensees include, among others, AlpVision SA, Intellectual Ventures, Kantar SAS, NexGuard Labs B.V., Nielsen, OverDrive, Inc., Signum Technologies, Teletrax B.V., U-NICA Systems AG and Verance Corporation.
 For a discussion of activities and costs related to our research and development in the last two years, see “Research, development and engineering” under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Markets
 Our patented technologies are used in various automatic identification products and solutions supporting a variety of media objects, from consumer package goods to movies and music, digital images, and banknotes. Each media object enabled by our technology creates the potential for several applications, such as:

• | product authentication of physical products;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | sorting of consumer packaged goods in recycling streams;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | track and trace of products within the supply chain;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | quality control in manufacturing processes;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | inventory management and planogram compliance;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | retail point of sale transaction processing;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | piracy deterrence of digital media objects;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | content identification and media management; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | enhanced services in support of mobile commerce.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 We believe that existing products and solutions represent only a small portion of the potential market for our technology.
 Competition
 No single competitor or small number of competitors dominate our market. Our competitors vary depending on the application of our products and services. We generally compete with non-digital watermarking technologies for the security or marketing budgets of the producers and distributors of media objects, documents, products and advertising. These alternatives include, among other things, encryption-based security systems and technologies and solutions based on fingerprinting, pattern recognition, and traditional barcodes. Our competitive position in digital watermarking applications is strong because of our large, high-quality, sophisticated patent portfolio and our substantial and growing amount of intellectual property in related innovations for the automatic identification of media objects that span basic technologies, applications, system designs and business processes. Our intellectual property portfolio allows us to use proprietary technologies that are well-regarded by our customers and partners, and not available to our competitors without a license. We compete based on the variety of features we offer and a traditional cost/benefit analysis against alternative technologies and solutions. We anticipate that our competitive position within some markets may be affected by factors such as reluctance to adopt new technologies and by changes in government regulations.
Backlog
 Based on projected commitments we have for the periods under contract with our respective customers, we anticipate our current contracts as of December 31, 2021, will generate a minimum of $29 million in revenue, compared to $31 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease is largely related to the structure of our contract with the Central Banks. We expect approximately $16 million of the $29 million to be recognized as revenue during 2022.

Some factors that lead to increased backlog include:
  
• | contracts with new customers;
--+------------------------------


• | renewals with current customers;
--+---------------------------------


• | add-on orders with customers; and
--+----------------------------------


• | contracts with longer contractual periods replacing contracts with shorter contractual periods.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some factors that lead to decreased backlog include:
  
• | recognition of revenue associated with existing backlog;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | contracts with shorter contractual periods replacing contracts with longer contractual periods;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | modifications to existing contracts;
--+-------------------------------------


• | contract minimum payments ending; and
--+--------------------------------------


• | expiration of contracts with existing customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 The mix of these factors, among others, dictates whether our backlog increases or decreases for any given period. Our backlog may not result in actual revenue in any particular period, because the orders, awards and contracts included in our backlog may be subject to modification, cancellation or suspension. We may not realize revenue on certain contracts, orders or awards included in our backlog, or the timing of any realization may change.
 Human Capital Resources and Management
 Employees and Labor Relations
 At December 31, 2021, we had 228 full-time employees, including 78 in sales, marketing, product, operations and customer support; 98 in research, development and engineering; and 52 in finance, administration, information technology, intellectual property and legal.
 Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. Voluntary employee turnover was 9% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in voluntary employee turnover was largely driven by a more competitive labor market.
 Values
 Culture is critically important to Digimarc’s success. We incorporate our core values in daily interactions with colleagues, customers, vendors and other stakeholders. Our core values are embodied in the words Collaborative, Curious and Courageous.

Digimarc Values
 | Collaborative | Curious | Courageous 
We: | Ask for help Prioritize mentoring Build trust and transparency | Support innovative thinking Continuously seek clarity Listen to our stakeholders | Challenge our own biases Cultivate collective experiences Seek out and support ideas
We Do Not: | Avoid difficult conversations | Lose sight of our purpose | Assume we have all the answers 

 We continue to aid and support our employees during the coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic with our work-from-home initiative for the majority of our staff. Essential on-site staff benefited from enhanced safety procedures, and the number of employees on-site at any given time was regulated. We provided assistance to help employees who work from home to improve their workspaces, and we increased flexibility in our paid leave programs to support employees caring for children and others. An increasing number of our employees work remotely full-time.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We strive to create an environment where innovative ideas can flourish by demonstrating respect for each other and valuing the diverse opinions, backgrounds and viewpoints of our employees. As a company committed to innovation and representing diversity in a myriad of ways, including race, ethnicity, nationality, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religious beliefs, background, perspectives, tenure, and work style, we believe that diversity is a competitive asset. We believe that diversity in our teams leads to new ideas, helps us solve problems and allows us to better connect with our global customer base.
 We have taken specific actions to continue to foster DEI in our culture, including transparency that we believe will lead to greater inclusion and innovation, with the adoption of the Table Group Methodology, all-employee meetings and fireside chats with our Chief Executive Officer. Learning resources have been implemented to support the acquisition of the skills and behaviors expected from our employees.
 In 2021, we identified DEI specifically, and human capital management more broadly, as one of our most material ESG impacts under the People pillar of our ESG Framework. To further structure our approach to DEI, we assigned accountability and responsibility for this topic at various levels of our Human Resources organization, in line with our integrated ESG approach. Our Board of Directors also plays an important role in our DEI efforts. The Governance, Nominating, and Sustainability Committee oversees the Company’s human capital management and DEI programs, in coordination with the Audit and Compensation Committees.
 Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe that these principles are strongly aligned with the strategic priorities of our business and our objective to deliver value for our shareholders. We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization. We conduct pay equity assessments and compensation reviews periodically, and when necessary, we take action to address areas of concern. Our total compensation package includes market-competitive pay, stock grants, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, family leave, sick leave and flexible work schedules.
 We continue to support our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including focused outreach and support through our community outreach matching program, which matches donations made by our employees to their charities of choice.
 Learning and Development
 We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation. We have a performance management system to support continuous learning and development. Through frequent surveys and anonymous feedback fora, employees can voice their perceptions of the Company and their work experience, including learning and development opportunities. We have strong participation in our surveys and engage our managers to respond to areas that employees have identified as needing improvement or given low scores.
 We support training and development programs for our employees through tuition reimbursement, online training programs such as LinkedIn Learning, conferences, seminars, on-the-job training, and skill certifications. We also encourage and foster onsite training programs and mentoring. 
 Health, Safety and Wellness
 We are committed to a safe and drug-free workplace. We continually invest in programs designed to improve physical, mental, and social well-being. We provide access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, which were increasingly critical this year for our essential workers who have worked on-site since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has remained protecting the health and safety of our employees while preserving business continuity.
 Governance and Oversight
 The executive management team is entrusted with developing and advancing our key human capital strategy, which is reviewed with the Board of Directors. The Chief People Officer is charged with developing and stewarding this strategy on a company-wide basis. This incorporates a broad range of dimensions, including culture, values, labor and employee relations, leadership capabilities, performance management and compensation. DEI are key to successfully achieving business and organizational objectives. Key processes include ongoing performance and development feedback, diversity, equity and inclusion reviews, and periodic engagement surveys that are reviewed 
 6


by management and the Board of Directors. All employees have access to resources on topics regarding integrity, our code of conduct, diversity, compliance, and workplace harassment. Employees are encouraged to address any concerns through multiple channels, including anonymously whenever possible, without fear of retaliation or retribution.
