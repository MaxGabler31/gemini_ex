ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a non-lethal defense technology company, specializing in innovative, next generation solutions for security situations that do not require the use of lethal force. Our mantra is Live Safe®, and our core mission is to empower people to safely embrace life. We seek to fulfill our mission by developing easy-to-use self-defense tools that are designed to allow people to live more safely. We are also focused on providing law enforcement and private security customers with non-lethal alternatives to firearms that are intended to reduce the use of firearms and facilitate trust within the communities they serve.
 
Our product portfolio includes:
 

● | handheld personal security devices and shoulder-fired launchers designed for use by consumers and professional security customers without the need for a background check or firearms license;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a line of projectiles that are fired by Byrna devices, including chemical irritant, kinetic and inert rounds; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | accessories and related safety products, including the Byrna Banshee™, Byrna Shield™, compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) canisters, sighting systems, holsters and Byrna-branded apparel.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Byrna personal security devices are powerful and effective non-lethal self-defense devices that are powered by CO2 and fire .68 caliber spherical kinetic and chemical irritant projectiles that are designed to disable a threat from a standoff distance of up to 60 feet. We have designed our Byrna devices to function as a platform that can be enhanced, upgraded and customized in a modular fashion with our accessory products. Only Byrna projectiles are approved for use with Byrna launchers, which creates the potential for reoccurring sales of consumable products. We also offer our Blunt Impact Projectile line of non-lethal munitions for 40-millimeter rifled launchers utilized by law enforcement, correctional services and military customers.
 
Our products are sold in both the consumer and security professional markets. In the consumer market, our solutions are designed to provide ordinary civilians with an effective, non-lethal tool to disable, disarm and deter would-be assailants and to escape harm’s way. In the professional market, our products are designed to provide domestic and international law enforcement agencies, corrections and custodial officers, private security professionals, private investigators and other professional security users with a practical, non-lethal option to address threats and resolve conflicts without the need to resort to lethal force. Our products can be purchased in most U.S. locations quickly, simply and discreetly, without the requirement for a license, background check or waiting period.
 
Strategic Focus and Products
 
Our strategy is to establish Byrna as a consumer lifestyle brand associated with the confidence people can achieve by knowing they can protect themselves, their loved ones and those around them. We believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage the Byrna brand to expand our product line, broaden our user base and generate increasing sales from new and existing customers.
 
Our flagship product, the Byrna HD, has been updated and improved with the introduction of the Byrna SD in the second half of fiscal year 2021. It is a compact, ergonomically designed, handheld personal security device with the size and form factor of a compact handgun. It is easy to use, has virtually no recoil and is designed to fire accurately with an effective range of 60 feet. The Byrna SD utilizes our patented technology and more than 60 custom designed parts. The Byrna SD comes with multiple easily reloadable magazines that can hold five .68 caliber projectiles (with plans to increase this capacity to seven projectiles). The Byrna SD is designed to provide a non-lethal alternative to a firearm, effective at a much safer stand-off distance than pepper spray or conductive energy devices, which have recommended maximum ranges of 10 feet and 20 feet, respectively. We also recently released the Byrna SD XL, featuring a longer barrel, greater muzzle velocity and compatibility with a standard 12-gram CO2 cartridge.
 
In May 2021, we purchased certain assets of Mission Less Lethal, a U.S. manufacturer of .68 caliber, non-lethal, shoulder-fired launchers for law enforcement and other security professionals. By leveraging the technology and intellectual property acquired from Mission Less Lethal, we plan to introduce the Byrna TCR, an easy to use, tactical compact rifle that can fire 19 rounds in rapid succession at more than 325 feet per second using a standard 12-gram CO2 cartridge for propulsion, and we have recently released the Byrna M-4, a full sized tactical rifle with either 120 round capacity in law enforcement form or two 20 round magazines in civilian form. These rifles are well suited to meet specific situational needs of security professionals, including law enforcement, private security and corrections customers.
 
We offer a range of .68 caliber projectiles for different applications. Our chemical irritant projectiles include Byrna Max, which contains a pepper and tear gas blend, and Byrna Pepper, which contains a pepper and PAVA blend. These chemical irritant projectiles are designed to intensely burn an assailant’s eyes and skin and impair their respiratory system upon contact, with quick-acting, incapacitating effects. We also offer Byrna Kinetic, a lower-cost, hard plastic projectile that can be used for self-defense or training, and Byrna Pro Training, a projectile filled with inert powder to simulate use of chemical irritant rounds for training. We recently introduced the Eco-Kinetic line of projectiles which are environmentally safe, fully biodegradable and highly accurate rounds for both safety and recreational uses. In addition, we plan to introduce our patented Fin-Stabilized projectiles that are designed to deliver increased speed and accuracy at up to 150 feet of range, while doubling the payload of our .68 caliber rounds. We offer selected projectiles in five-count, 25-count, 95-count, and 400-count packages.

Additionally, we offer the Byrna Shield, a ballistic-rated backpack that can be fitted with multiple armor panels and utilizes a patented deployment system to protect the wearer from both the front and back. We also market a range of accessories that allow our users to customize, carry, load, power and maintain their Byrna launchers. These accessories include laser sights, flashlight attachments, spare magazines, barrel extensions, holsters and CO2 cartridges. Finally, we offer our customers apparel featuring the Byrna brand and emphasizing our Live Safe motto. Together, our projectiles, accessories and apparel provide us with an attractive source of ongoing revenue from our base of Byrna owners.
 
Marketing and Sales 
 
We sell our products into the consumer market through our Byrna e-commerce store and a network of over 1,300 local, regional and national outdoor and sporting goods stores, either directly or through distributors. We also sell our products through an Amazon storefront. In the professional security market, we seek to drive purchases through our Train the Trainer program developed for police and security officers, with a focus on educating the proper use of force and de-escalation methods.
 
Our international sales are fulfilled primarily by select distribution partners that have expertise in their local markets. International sales represented 8.2% of revenue in our fiscal year 2021; however we see the potential to increase our international sales mix as foreign law enforcement customers are showing growing interest in Byrna devices serving as a non-lethal, secondary security device, and the Byrna approach is increasingly seen as a favorable de-escalation solution.
 
Our marketing efforts are focused on creating brand awareness for Byrna by utilizing promotional specials and banner ads and driving traffic to our e-commerce store through the use of digital marketing tools. We also place a heavy emphasis on customer reviews and ratings. As of November 30, 2021, we had over 4,000 verified customer reviews and had received an average satisfaction rating of 4.6 out of 5.0. In early 2020, we implemented a nationwide reseller and distribution network of brick-and-mortar outlets and engaged third-party firms to market our products to dealers in the outdoor and sporting goods sectors.
 
In June 2020, and then again in April 2021, Byrna was highlighted on a popular national news program. These high-profile events led to significant increases in orders on our e-commerce store and further raised our brand recognition nationally. We believe these events demonstrated the positive and rapid impacts that additional visibility of our products and brand can have on our sales. Our current marketing strategy includes engaging key influencers in relevant markets to highlight the benefits of our security solutions to their respective networks of followers, engaging in public dialogues about firearm regulation, school safety and the expansion of police programs and training in the use of non-lethal weapons, and expanding our use of targeted digital marketing tools.
 
Manufacturing, Suppliers and Distribution
 
We operate two manufacturing facilities. In the United States, we opened a 14,000 square foot facility in 2020 located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We utilize our Fort Wayne facility to fulfill domestic demand for our launchers. In order to improve this domestic capacity, we are planning to move our Fort Wayne manufacturing site to a new 30,000 square foot facility in Spring 2022. To satisfy production demand in international markets, we operate a 10,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Pretoria, South Africa. Both facilities utilize a human capital-oriented model with highly-skilled manual assembly of precision components. With our planned Fort Wayne facility changes, we believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet our production needs for at least the next two years, and that additional capacity is available to us on commercially reasonable terms.
 
We rigorously test 100% of our products at our production facilities before shipment to ensure our products meet stringent quality and performance standards. We also conduct long-term testing of our launchers during the development phase. We measure in-field quality by the rate of returns requested by our customers.
 
Our Byrna SD includes 85 distinct parts, including many custom designed parts. We source these components from third-party suppliers in the U.S. and overseas. Historically, our projectiles have been sole-sourced from third-party suppliers in South Africa. However, we established the capability to manufacture projectiles in our own facilities, thereby, improving quality and availability while reducing dependence on third parties.
 
Backlog 
 
As of the end of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021 we had a backlog of approximately $1.3 million worth of orders. We allow orders received that have not yet shipped to be cancelled, therefore, our backlog may not be indicative of future sales. We have reduced delays in fulfillment of Byrna launcher orders from over 10 weeks as of November 30, 2020 to 1 week at the date of filing this Report. However, industry wide shortages of certain materials, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manufacturers of our third-party produced ammunition and accessories, continue to result in back-orders for Byrna ammunition and accessories.

Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop new products at our headquarters, in Andover, Massachusetts. Our design team is comprised of experts in the fields of mechanical design, precision manufacturing and CO2-powered propulsion. We are currently focused on executing the commercial introduction of a series of new launchers, including the Byrna LE and Byrna PE. These new launchers are expected to benefit from our innovations in the areas of greater and more controlled muzzle velocity, improved cold weather performance, more efficient utilization of CO2, improved triggers, higher capacity magazines, improved sighting systems, yet keeping the product compact and ergonomic. We are also investing engineering resources to develop proprietary projectiles both for the consumer and law enforcement markets. Finally, we are devoting development resources to integrate and enhance the recently acquired Mission Less Lethal products line into our portfolio.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy requiring certain of our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements as needed to control access to our proprietary information.
 
We have 44 issued utility patents, 21 issued design patents. We are currently prosecuting 10 utility patents with one newly filed provisional utility patent. We have seven granted Trademarks and a further 29 trademarks which have been filed and are currently being prosecuted. We further obtained one patent and one trademark through the acquisition of Mission Less Lethal in May 2021 and two patents and four trademarks through the acquisition of Ballistipax. In addition, through the acquisition of Mission Less Lethal, we now hold exclusive rights to use all of the intellectual property of Kore Outdoor, Inc. (the previous owner of Mission Less Lethal) for non-lethal applications.
 
Competition
 
Our non-lethal security products compete with manufacturers of:
 

● | conductive energy devices, including Axon Enterprise, Inc., which sells the TASER device;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other handheld CO2-powered launchers of chemical irritant projectiles, including United Tactical Systems, LLC, which sells products under the PepperBall brand; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | remote restraint devices, including Wrap Technologies, Inc.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, manufacturers of traditional firearms may introduce products competitive with ours. Many of our existing and potential competitors benefit from strong brand recognition, broad product lines, well-established distribution, loyal resellers and customers and significant financial resources. We expect to encounter new competitors as the non-lethal security market grows and as we enter new markets both domestically and internationally. We believe our Byrna line of products is competitive in terms of price, quality, appearance, features, performance and reliability, but we must continue to innovate and increase brand awareness in order to stay competitive.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The manufacture, sale, and purchase of weapons, ammunitions, and explosives are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”), and various state and international agencies that regulate the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of ammunition and explosives. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for our products by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of our products. In order to manufacture, sell, import and export our 40mm products and certain components, we are required to obtain and maintain several FFL and FEL licenses and permits. The Byrna SD is a new product and may be subject to future legislation or regulation. Because it uses CO2, rather than gunpowder or other explosives to launch projectiles, the Byrna SD is not currently a “firearm” regulated by the ATF. It is, however, subject to certain state and local regulations related to “pepper spray” or “tear gas” devices. Re-characterization of the Byrna SD as a firearm or other changes to or new interpretations of existing regulations could impact our ability to manufacture or sell the Byrna SD and its projectiles, or limit their market, which could impact our sales and demand for Byrna products. Similarly changes in laws related to the domestic or international use of chemical irritants by civilians or law enforcement could impact both our sales and the size of the reachable market.

We are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation of our products, technology, operations and markets. For example, the development, production, (re-)exportation, importation, and transfer of our products and technology is subject to U.S. and foreign export control, sanctions, customs, import and anti-boycott laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) (collectively, “Trade Control Laws”). If one or more of our products or technology, or the parts and components we buy from others, is or becomes subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) or national security controls or other controls under the EAR, this could significantly impact our operations, for example by severely limiting our ability to sell, (re-)export, or otherwise transfer our products and technology, or to release controlled technology to foreign person employees or others in the United States or abroad. We may not be able to obtain licenses and other authorizations required under the applicable Trade Control Laws. The failure to satisfy the requirements under the Trade Control Laws, including the failure or inability to obtain necessary licenses or qualify for license exceptions, could delay or prevent the development, production, (re-)export, import, and/or in-country transfer of our products and technology, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
 
Failure by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf to comply with the applicable Trade Control Laws could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We transact with suppliers and others who are exposed to similar risks. Violations of the Trade Control Laws or other applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our products, technology, brand, growth efforts, employees, and business.
 
In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for our business. The importation of materials of and components we use in manufacturing our products and export of finished goods are also subject to extensive federal and international laws and regulations. The handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products may also be regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition do not have a material adverse effect on our sales of products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
 
Human Capital
 
As of November 30, 2021, we had approximately 152 employees, including one part-time employee. We believe that our employee relations are good, and that our human capital meets the needs of our business. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced any work stoppage.  Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our key engineering, technical and senior management personnel and our continued ability to attract and retain skilled employees. We have taken proactive steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of our employees. We expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business.
Environmental Compliance
 
Our facilities are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance will have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.
Corporate History 
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on March 1, 2005 under the name Security Devices International Inc. On February 26, 2020, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware changing our name, effective March 4, 2020, to Byrna Technologies Inc. Effective December 19, 2019, we dissolved our wholly-owned subsidiary Security Devices International Canada Corp (“SDICC”). We currently have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Byrna South Africa (Pty) Ltd. (“Byrna South Africa”) and Roboro Industries Pty LTD (“Roboro”). On May 5, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Roboro and, as a result, Roboro became our wholly-owned subsidiary. During the year ended November 30, 2020, we utilized Roboro exclusively as a manufacturing and assembly supplier for our products until such operations were assumed by Byrna South Africa following the acquisition.  On April 27, 2021, we effected a 10-for-1 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”) with exercise prices for our outstanding warrants and stock options appropriately adjusted.
