Item 1. Business
Overview
Torrid Holdings Inc. (“Torrid,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”) is a direct-to-consumer brand of apparel, intimates and accessories in North America, targeting the 25- to 40-year old woman who is curvy and wears sizes 10 to 30. Torrid is focused on fit and offers high quality products across a broad assortment that includes tops, bottoms, denim, dresses, intimates, activewear, footwear and accessories. Our proprietary product offering delivers a superior fit for the curvy woman that makes her love the way she looks and feels. Our style is unapologetically youthful and sexy and we are maniacally focused on fit. We believe our customer values the appeal and versatility of our curated product assortment that helps her look her best for any occasion, including weekend, casual, work and dressy, all at accessible price points. Through our product and brand experience we connect with customers in a way that other brands, many of which treat plus-size customers as an after-thought, have not.
The Torrid Approach
We have created a proprietary fit that empowers our customers and drives loyalty. In turn, our loyal customers provide us with a rich set of data that allows us to improve our product and experience, thus creating a virtuous cycle that reinforces our leading position in plus-size apparel and intimates.
•We provide a fit she knew she wanted but never had access to;
•We accomplish this by fitting every single article of clothing we produce on a real woman, tailoring for her special needs, not simply “grading up” non-plus-size apparel;
•We utilize a proprietary sizing process that is constantly updated through data and our continuous customer feedback loop, until we fit to perfection; and
•We deliver unparalleled technical fit combined with unapologetic attitude and style.
Product
Product Offering
We offer a full product assortment that addresses our customers’ entire closet, including tops, bottoms, denim, dresses, intimates, activewear, shoes and accessories. We believe our products not only provide an unparalleled technical fit, but also have the style and attitude that enable our customers to dress like her non-plus-size friends. We believe we are a destination for our customers to shop for every occasion, from casual to dressy, and everything in between.
While we aim to bring her the latest in fashion trends, we do not rely on being a fashion leader. Our offering is built on the foundation of Basics that represent year-round styles and colors that are constantly replenished and are not subject to a typical markdown cadence. Our Core offering includes products that are on-trend interpretations of our basic merchandise that we update with new fabrics, prints, embellishments or features. For example, the Harper Blouse represents a Basics item with Core iterations that feature embellishments such as zippers or button-loops. Our trend driven items incorporate the latest fashions available in the broader market to excite and engage our customer but are bought narrowly and reordered as demand dictates to minimize inventory risk.
We are market leaders in bottoms and intimates, both attractive growth categories where fit is critical. These categories serve as entry point to the Torrid brand and drive customer loyalty. We believe the design of our intimates line, Torrid Curve, inspires confidence and allows our customer to move in effortless comfort throughout her day while feeling confident and sexy. Over the course of almost two decades, Torrid has developed the requisite design and engineering expertise for the highly technical bra category through a rigorous in-house research and development process. We have patent applications pending for our 360° Back Smoothing Bras and our Power Mesh Panels for Tummy-Flattening Pants, both exclusive creations for the woman in our size range.
Product Design and Development
We are relentlessly focused on creating youthful, unapologetically sexy products specifically for the woman in our size range. We design, develop and merchandise almost all of our products in-house, under the Torrid® and Torrid Curve® brand names. Our products are exclusive to us, with few exceptions, and provide a consistent quality and fit that we believe she cannot find elsewhere. Our product development is led by a team of more than sixty highly skilled designers, artists and product engineers. Our core competency is our differentiated, market-leading fit that we achieve through the following strategies:
•Maniacal focus on fit across our entire organization;
•Differentiated technical fit created through building and continuously refining a database of fit specifications derived from testing, measuring and cataloging garments on our fit models;
•Proprietary fabrics specifically engineered to enhance the fit;
•Fit all of our products on fit models and our staff, not mannequins; and
•We test new fabrics, new silhouettes and new product lines on our community of loyal customers before launch.
Additionally, we employ a data-driven approach to design and product development, proactively and quickly incorporating sales and operational performance information alongside customer feedback from thousands of product reviews, and our ongoing dialogue with customers through social media and customer surveys.
Merchandise Planning
Our strategy is built around a consistent and stable base of Core products that provide our customer with year round style. At the same time, we introduce new lines of merchandise approximately 16 times per year, thus providing a consistent flow of fresh merchandise to keep our customer engaged, encourage repeat business and attract new customers. 
We regularly use the depth and breadth of our data to assess sales, market trends and new product development to inform purchasing decisions. As a result, we have the flexibility to react quickly to product performance, make in-season inventory purchasing adjustments where possible and to respond to the latest sales trends by ordering or re-ordering as appropriate. Further, we utilize a read-and-react testing approach, with small purchase quantities, to introduce our New product offering, minimizing fashion risk. This strategy also allows us to mitigate inventory risk, particularly for new products or styles, while simultaneously providing our customers access to current fashion. 
Customers
Our typical customer is an employed, youthful woman between the ages of 25 and 40 years old with above-average annual household income, and wears sizes 10 to 30 (average of size 18). The majority of our customers are under 40 years old and the ethnic composition of our customer base parallels that of the U.S. population. She leads a busy life, is short on time and wants a curated presentation of quality apparel, intimates and accessories that are on trend and fit her well. 
Torrid Loyalty and Torrid Credit Card Programs
We drive customer loyalty and engagement through our three-tier loyalty program, Torrid Rewards. Members earn one point for every dollar spent and receive a reward for every 250 points collected. The program is tiered by annual customer spend and offers incremental perks with each tier. Torrid Insider members are those who spend up to $499 annually, while members of Torrid Loyalist spend $500+ annually and Torrid VIP spend $1,000+ annually. We inspire loyalty by continuously engaging with our loyalty members through birthday gifts, social media, dedicated customer service lines and exclusive events. Members of the top two tiers of our loyalty program, Torrid VIP and Loyalist, are our most loyal customers who purchase from us more often and spend significantly more than the average customer, accounting for an outsized share of net sales.
Additionally, we provide our customers with access to our Torrid Credit Card Program. Torrid Credit Card holders are automatically enrolled in the Torrid Rewards program through which customers receive points, discounts and other perks. As a result, Torrid Credit Card holders are among our most loyal and valuable customers. Our credit card program encourages customer loyalty, serves as a valuable source for data and allows us to further invest in marketing efforts without exposure to incremental credit risk as our bank partner substantially manages all administrative processes, including underwriting, and bears the credit balance risk.
Our loyalty and Torrid Credit Card programs provide us with a strong ability to attribute sales and behavioral data to individual customers, which informs our decision making process. 
Unified Commerce Platform
 Through our unified commerce platform, which includes our e-Commerce and retail stores, we deliver a seamless brand experience to our customers wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We are agnostic to the channel where our customers choose to shop, as we are highly profitable across both e-Commerce and store channels. We deliver a consistent brand message by coordinating our strategies across channels, which we believe influences our customers’ buying decisions. This customer-centric strategy enhances customer acquisition, retention and customer lifetime value. Our e-Commerce and store channels complement and drive traffic to one another, creating more loyal omni-channel customers.
e-Commerce
Our e-Commerce channel is central to our unified commerce platform. Our online platform provides customers with a highly engaging shopping experience featuring access to our full product assortment, an aesthetically rich and easily navigable website and seamless ordering and fulfillment. Additionally, we successfully use our e-Commerce platform to expand our selection of styles, colors and merchandise meaningfully beyond what is available in our stores, making the online shopping experience highly engaging and additive to our in-store experience. Our website and mobile app feature updates on new collections, guidance on how to wear and put together outfits and a selection of web-only exclusives, all of which facilitate customer engagement and interaction.
We aim to be wherever she is and make the transaction process as convenient as possible. As a result, a majority of our e-Commerce orders and a material portion of all orders are placed directly from her phone. We are upgrading the functionality and features of our mobile app to deliver enhanced personalization such as allowing her to find her recommended size while suggesting complementary items to expedite purchase decisions and increase frequency and order size. In December 2021, we went live with our new mobile app which incorporates a new design and new features such as advanced filter and search functionality, additional payment options and personalized notifications. 
Stores
Our stores are highly valuable strategic assets that remain core to our strategy and continue to play an important role in our customer acquisition strategy. We provide a sophisticated presentation of products that has an emphasis on outfits, which presents creative styling ideas to our customer and encourages incremental spend. Our stores include large, comfortable fitting rooms with features, such as cooling fans, that are specifically suited for our customers’ needs. Additionally, our stores offer customers the opportunity to connect with a like-minded community, through exclusive in-store events and interactions with our store associates, who act as brand ambassadors and are often customers themselves. 
As of January 29, 2022, we operated 624 stores in the U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Canada. Our stores are located primarily in premium malls, shopping plazas, lifestyle centers and outlet locations, and the quality of our real estate locations is high as substantially all of our stores are located in A and B malls or off-mall locations. Our stores are designed to deliver an immersive fit discovery experience and serve as desirable customer destinations. As a result, they are less dependent on broader traffic trends and perform consistently across all formats. Our average store size is approximately 3,000 square feet. 
People and Culture
We have created a company culture focused on attracting, training and developing talent. Our work environment is open and collaborative with a flat organizational structure that facilitates efficient decision making. Approximately 93% of our employees identify as female, and many are also customers who believe in our mission to empower curvy women to love the way they look and feel. Additionally, we embrace the diversity of our employees and believe that diverse and inclusive teams at all levels across the organization strengthen our ability to serve our customers. Nearly 50% of our employees identify as minorities. In 2020, we established our Diversity & Inclusion Committee, which seeks to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace through open dialogue, training, recruiting, and retaining diverse talent.
The goal of creating a welcoming and supportive environment spans our full organization from our headquarters and distribution centers to our stores. We believe that our in-store brand ambassadors are critical to our success and often represent the face of our organization to our customers. We empower our managers and in-store brand ambassadors to deliver a superior shopping experience. We provide thorough product- and fit-oriented training that aims to strengthen our brand experience in the store. We also provide our in-store brand ambassadors with sales and key performance data that help them optimize their store’s performance and foster a culture of accountability. Communications with our store associates is a critical channel for valuable product and customer feedback. We believe we have established effective two-way lines of communication throughout our organization, including using new technologies to communicate with stores in real time and routinely synthesize store insights and customer feedback from the field to influence decision making.
As of January 29, 2022, we employed 2,063 full-time and 6,037 part-time employees. Of these employees, 490 are employed in our headquarters in City of Industry, California and 7,610 are employed in our stores and distribution centers. Our number of employees, particularly part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon seasonal needs. Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Our talent strategy is to attract, engage and retain the best and most qualified talent to create a diverse and inclusive workforce. We offer competitive compensation packages that are based on market-specific data for comparable roles and geographic locations. We believe in rewarding high performance and seek to design plans and programs to support this culture. 
To further support the advancement of our employees, we invest in a wide range of training and development opportunities at all levels across the organization, including through both online and instructor-led internal programs, as well as third-party programs. We regularly collect feedback from our employees to better understand and improve our learning and development offerings to meet their needs. To ensure we provide a rich and rewarding experience for our employees, we monitor culture and engagement to build on the competencies that are important for our future success. We routinely engage independent third parties to conduct cultural training sessions and engagement events. These include diversity and inclusion training sessions, fun employee engagement events, and virtual and on-demand learning sessions focused on emotional and social health. 
Employee safety remains our top priority. We develop and administer company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to our business, our communities, and our teams. As we managed through these challenges, we prioritized the health, safety and overall well-being of our teams and customers. At each of our retail stores, our headquarters and our West Jefferson, Ohio, distribution center, we continue to follow applicable local, state, and national government regulations, laws, and recommended guidance. In response to COVID-19 we:
•added work from home flexibility;
•adjusted attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
•increased cleaning protocols across all locations;
•initiated regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
•established new physical distancing procedures for employees who need to be onsite;
•provided additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•implemented protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•prohibited all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees; and
•encouraged masks to be worn in all locations where allowed by local law.
An important part of our culture is our focus on giving back to the community, which we do primarily through our Torrid Foundation that we established in 2017. The mission of the Torrid Foundation is to support various nonprofit organizations dedicated to helping women and changing lives for our customers and their diverse communities. The funds utilized in these efforts are raised from customer donations, including whole-dollar sale round-ups, and a portion of proceeds from certain product collaborations like our Breast Cancer Awareness Collection. In fiscal year 2021, the Torrid Foundation raised over $2.6 million in support of partner organizations dedicated to educating and empowering women.
Data Analytics
We have a significant volume of customer and transaction data, collected from a variety of sources, including e-Commerce and in-store interactions, our loyalty program, social media and customer surveys. For example, we have the ability to track page views, search history, clicks, linger time and purchase route for visitors to our e-Commerce platform. We use our data to drive decision making across the organization. This customer data is based on information provided by customers who have opted-in to be part of our loyalty program. Our extensive database contains valuable customer information that helps us better market to our customers.
We have significant visibility into our customers’ transaction behavior, including purchases made across our channels. We use our customer database to acquire, develop and retain customers. We can identify customers who purchase products regardless of whether they shop on our e-Commerce platform or in-store. We are beginning to leverage this customer database to drive data analysis and insights that we use in managing our business. For example, to grow the penetration of intimates sales, we are able to offer a promotion targeted at customers who have bought our apparel but not our intimates, which encourages shopping across categories. 
Marketing and Advertising
We promote a message of inclusivity that empowers all women to love the way they look and feel. Our brand inspires women to feel confident, sexy and youthful like they never have before. We believe our brand messaging built around our fit resonates with the attitudes of younger generations who are frustrated with being ignored by other brands. Our marketing collateral intentionally represents the diversity of our customer base, including women of all sizes from 10 to 30, and communicates the confidence and sexiness our product is intended to deliver.
We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to increase brand awareness, acquire new customers, and drive repeat purchases across our channels. These programs include our online marketing, such as paid search and social media, 
product listing ads and retargeting, combined with direct mail, store marketing and public relations initiatives. Further, we collaborate with other leading brands, including Betsey Johnson, Disney, and Warner Brothers to create capsule collections to reach new customers and increase our brand awareness. We strengthen the connection with our most engaged customers through special events featuring plus-size models, celebrities, bloggers and other influencers. We use our customer database to strategically optimize the value of our marketing investments across our customer base and channels. This enables us to efficiently acquire new customers, effectively market to repeat customers and reactivate lapsed customers.
Our investments in digital and physical marketing drive customer acquisition and engagement across all of our channels. We coordinate the introduction of our collections across our e-Commerce platform and stores, allowing a customer to experience a consistent brand message wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We have a large and growing following on our social media channels, including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter. We use these channels to communicate with our customers, disseminate our outbound marketing messages and collect feedback about their lifestyles and product preferences. 
Sourcing and Production
We outsource the manufacturing of our products, which eliminates the need to own or operate manufacturing facilities. Thus, our product sourcing is not dependent on any one manufacturing facility, enabling a flexible and agile approach to sourcing. We internally design and develop the vast majority of our products, a model we describe as vertical sourcing, which gives us control to deliver consistent fit, quality and cost across our products. 
We have a diversified vendor base. No single supplier accounted for more than 12% of merchandise purchased in fiscal year 2021. Approximately 97% of our product receipts in fiscal year 2021 were sourced internationally, primarily from Asia. We plan to continue diversifying our vendor bases by both vendor and geography. We have been able to mitigate the effects of tariffs on Chinese products and we plan to significantly reduce our exposure to vendors located within China. Though we are working towards decreasing our share of product manufactured in China, our manufacturing partners may source their own raw materials from third parties in other countries, including China. We maintain compliance guidelines for our vendors that dictate various standards including product quality, manufacturing practices, labor compliance and legal compliance. Through third parties, we periodically monitor our factories and suppliers to ensure compliance with these guidelines.
Distribution and Fulfillment
Our unified commerce business model is serviced by our distribution facility located in West Jefferson, Ohio. We acquired the operations of the fully-functional, state-of-the-art distribution center in West Jefferson, Ohio in 2018. This 750,000 square foot facility is highly automated and we believe is capable of handling our existing and future needs. Additionally, the West Jefferson facility is already equipped with omni-channel capabilities that have enabled our buy-online-pickup-in-store ("BOPIS") rollout while continuing to drive efficient online returns and position us to execute on our unified commerce strategy. During 2020 we also accelerated our omni-channel offerings such as ship from store and curbside pickup, which when combined with BOPIS will continue to drive both customer acquisition and retention. 
Our distribution center manages the transportation, receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of merchandise for our e-Commerce platform and store channels. Stores are replenished at least once per week from these facilities by third-party delivery services. This frequency provides our stores a steady flow of new inventory that helps maintain product freshness and in-stock availability. 
Information Systems
We utilize a full range of third-party management information systems to support our store, e-Commerce, merchandising, customer data, financial and real estate business teams. We utilize these systems to provide us with various functions, including customer relationship management, point-of-sales, inventory management, merchandising support systems, financial reporting, e-Commerce solutions and other systems. 
Seasonality
While the apparel industry is generally seasonal in nature, we have not historically experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our sales. In fiscal year 2021, no single quarter contributed more than 26% of Torrid net sales. We believe this is partly attributable to our broad merchandise offering that encourages purchasing across seasons. We believe our reduced seasonality is also attributable to the behavior of our customer, who is generally purchasing products for herself, not as gifts. 
Competition
We face competition across a variety of players within the broader apparel industry. Our competitors range from smaller, growing e-Commerce brands to considerably larger players with substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
Our competition in the women’s plus-size apparel industry includes:
•Plus-Size Focused Specialty Retailers. We compete with other specialty retailers that, like Torrid, focus on plus-size customers. We offer a fit-first focus and a broad and stylish product assortment that is differentiated by our vertical sourcing capabilities We target a younger, more stylish consumer with a wide assortment that has broad appeal. We further differentiate ourselves based on the strength of our brand, industry-leading unified commerce business model and e-Commerce penetration, strong data capabilities, loyal customer base, customer-focused product assortment and highly experienced leadership team.
•Plus-Size Focused Direct to Consumer Brands. We compete with other plus-size focused direct to consumer brands. We operate on a large scale, which allows us to offer a wide product assortment, high product quality and convenience to provide a better experience and acquire customers more efficiently.
•Local, National and International Retail Chains. We compete indirectly with department stores, specialty apparel players and mass merchandise retailers who also carry products in our size range and offer similar categories of merchandise to our customer segment. By maintaining a maniacal focus on fit, our proprietary product offering delivers a superior fit for the curvy woman that makes her love the way she looks and feels. Our sole focus on designing for our specific customer needs differentiate her experience when she shops with us.
Our distinct combination of first at fit design, service, product quality and value allows us to compete effectively within the women’s plus-size apparel market.
Intellectual Property
Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other foreign trademark registration offices or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services include, but are not limited to Torrid® and Torrid Curve®. Our rights to some of these trademarks may be limited to select markets. We also own domain names, including our website, www.torrid.com. The information contained in or connected to our website is not deemed to be part of this prospectus. Further, we have patent applications pending for our innovative and most popular line of bras, the 360° Back Smoothing Bra, and for our Power Mesh Panels for Tummy-Flattening Pants.
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to labor and employment, tax, environmental, privacy and anti-bribery laws. We are also subject to regulations, trade laws and customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
A substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside the United States. These products are imported and are subject to U.S. customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel. Some of our imported products are eligible for duty-advantaged programs. While importation of goods from foreign countries from which we buy our products may be subject to embargo by U.S. customs authorities if shipments exceed quota limits, we closely monitor import quotas and believe we have the sourcing network to efficiently shift production to factories located in countries with available quotas. The existence of import quotas has, therefore, not had a material adverse effect on our business. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes in laws, including employment laws and laws related to our merchandise, could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.”
Data Privacy and Security
We collect, process, store, use, and share data, some of which contains personal information. Consequently, our business is subject to a number of U.S. and international laws, regulations, and industry standards governing data privacy and security, 
including with respect to the collection, storage, use, transmission, sharing, and protection of personal information and other consumer data. Such laws and regulations may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules.
For example, the European Union (“EU”), has adopted strict data privacy and security regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective May 2018, created new compliance obligations applicable to even non-EU businesses without an establishment in the EU or in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that offer their goods or services to individuals located in the EU/EEA or observe the behavior of individuals located in the EU/EEA. As a result, it is possible the GDPR may apply to us. Companies that fail to comply with their GDPR obligations, which may include us if it is determined that the GDPR applies to us, can face material consequences including large financial penalties (including fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue of the group of undertakings for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious violations), investigations, civil actions including claims for damages and cease-and-desist claims and reputational damages.
In addition, rulings from the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) may have a great impact on how companies subject to the GDPR, which may but does not necessarily include us, process EU personal data. For instance, on July 16, 2020, the CJEU invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield”) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on such clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances.
In addition, the scope of data privacy regulations worldwide continues to evolve. New, increasingly restrictive regulations are coming into force all around the world. For example, in the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable by the California Attorney General on July 1, 2020, along with related regulations that came into force on August 14, 2020. In short, the CCPA: (1) provides California consumers with new rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used, and shared; (2) will affect several marketing activities due to the CCPA’s broad definitions of personal information and sale, and (3) provides for private actions and permits for class action which could result in businesses being subject to substantial statutory fines in cases involving thousands of impacted consumers where the business is found to have failed to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures.
Given that CCPA enforcement began on July 1, 2020, it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. However, it is clear that the effects of the CCPA are significant and that they will require us to modify our data, security, and marketing practices and policies, and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply with the CCPA and other applicable data protection laws. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, passed in California in November 2020. The CPRA amends the CCPA by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on businesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims and commercial liabilities when the law takes effect on January 1, 2023. Furthermore, on March 2, 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), which becomes effective on January 1, 2023, and on June 8, 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), which takes effect on July 1, 2023. There are similarities between the CPA and CDPA and the CCPA and CPRA, as well as with legislation proposed in other states. But there are aspects of these privacy statutes that remain unclear, and which may result in us having to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer data privacy and security practices are also subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations or material omissions therein.
Our marketing activities in the EU/EEA are subject to the Directive on privacy and electronic communications (“ePrivacy Directive”) and national implementation laws, which impose stringent rules and restrictions on electronic marketing such as consent (opt-in) requirements for certain types of direct marketing and the use of cookies and comparable tracking technologies on websites. These legal frameworks are continuously evolving and being interpreted by courts and regulators. Moreover, there currently are a number of other proposals related to data privacy and security pending before several legislative and regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union is contemplating the adoption of the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “e-Privacy Regulation”). While this regulation was planned to take effect simultaneously with GDPR, it is currently still being debated and discussed by the EU member states. The current draft of the e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in e-marketing rules with limited exceptions to business to business communications and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as GDPR. Regulation of cookies and comparable tracking technologies may lead to broader 
restrictions on our online activities, including efforts to understand followers’ internet usage and promote ourselves to them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Litigation—Failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations and industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws, regulations or industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
