 Item 1: Business
 Our Company
 SmartRent is an enterprise software company that provides a fully integrated, brand-agnostic smart home operating system to residential property owners and operators, as well as homebuilders, institutional home buyers (“iBuyers”), developers, and residents. We started SmartRent with the vision of transforming residential real estate into the next generation of connected communities. Our smart home operating system is designed to enable owners and operators to streamline property management and operations, lower operating costs, increase revenues, and protect their assets through improved visibility and control, while providing a differentiated, elevated living experience for residents. Through a central connected device, called SmartHub, we integrate our proprietary enterprise software with third-party smart devices and other technology interfaces through an open-architecture, brand-agnostic approach, which allows owners, operators, and residents to manage their smart home systems through a single connected interface. Our products and solutions include smart apartments and homes, access control for buildings, common areas, and rental units, asset protection and monitoring, parking management, self-guided tours, and community and resident Wi-Fi. We also have a professional services team in most states across the United States through which we provide customers with training, installation, and support services.
While several of the top multifamily residential owners are current SmartRent customers, we believe that we have only begun to take advantage of the full market opportunity in residential and commercial real estate sectors and in domestic and international markets. For example, we recently adapted our software and applications to target new opportunities in other residential real estate sectors, including single-family rental homes, student housing, senior housing, and new construction homes. In addition, we believe there is significant potential for growth beyond residential real estate to other commercial real estate asset classes, including, among others, office, hotels, retail, industrial, and self-storage. Furthermore, we believe there is an attractive opportunity to expand our smart home solutions into other markets globally and have started pilot programs and/or developed partner relationships in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, and Ireland.
We have designed our open-architecture, brand-agnostic smart home operating system to help the residential real estate industry become more efficient and effective through the use of our solutions. Importantly, our enterprise software integrates into most existing property management systems used by residential property owners and operators. With features specifically designed to increase productivity, while decreasing operating costs, we estimate that owners and operators can realize a 50% return on investment over a three-year period after installation of our smart home operating system. We expect that our customers will realize several benefits from installation and integration of our solutions, including:
•Operating Efficiency. We estimate that our customers can recognize cost savings on utilities of approximately 20% to 30% through the utilization of our solutions, including our connected smart thermostats, smart lights, and leak sensors, as well as through more efficient management of vacant rental units. Additionally, our solutions can be a key tool in helping owners, operators, and residents reduce energy consumption and meet de-carbonization goals.
 •Incremental Revenue Generation. We estimate that multifamily rental owners may be able to increase rental rates by approximately $25 to $100 per rental unit per month (depending on the rental market and solutions offered) due to the differentiated resident experience and strong demand for smart communities. Additionally, we believe our solutions can increase resident retention, accelerate leasing and re-leasing activities, and provide ancillary monetization opportunities.
 •Cost Reduction. We estimate that owners and operators can decrease their leasing and re-leasing costs by approximately 20% to 50% by streamlining the processes associated with touring, resident onboarding and offboarding, and customer servicing. For example, our self-guided-tour solution allows prospective residents to tour a property 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without assistance from property management staff. In addition, we expect our solutions will help to eliminate or reduce rekeying and lockout expenses and other property management redundancies.
 •Asset Protection. We estimate that customers utilizing our asset protection solutions, including our connected leak sensors and thermostats, may be able to realize a decrease of approximately 70% to 90% in water damage expenses and lower insurance costs.
Corporate History
 We were originally incorporated in Delaware on November 23, 2020 as Fifth Wall Acquisition Corp. I (“FWAA”), a special purpose acquisition company, formed to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On February 9, 2021, FWAA consummated its initial public offer (the “IPO”), following which its shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).
 On August 24, 2021, we consummated the Business Combination (as defined below) contemplated by the Merger Agreement dated April 21, 2021 (as amended, the (“Merger Agreement”), among FWAA, Einstein Merger Corp. I, a wholly owned subsidiary of FWAA (“Merger Sub”), and SmartRent.com, Inc. (“Legacy SmartRent”). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, Merger

Sub merged with and into Legacy SmartRent, with Legacy SmartRent continuing as the surviving company. “Business Combination” refers to these mergers, together with the other related transactions.
At the closing of the Business Combination, Legacy SmartRent changed its name to “SmartRent Technologies, Inc.” and FWAA changed its name to “SmartRent, Inc.” Additionally, we changed our trading symbol and listing on a securities exchange from “FWAA” on Nasdaq to “SMRT” on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
 
Our Industry and Market Opportunity
 
Increasing Demand for Smart Home Technology
We believe that network effects are driving demand for smart home technology and increasing the penetration of smart home technology in both the multifamily residential and single-family rental home sectors. Increasingly, we believe residents view smart home technology as a necessity, although relatively few communities currently offer it to residents. Entrata, a developer of property management software, estimates that more than 75% of residents would pay more for an apartment equipped with smart home technology, and Schlage, a smart lock provider, estimates millennials would be willing to pay 20% more on average per month for rental units equipped with smart home technology. We expect this dynamic will drive demand for smart home technology as additional owners and operators evolve to meet this growing demand for integrated smart home solutions. In addition, we believe the same driving forces apply to other asset classes and markets, which we expect to continue to increase demand for enterprise-level smart solutions globally. We believe our enterprise-level, end-to-end solutions enable owners and operators to transform outdated properties into fully connected smart communities that meet resident demand for digital amenities while improving operating profitability.
Fragmented Technology Offerings

While demand for smart home technology has increased, the residential technology market remains fragmented, with offerings generally consisting of isolated point solutions and closed-architecture devices that do not integrate with one another. To assemble a complete building solution, owners and operators often need to source smart home technology from multiple vendors and point solution providers and patch their products together to create a modern building experience. Under this fragmented structure, the process to evaluate, procure, install, and service smart home technology can be expensive and time-consuming for owners and operators. With our holistic smart home operating system and in-house installation, training, and support services, we believe we offer a smart home solution that provides a full-service, end-to-end experience.
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Superior Platform for Owners, Operators, and Residents

We believe we have developed the most scalable and owner/operator-friendly smart home operating system in the industry based on our platform’s unique combination of attributes:
•We offer a holistic integrated solution that includes enterprise software, hardware, and resident applications.
 •We are hardware agnostic and our solutions are compatible with most other smart devices including, among others, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Honeywell thermostats, and Yale smart locks.
 •We have an open architecture that can integrate with most property management systems, including, among others, Yardi, Entrata, RealPage, and Engrain.
 •We provide in-house professional services with employees in our implementation, installation, support, and warehouse departments in most states across the United States, which allows us to maintain consistent quality and service across markets.
 
Leading Enterprise Smart Home Provider with Track Record of Success

As of December 31, 2021, our customers included 15 of the top 20 multifamily residential owners in the United States. Moreover, many of our existing customers have demonstrated their satisfaction with our smart home operating system by installing our SmartRent solutions across their full operating portfolios over time. As of December 31, 2021, we have 249 customers who own or operate an aggregate of 4.5 million units.
Large Addressable Residential Market
 
Some of our competitors have historically focused on creating solutions for new development properties, where installation of smart home devices can be easier. However, new developments represent only a fraction of the size of the market for existing residential properties, which is where we believe we have a competitive advantage. Additionally, other competitors have closed-architecture systems that may not integrate with existing products or software systems that owners and operators have already installed. Lastly, some of our competitors have invested heavily in branded hardware, such as smart locks, that carry low margins and limit their ability to offer flexible solutions. With our hardware-agnostic, open-architecture, integrated smart home solutions,

we are able to readily target the vast majority of the overall residential real estate market, including existing multifamily residential properties and single-family rental homes, new development properties, other products and asset classes, and international markets. We categorize our addressable markets as follows:
•Multifamily Residential Properties. We offer solutions for both new and existing multifamily residential properties that we believe will add value, improve operational efficiencies, and provide ancillary revenue opportunities.
 •Single-Family Rental Homes. We expect our solutions will simplify the leasing and management of multiple single-family rental homes by utilizing connected devices for remote management of multiple homes from one unified platform.
 •Homebuilders and iBuyers. According to the National Association of REALTORS® and the U.S. Census Bureau, there were approximately 6.5 million newly constructed and existing homes that were sold in the United States in 2020. We believe homebuilders can easily incorporate our solutions as part of their newly constructed homes, while iBuyers serve as an additional channel through which our solutions can be offered.
 •Other Products and Asset Classes. We have a robust product roadmap and a proven track record of innovation and product expansion that we expect to provide us with significant revenue growth opportunities. For example, in 2020 we developed our next generation SmartHub, the Alloy Fusion (“Alloy Fusion”) that includes a built-in thermostat and a touch screen. In addition, we believe there are many adjacent commercial real estate asset classes where our solutions can easily be applied, including, among others, the senior housing, student housing, and lodging and hospitality sectors. In particular, we believe the senior housing and student housing sectors have many similarities with our core addressable residential real estate markets. December 31, 2021, we have one student housing pilot in process.
 •Expansion in International Markets. We believe international expansion represents another large market opportunity. Currently, we are starting pilot programs and/or developing partner relationships in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, and Ireland. We intend to expand our presence to other international markets in the future.
 
Experienced Team with Deep Industry Experience

Our leadership team has over five decades of collective experience managing, leasing, and servicing multifamily residential properties, as well as developing and building industry-specific software. In particular, our Chief Executive Officer and founder, Lucas Haldeman, has spent the last two decades developing property management technology for the real estate industry, including serving as chief technology and marketing officer of Colony Starwood Homes (formerly NYSE:SFR and now part of Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE:INVH)) from October 2013 to July 2016, where he led the development of a platform to assist in acquisitions, renovations, leasing, and management of more than 30,000 single-family rental homes. Our deep industry knowledge has led us to create a smart home operating system that empowers users, while increasing safety, revenue, and efficiency for owners and operators. In addition, we believe we are the only smart home solution that provides a full-service experience that includes our in-house installation, staff training, and day-to-day support services provided by full-time SmartRent employees.
Attractive SaaS Model

We enter into binding, recurring revenue contracts with customers that typically have terms of six years, and most of our customers prepay their SaaS contract subscription fees. In 2021, approximately 65% of our customers prepaid their multi-year software contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we have 742,429 Committed Units. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating Metrics - Committed Units.” We expect this pipeline of demand from existing customers to drive multi-year revenue visibility. We further believe that our customer base is inherently sticky given the barriers to entry associated with rolling out an integrated enterprise solution across a portfolio of rental units.
SmartRent Products and Solutions
Our smart home products and solutions provide an enterprise-grade holistic approach to what it means to be a connected community. A SmartRent connected community is a “curb to couch” concept where an entire property utilizes a variety of proprietary and third-party smart devices from various manufacturers and features that can be remotely managed to provide efficiency, automation, asset protection, and ancillary revenue opportunities. A SmartRent connected community can combine in-rental unit smart home technology with our Alloy Access control system and our Alloy Parking system, which are connected by our Community WiFi solution and can be managed remotely using our core smart home operating system, Community Manager.
 We enter into binding, recurring revenue contracts with customers that typically have terms of five years, and most of our customers prepay their software-as-a-service ("SaaS") contract subscription fees. In 2021, approximately 65% of our customers prepaid their multi-year software contracts. Units Deployed as of December 31, 2021 was 339,485. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating Metrics - Units Deployed and New Units Deployed.” As of December 31, 2021, we have 742,429 Committed Units. See the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating Metrics - Committed

Units.” We expect this pipeline of demand from existing customers to drive multi-year revenue visibility. We further believe that our customer base is inherently sticky given the barriers to entry associated with rolling out an integrated enterprise solution across a portfolio of rental units.
SmartRent Solutions
SmartRent software is hardware agnostic and integrated with many property management systems, including various systems and software that promote automation efficiency. Our partnerships with other software providers and hardware manufacturers allow us to provide customized solutions for many different communities and customers, including property management software, customer relationship management, and other software integrations. For example, our existing partnerships with the four major property management systems, Yardi, RealPage, ResMan, and Entrata, are expected to increase efficiency and usability for owners and operators by providing one platform to manage their communities and smart home automation devices. In addition, our partnerships with customer relationship management providers, including ECI Lasso, Knock, and Funnel, provide owners and operators the opportunity to streamline how they follow up and manage prospective resident data received from our Self-Guided Tours solution.
 Our fully integrated, hardware-agnostic solutions include the following:
Community Manager. Community Manager is our proprietary, web-based software that owners and operators use to administer and configure community settings. Our Community Manager software integrates with many popular property management, customer relationship management, and other third-party software products, which enables owners and operators to manage all resident, prospect, access, and other actionable data from one platform. For example, when a resident moves out, management can easily transfer the apartment or home from occupied to vacant, triggering a succession of automated actions. In addition, through our software, communities can create their ideal “Vacant Mode” automations to remove access codes from locks, create work orders for turn requests, and activate energy saving modes. We have also developed Community Manager Mobile, a native mobile application that allows owners and operators to remotely manage work orders and control access, including resident move-ins and outs.
Access Control. Our Alloy Access solution is a community-wide, cloud-based access control system that protects building entry, common areas, and amenity spaces for multifamily residential properties through the use of control panels, smart access locks, and intercoms with integrations to property management software and customer relationship platforms. Our Alloy Access solution offers real-time integration with property management and active directory systems, remote access at various entry points (e.g., amenity doors, gates, pools and elevators) without the need for fobs or separate keys, socially distant access control features for use in self-guided tours, monitoring systems for visitor logs, and real-time door lock activity alerts. In addition, our Alloy Access solution allows residents to create temporary access codes for deliveries, services, or guest access. Our Alloy Access system can be implemented in new construction or by retrofitting existing access control systems without the need to replace any hardware.
Asset Protection. Our SmartRent asset protection solutions help to ensure the longevity of communities by reducing the risk of damage with high-precision leak sensors and smart thermostats. Our Community Manager software and integrated flood, temperature, and humidity sensors can be configured to notify owners and operators at the first sign of an issue, automatically generate a work order into the property management system, and dispatch a technician to solve the issue, allowing management to act quickly and avoid damages and costly repairs. Our flood sensors can be placed under or near any appliance that may be susceptible to water damage, such as sump pumps, toilets, washing machines, dish washers, water heaters, and sinks. In addition to this leak protection, our SmartRent asset protection solutions also provide owners and operators with the ability to detect abnormal humidity levels and extreme temperature changes through the use of smart thermostats, which help protect floors from warping and prevent mold from forming.
Parking Management. Alloy Parking is a parking management system designed to alleviate the resident and guest parking issues faced by multifamily residential properties. Our Alloy Parking solution provides an integrated software system and single-source database that allows owners and operators to assign and re-assign parking spaces, review interactive maps for live parking space availability (based on parking sensors for real-time occupancy), implement a proactive enforcement process, monitor parking management with resident parking decals and license plate validation, and install custom parking signs to monetize guest parking. In addition, through an Alloy Parking management portal, residents have the ability to add or remove vehicles, edit vehicle details, review assigned parking decals, and provide guests with parking access. Our Alloy Parking solution is available to communities as a stand-alone product or as of part of our fully integrated smart home operating system.
Self-Guided Tours. Our Self-Guided Tours solution offers a web-based platform accessible through a mobile application or web browser for prospective renters and buyers to search available rental units, homes or model inventory, and safely tour communities and homes through a completely contactless self-guided tour with no interaction with management. Our Self-Guided Tour solution includes a variety of features to ensure each contactless self-guided tour is safe, productive, and convenient, including an identity check for each prospective renter and buyer, the ability for prospective renters and buyers to schedule a tour when most convenient, and the automatic production of actionable data (e.g., the amount of time spent in the rental unit or home) for use by owners and operators. This technology enables owners and operators to expand showing hours, relocate tours in real-time depending on vacancies, permit showings promptly upon request, and conduct multiple tours at the

same time without hiring additional staff. Our Self-Guided Tours solution is available to communities as a stand-alone product or as part of our fully integrated smart home operating system.
Community WiFi. Through our all-in-one Community WiFi solution, we provide owners, operators, and residents with a strong WiFi connection to power their SmartHubs and other devices, eliminating the time and expense associated with engaging a third-party WiFi provider and assisting communities that experience poor cellular coverage. While our SmartHubs have built-in cellular connectivity, in markets where cell coverage is not available or poor, communities can add our Community WiFi solution to help maintain a consistent connection. With our Community WiFi system, owners, operators, and residents will have access to a dedicated and secure network, as well as a private connection that provides a stronger and more reliable signal for SmartHubs and other devices. We are able to install our Community WiFi system in any property type, including new construction or by retrofitting existing structures, and perform site surveys to customize the equipment best suited to each property.
SmartRent Hardware
We offer a variety of in-rental unit devices that elevate the resident experience and provide multiple benefits to owners and operators. A typical SmartRent rental unit or single-family rental home is equipped with a SmartHub, smart locks, thermostat, and leak sensors. In addition, several other devices can be integrated into our smart home operating system, including smart plugs and lighting (including light bulbs, switches, and dimmers), shades, garage door controllers, video doorbells, peephole cameras, video intercoms, contact and motion sensors, and voice assistants. With our smart home operating system, residents can remotely control and manage their smart home devices and home settings through a single application. In addition, because our software is hardware agnostic, customers can choose from a wide variety of device manufacturers and use their favorite devices together in one fully integrated smart home operating system.
The SmartHubs are a vital aspect of our smart home operating system that elevates the living experience for residents. As part of our ongoing effort to control and improve the quality of our products and solutions, in February 2020, we acquired Zenith Highpoint Inc. ("Zenith"), the supplier of our Alloy SmartHubs. We currently offer two different SmartHub models, the Alloy Smart Home Hub and our next generation SmartHub, the Alloy Fusion (“Alloy Fusion”). These SmartHubs use reliable and secure Z-Wave communication for remote control of connected devices and allow users to remotely manage multiple device settings from one application. The Alloy Fusion, combines a thermostat and touchscreen panel that allows users to control all of their devices from one location. Using the Alloy Fusion on-wall touchscreen device, users can, among other things, review settings, change the temperature, and lock or unlock doors. In addition, users can download the companion mobile application to remotely control their devices, such as manage their home temperature and grant access for guests and deliveries.
We also partner with several manufacturers to offer a range of compatible hardware options for any property, including:
•Video Doorbells. We partner with Ring to offer a selection of compatible video-enabled doorbells. Our integration with Ring allows users to add devices to their SmartRent application for a more robust control system, including live view and notifications.
 •Indoor and Outdoor Cameras. We also partner with Ring to offer a selection of indoor and outdoor cameras that can be added to any property. With battery-operated and plug-in options available, customers have flexibility to select the cameras that are appropriate for each property.
 •Smart Locks and Lock Boxes. Our selection of Z-Wave or Bluetooth-enabled smart locks and lock boxes offer customers options for keyless entry and simplified guest access. With various keyless entry options, including deadbolts, interconnected locks, lever locks, and patio locks, these products can be customized to meet each property’s needs.
 •Smart Thermostats, Sensors, Plugs, Switches, Dimmers, and Readers. We offer (i) thermostats for all types of HVAC systems with programmable options, including forced air, radiant and heat pump, (ii) leak, parking, contact and motion sensors used to proactively monitor and protect properties, (iii) smart plugs to add automation to lights, fans, or other small appliances, (iv) smart switches and dimmers to upgrade lighting in apartments and homes, and (v) a selection of readers, panels, and boards, including as part of our Alloy Access solution.
 Our People
 Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 639 total employees worldwide, all of which are full-time employees. We also engage consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in engineering, software and product development, sales, and related functions. As of December 31, 2021, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our domestic or international employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.

Our leadership team has over five decades of collective experience managing, leasing, and servicing multifamily residential properties, as well as developing and building industry-specific software. In particular, our Chief Executive Officer and founder, Lucas Haldeman, has spent the last two decades developing property management technology for the real estate industry, including serving as chief technology and marketing officer of Colony Starwood Homes (formerly NYSE:SFR and now part of Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE:INVH)) from October 2013 to July 2016, where he led the development of a platform to assist in acquisitions, renovations, leasing, and management of more than 30,000 single-family rental homes. Our deep industry knowledge has led us to create a smart home operating system that empowers users, while increasing safety, revenue, and efficiency for owners and operators. In addition, we believe we are the only smart home solution that provides a full-service experience that includes our in-house installation, staff training, and day-to-day support services provided by full-time SmartRent employees.
We seek to foster a welcoming, inclusive work environment where employees can be themselves and do meaningful work that positively impacts our customers and communities. Our culture is supportive, engaging, and fast paced and facilitates partnerships among coworkers with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Our employees have opportunities to get involved in resource groups (e.g., Women’s Empowerment and PRISM) and give back to the community. We engage and survey our employees to gather insight, feedback, and data about their engagement, workplace experiences, and manager effectiveness. Survey results inform and support our action plans, with the goal of enhancing workplace satisfaction and overall employee well-being and effectiveness.
We attract and retain talent through our employer brand initiatives, employee referral programs, and partnerships with outside agencies that focus on presenting diverse candidates and through internal career growth. Employee growth and development comes from receiving real-time, informal feedback, a formal performance review, career path transparency, and ongoing role specific training.
The structure of our compensation programs endeavors to give employees peace of mind when it comes to health and financial benefits so that they can focus on doing their best work. Our total rewards program enables us to retain talent, reward high performing employees at all levels and incentivize and motivate exceptional performance. In addition to competitive base pay, we have an annual bonus program for employees at all levels and a comprehensive variable compensation program specific to our revenue organization. Both the bonus and variable compensation plans are tied directly to individual and company performance. We also provide 100% employer paid medical, dental, and vision for employees and their dependents, life insurance, flexible time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan with a company match.
Intellectual Property
 We regard our intellectual property rights as critical to our success generally, with our trademarks, service marks, and domain names being especially critical to the continued development and awareness of our brands and marketing efforts. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, and trade secrets, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state, and common law. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners, which include invention assignment provisions for our employees and contractors. We have several registered trademarks in the United States, as well as other trademarks globally. We have also registered a variety of domestic and international domain names, the most significant of which relate to our SmartRent brand.
Government Regulation
 We and our partners are subject to various federal, state, and local regulations related to access control products, such as state and local building and fire codes, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, and requirements for certifications by Underwriters Laboratories, a global independent safety science company, and the Federal Communications Commission.
We, our customers, and our partners may be subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, data privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (including Section 5 of the FTC Act that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information). Privacy and security laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, standards, and other obligations are constantly evolving, and may conflict with each other, which complicates compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. For example, California has enacted the CCPA that became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates, among other things, new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how personal information is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the CPRA, which was recently voted into law by California residents, imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. The CPRA also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023 and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. Further, according to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep

consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Other regulations that may apply to us, for example, depending upon the circumstances, include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the Tenant Data Privacy Act (TPDA) in New York.
 Competition
 Competitive Market
 Given the emerging nature of smart home technology in residential real estate, the industry is highly fragmented and there are a number of companies developing solutions that may be similar to parts of our smart home operating system. We believe our primary competitors are other software companies, which have historically provided singular, point solutions to new development properties and used third-party installation services, and hardware companies, many of which have closed architectures. We believe these companies fail to provide a comprehensive solution that meets the enterprise management and security requirements of owners, operators, and residents. We believe that our open-architecture, hardware-agnostic, holistic solutions, comprised of our enterprise software solutions, innovative devices, and resident application, along with our in-house implementation, installation and support teams, strong engineering and operations team, commercial traction, and focus on privacy and security, provide us with a competitive advantage over our competitors. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for smart home technology in the residential real estate industry continues to mature.
To assemble a complete building solution, owners and operators often need to source smart home technology from multiple vendors and point solution providers and patch their products together to create a modern building experience. Under this fragmented structure, the process to evaluate, procure, install, and service smart home technology can be expensive and time-consuming for owners and operators. With our open architecture, holistic smart home operating system and in-house installation, training, and support services, we believe we offer a smart home solution that provides a full-service, end-to-end experience.
Superior Platform for Owners, Operators, and Residents
We believe we have developed the most scalable and owner/operator-friendly smart home operating system in the industry based on our platform’s unique combination of attributes:
•We offer a holistic integrated solution that includes enterprise software, hardware, and resident applications.
 •We are hardware agnostic and our solutions are compatible with many other smart devices including, among others, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Honeywell thermostats, and Yale smart locks.
 •We have an open architecture that can integrate with many property management systems, including, among others, Yardi, Entrata, RealPage, and Engrain.
 •We provide in-house professional services with employees in our implementation, installation, support, and warehouse departments, which allows us to maintain consistent quality and service across markets.
 Leading Enterprise Smart Home Provider with Track Record of Success
As of December 31, 2021, our customers included 15 of the top 20 multifamily residential owners in the United States. Moreover, many of our existing customers have demonstrated their satisfaction with our smart home operating system by installing our SmartRent solutions across their full operating portfolios over time. As of December 31, 2021, we have 339,485 Units Deployed, 742,429 Committed Units, and 249 customers who own or operate an aggregate of 4.5 million units. We are not dependent on any one or few major customers.
 Seasonality
Our business and related operating results have been, and we believe that they will continue to be, impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. We typically experience greater demand for deployments in the Spring and Summer, and weaker demand in late Fall and Winter.
Research and Development
 Our near-term product roadmap includes new leasing solutions (including an online application for the leasing process and other applications for lease signing and customer relationship management), resident experience solutions (including applications for marketplaces, amenity reservations, rent payments, and work orders), home IoT solutions (including hubless systems, smart appliances, and video and security systems), and building IoT solutions (including energy, water, and air metering). We also engage in ongoing activities in connection with enhancement of existing products, integration with new third-party products and services, and the development of internal applications to improve efficiency of our operations.
Supply Chain
 Generally, our hardware device suppliers maintain a stock of devices and key components to cover any minor supply chain disruptions. Where possible we utilize multiple sourcing methods to mitigate the risk of disruption from a single supplier. However, we also rely on a number of single source and limited source suppliers for components of our solution. Replacing any single source or limited source suppliers could require the expenditure of significant resources and time to source these products. In order to mitigate the potential impact of supply chain disruptions, we have engaged in carrying increased quantities of inventory in our warehouse and invested in building a more robust team of supply chain personnel to manage the procurement, warehousing and distribution of inventory.
