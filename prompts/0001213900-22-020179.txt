ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Revelation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company founded in May 2020. We are focused on the development or commercialization of innate immune system therapeutics and diagnostics.



During the year ended December 31, 2021 and prior to the Business Combination, Petra was a blank check company incorporated under the laws of Delaware for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
Recent Developments



On January 10, 2022, we consummated the previously announced Business Combination.



Immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination, there were 12,944,213 shares of our Common Stock outstanding, 628,573 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance upon vesting of Rollover RSUs and Rollover Warrants and 10,511,597 warrants outstanding.



In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, Petra changed its name to Revelation Biosciences, Inc. Our Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “REVB” and warrants to purchase the Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share are listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “REVBW.”



Business Strategy after the Business Combination



Our current product candidates were developed by Revelation to potentially prevent, treat and detect viral infections or allergies. Our therapeutic product candidates consist of, REVTx-99a, which is being developed for the prevention or treatment of a wide array of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, variants of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinosinusitis, and others, REVTx-99b, which is being developed for the prevention or treatment of nasal congestion due to allergies or chronic rhinosinusitis and REVTx-200 our nonclinical stage product being developed as a potential intranasal therapy that will be administered concurrently with a commercially available intramuscular (“IM”) vaccine. Our lead diagnostic, REVDx-501 (REVIDTM Rapid Test Kit), is being developed as a rapid point of care diagnostic product that can potentially be used to detect various respiratory viral infections. The diagnostic is similar to a home pregnancy test with a simple to read visual readout in less than 15 minutes without the need for specialized instrumentation or complicated sample collection.
Our Pipeline



Revelation is leveraging the human body’s innate immune system response to develop therapeutics and diagnostics to prevent, treat and detect respiratory viral infections. Revelation’s pipeline is summarized in the table below:








1






The Therapeutic Platform



Our therapeutic platform is based on the active ingredient PHAD®, a synthetic version of monophosphoryl lipid A or MPLA. Currently, as part of the platform we have focused on the development of REVTx-99a REVTx-99b and REVTx-200. The current differences between REVTx-99a, REVTx-99b and REVTx-200 (and as development progresses may) include indications, dosage, timing of dosing, formulations and delivery methods of the drug product.

● | REVTx-99a is being developed as a broad anti-viral nasal drop solution for the potential prevention or potential treatment of respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 including variants, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and others. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | REVTx-99b is being developed as a prevention or treatment for chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | REVTx-200 is our nonclinical stage product being developed as a potential intranasal therapy that will be administered concurrently with a commercially available IM vaccine. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





The therapeutic platform focuses on the activation of protein receptors on the surface of cells exposed to the outside environment designed to recognize pathogen molecules. These cell surface receptors are called pathogen pattern receptors, a subset of which are the Toll-like receptors (“TLR”). One such TLR is TLR4 which is most well-known for recognition of lipopolysaccharide (“LPS”). The active ingredient PHAD®, mimics LPS to potentially activate TLR4, without the adverse symptoms and toxicity related to LPS.



REVTX-99a



REVTx-99a is being developed as a broad anti-viral nasal drop solution for the potential prevention or potential treatment of respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 including variants, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and others. The active ingredient in REVTx-99a may stimulate the innate immune system via interaction with TLR4. The innate immune response which is a general first line of defense against viral infections and is non-specific to the type of pathogen. The active ingredient in REVTx-99a, PHAD®, is thought to interact with TLR4 to stimulate the TRIF pathway leading to the production of protective cytokines including interferons. The production of protective cytokines is thought to help reduce viral load in respiratory viral infections.



We initiated a Phase 1 study in Australia in September 2020 and released top-line data in May 2021. The top-line data suggests REVTx-99a is well tolerated and does elicit a response of protective cytokines in the nasal mucosa. Based on the data from the Phase 1 study, Revelation received approval from the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products and the local Committee of Medical Ethics in Belgium to conduct our Phase 2b viral challenge clinical study for the prevention of influenza infection in September of 2021.



The Phase 2b study began enrollment in December 2021, dosing commenced in January 2022, in March of 2022 we announced that enrollment had completed and on March 30, 2022 we announced that the primary endpoint of the Phase 2b study, area under the curve of viral load measured by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, did not meet statistical significance. We are waiting for the full data package which is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2022 to help determine the future clinical development plan.



If we decide to pursue development of REVTx-99a for the treatment of influenza infection, a separate Phase 2 study will be required. Separate Phase 3 studies will be required for evaluating REVTx-99a as a prevention of respiratory viral infection and as a treatment of early respiratory viral infection. In addition, each Phase 3 study will need to demonstrate activity for each individual virus (e.g., Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2) that will be claimed in the indication for use. To accomplish this, the Phase 3 studies may need to be global and designed to enroll at times of the year and locations with a known, predominant viral pathogen such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, etc. to obtain data to support approval for multiple virus types.



REVTx-99b



REVTx-99b is being developed as a prevention or treatment for chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. During the development of REVTx-99a we found that there may be benefit for people that suffer from chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis which lead to the early development of REVTx-99b.



There are three possible mechanisms of action via the TLR4 pathway for REVTx-99b. They are (i) by the possible induction of a physical barrier to allergens, (ii) by the possible reduction of IgE secretion as a result of IFN upregulation and (iii) possible because IP-10 competes for the native eotaxin receptor.



We were granted ethics committee approval from Bellberry Limited Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia to conduct our Phase 1b allergen challenge study in October of 2021. The study began enrollment in December 2021 and dosing commenced in January 2022. Top-line data is expected in the second half of 2022.




2







REVTx-200



REVTx-200 is our nonclinical stage product being developed as a potential intranasal therapy that will be administered concurrently with a commercially available intramuscular (“IM”) vaccine. We believe concurrent stimulation of the nasal mucosa with REVTx-200 upon IM vaccination may provide a more complete immunization. REVTx-200 utilizes the same active ingredient (PHAD®) used in REVTx-99a/b. However, based on feedback from the FDA, we believe REVTx-200 will be regulated as a biologic, and not as a therapeutic, since it is concurrently administered with another vaccine. As such we believe the approval process will require its own unique development pathway to be approved for this use.



We hypothesize that optimal protection from a vaccine requires both a systemic immune response elicited by the IM vaccine injection and a mucosal immune response elicited by the intranasal administration of REVTx-200 developed by recruiting immune cells into the mucosal immune system. We believe that intranasal administration of REVTx-200 will result in improved recruitment of vaccine-specific activated adaptive immune cells (e.g. T cells and B cells) into the nasal mucosa. Biomarker data from our Phase 1 therapeutic clinical study (RVL-NHV01) supports this hypothesis. In particular, we were able to see increases in local (intranasal) IL-7 and MCP-1. IL-7 is a cytokine that induces the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into T cells, B cells and NK cells. MCP-1 is a chemokine that attracts B cells and T cells to a particular site. This data suggest, intranasal REVTx-200 will traffic antigen activated B cells and T cells to the mucosal space. While this data is supportive of the theory, additional formulation development and preclinical testing will be necessary for the development of REVTx-200.



We plan to establish relationships with vaccine development companies with the intention of working with one or more of these companies to develop REVTx-200 during 2022. Initial development will include studying REVTx-200 using commercially available IM vaccines in nonclinical models unique to each potential partnering company during 2022.



REVDx-501



Our lead diagnostic, REVDx-501 (REVIDTM Rapid Test Kit) is being developed as a rapid point of care in vitro diagnostic test (or diagnostic device) that has the potential to detect respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus. REVDx-501 is intended to be a user-friendly home test kit with a simple to read visual readout that provides a result in less than 15 minutes without the need for specialized instrumentation. Preliminary evaluation of clinical samples demonstrated good correlation between REVID and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (100% positive agreement for replicating SARS-COV-2 virus, 86% negative agreement for no replicating SARS-COV-2 virus). We plan to continue additional development during 2022 and once development is complete submit for regulatory clearance to the FDA.



Our Strategy



Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of immune system therapeutics and diagnostics. The key components of our strategy are to:

● | Advance the development of our product candidate, REVTx-99a, as a broad nasal drop solution for the prevention and/or treatment of respiratory viral infections.

BACKGROUND



Influenza Disease Overview



Influenza, or the flu, is caused by the influenza virus. There are four strains of influenza virus: influenza A (Alphainfluenzavirus), B (Betainfluenzavirus), C (Gammainfluenzavirus), and D (Deltainfluenzavirus). The influenza virus is a negative-sense, segmented, single-stranded RNA virus. Through the hemagglutinin on the surface exterior, the influenza virus binds to sialic acid molecules attached to many proteins on the cell surface. Sialic acid is expressed ubiquitously on cell surface receptors throughout the body, which allows the virus to infect many different cell types.



Influenza spreads through proximal transfer of respiratory droplets via coughing, sneezing, breathing, singing, or talking. These droplets can be inhaled or land on the mouth, nose, or eyes of a nearby person. In some cases, influenza viral particles can remain suspended in airborne droplets or aerosols for several minutes or hours, leading to airborne transmission.



Typically, influenza infects 5-15% of the global population each year. The majority of influenza infections are mild to moderate. The symptoms associated with influenza infection include runny nose, cough, headache, muscle aches, fever, and chills. However, approximately 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) in adults. In those suffering from seasonal influenza, caused by H1N1 and H3N2, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate.



There are a number of comorbidities associated with increased severity of influenza. The most significant comorbidity for influenza prognosis is age. Those older than 65 and those two years and younger are at greatest risk for severe influenza infection. Additional comorbidities include coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), cystic or pulmonary fibrosis, obesity, smoking, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, and pregnancy. The primary cause of death due to influenza infection is due to inflammation as part of the immune response (such as seen in macrophage activation syndrome, or cytokine storm), which can lead to pneumonia or sepsis.



The current prevalence of influenza worldwide was at 3 to 5 million cases per year, with 290,000 to 650,000 reported deaths (WHO, 2021). According to the CDC, the burden of influenza disease in the United States can vary widely and is determined by a number of factors including the characteristics of circulating viruses, the timing of the season, how well the vaccine is working to protect against illness, and how many people got vaccinated. While the impact of flu varies, it places a substantial burden on the health of people in the United States each year. CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million–45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.



COVID-19 Disease Overview



COVID-19 is caused by the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (“SARS-CoV-2”) virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive sense, single stranded RNA virus. Through the spike protein subunit on the surface exterior, the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme II receptor, or ACEII. Although the ACEII receptor is expressed on a wide range of tissues throughout the body, it appears the majority of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the nose, through the ciliated nasal goblet cells, and the nasal epithelial cells, where expression levels of ACEII are most prevalent (Sungnak).



SARS-CoV-2 spreads through proximal transfer of respiratory droplets via coughing, sneezing, breathing, singing, or talking. These droplets can be inhaled or land on the mouth, nose, or eyes of a nearby person. In some cases, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles can remain suspended in airborne droplets or aerosols for several minutes or hours, leading to airborne transmission.



SARS-CoV-2 produces proteins that have a negative effect on the body’s natural interferon (“IFN”) response. These viral associated proteins block a key enzyme in the STING pathway (stimulator of interferon genes) that results in a lack of IFN production. This disruption in the IFN production have been shown to lead to more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection including the need for hospitalization and mechanical ventilation.




4







The majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 are mild to moderate, and in some cases are completely asymptomatic. The symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, runny nose, dry cough, headache, diarrhea, muscle aches, fever, chills, and loss of smell and/or taste.



In a small percentage (0.5-2%) of cases, serious illness occurs, leading to major complications including pneumonia and or trouble breathing, organ failure in several organs, heart problems, acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clots, acute kidney injury, and potential further viral and bacterial infection.



There are a number of comorbidities associated with increased severity of COVID-19. The most significant comorbidity for COVID-19 prognosis is age. The greater in age, the more at risk a person is for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additional comorbidities include coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, heart failure, diabetes, asthma, COPD, cystic or pulmonary fibrosis, obesity, smoking, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, and pregnancy.



As of April 13, 2022 there have been over 79 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 960,000 deaths in the United States according to the CDC and there have been over 450 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 6 million deaths worldwide according to the WHO.



Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Nasal Congestion Overview



Allergic reactions are caused by the body’s overreaction to normally well-tolerated proteins called allergens. Allergy symptoms include nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy watery eyes, and rash, each of which may be caused by pollen, grass, weeds, animal dander, or molds. These symptoms are primarily caused by the release of histamine.



According to the CDC, allergies are currently ranked as the 6th leading chronic disease according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Allergic rhinitis or “hay fever” is the most common allergy diagnosis and is a common cause of nasal congestion. 19.2 million adults were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis (7.7% of the general population) in the last 12 months (CDC). In the same time frame, 7.1 million children have been diagnosed with respiratory allergies, and of those, 5.2 million children (7.2% of the population of children age 18 or less) were diagnosed with allergic rhinitis (CDC). Over the past 20 to 30 years, allergic rhinitis has increased worldwide. Over 400 million people suffer from allergic rhinitis around the world, and “direct medical costs in the US increased from $6.1 billion in 2000 to $11.2 billion in 2005, with an estimated productivity decrease of $600 per employee yearly; this cost is greater than diabetes, coronary heart disease and asthma” combined (World Allergy Organization Review of Rhinitis). Nasal congestion is typically due to swelling in the lining of the nose from inflamed blood vessels. Nasal congestion can cause interference with hearing and speech, and more severe congestion may impact sleep and cause snoring.



In a United States survey conducted in 61,655 adults, 14% had been diagnosed with nasal allergies and nasal congestion was the most frequently reported symptom with 60% reporting a “stuffed-up nose” either every day (40%) or on most days (20%) during the month when symptoms were most prevalent (Allergies in America).



Europeans suffering from allergic rhinitis report nasal congestion as a problematic symptom. In a European survey, 59% report nasal congestion with their allergic rhinitis and out of 562 people in Belgium suffering from allergic rhinitis, 53% reported nasal congestion (Bauchau)(Bachert).



The apparent increase in the frequency of allergic rhinitis worldwide emphasizes the need for more treatment options including the problematic symptoms of this disease, such as congestion, sneezing, itchy watery eyes, and rash (Stewart).



In addition to allergic rhinitis, nasal congestion is a troublesome symptom of rhinosinusitis, which is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and adjacent nasal mucosa (Ferrand) (Pessey). Rhinosinusitis can be acute, with symptoms lasting less than a month, or chronic with symptoms lasting 12 weeks or longer (Stewart). In clinical practice, rhinosinusitis is one of the most common diagnosis affecting 1 in 6 adults in the Unites States (Hickner). Internationally, several surveys have been conducted and the incidence of nasal congestion is common (Leggett).



Nasal congestion is caused by an array of environmental and medical conditions. Although not widely studied, the economic burden of nasal congestion incurs costs from the diseases associated with congestion and are known to be substantial. Nasal congestion is reported as the most prevalent and bothersome symptom of these diseases and more treatments are essential to the improving quality of life (Stewart).

Current Prevention, Treatment and Detection Options



Prevention of Respiratory Viral Infection



Current therapies for preventing respiratory viral infections are limited. The main prophylaxis for preventing respiratory viral infections are vaccines. Each year, vaccines are developed and administered to prevent influenza. The effectiveness of these vaccines can be quite variable due to the ability of the influenza virus to mutate. According to the CDC, in some years, the influenza vaccine has been as low as 19% effective (https:// www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm). Several vaccines have been developed and approved for emergency use for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. The main drawback to vaccines is their inability to offer broad protection against multiple or emerging virus types.
Treatment of Respiratory Viral Infection



Current treatments for respiratory viral infections include rest, hydration, and treating fever and/or muscle soreness with over-the-counter analgesics. For influenza, a few antiviral therapies exist. The most recognized is the antiviral Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), which works by preventing replicated virus from exiting an infected cell. For COVID-19 the available options for treatment are limited. The current treatments available include Dexamethasone, Remdesivir, and low dose heparin, to prevent the blood clots and microcoagulations that have been commonly observed in COVID-19 patients. Currently, there are monoclonal antibody treatments available for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although these treatments have demonstrated improvement in symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, none of these treatments alone provides a significantly improved prognosis for patients with severe illness. In addition, the effectiveness of these treatments, in particular the antibody treatments, may be diminished with the introduction of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Nasal Congestion



There are a number of medications currently available for allergies, including antihistamines, decongestants, and steroidal sprays. Over the counter oral antihistamines include Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Claritin (loratadine), Allegra (fexofenadine), and Zyrtec (cetirizine), and nasal sprays such as Nasahist B (brompheniramine). Prescription oral antihistamines include Clarinex (desloratadine), and nasal sprays such as Astelin (azelastine nasal). Some of the decongestants available for treatment include Sudafed (pseudophedrine), Neo-Synephrine (phenylephrine) and Afrin (oxymetazoline). Many decongestants are recommended to be taken with antihistamines for optimal relief of allergy symptoms. Fluticasone is a steroidal spray also recommended to be taken in conjunction with decongestants. Many of these treatments have well known side effects, including drowsiness (“medicine-head”) or increased blood pressure, and these side effects can be more pronounced when treatments are combined.
Detection Methods



While multiple test methods exist for the detection of respiratory viral infections, they have many limitations. These limitations include their inability to detect multiple virus types, turn-around time, sample collection and cost. The current gold-standard is the polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) test. PCR test can detect the genetic material of a specific organism, such as a virus, thus identifying the specific virus types. However, PCR tests are expensive, time-consuming and can only detect virus types based on a “primer sequence” used when running the test. Because the PCR test requires this primer sequence, its utility in detecting viral mutations may be limited. These limitations make the PCR test non-ideal for at-home testing or as a screening tool for respiratory viral infections.



Other methods for detecting viral infection include the so-called antibody and antigen tests. While these methods can be made relatively inexpensively and in an at-home test format, they also suffer from the same limitation as PCR tests in that they are specific for the detection of a single virus type.



This limitation is illustrated in the following example: if you test a person infected with influenza using a SARS-CoV-2 test kit or a PCR test, the result would be limited to solely showing the individual is not infected with SARS-CoV-2, even though they actually are infected with a respiratory viral infection and should seek medical attention and/or self-quarantine.

REVELATION’S PROGRAMS



REVTx-99a



Overview



REVTx-99a is a clinical stage candidate being developed as a broad anti-viral nasal drop solution that may have the potential to be used to prevent and/or treat respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 including variants, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. REVTx-99a may work by boosting the body’s innate immune system, potentially preventing the user from becoming infected or to combat early infections. If developed and approved as a prevention for respiratory viral infection, REVTx-99a would be taken prophylactically (before exposure to a potential virus). If developed and approved as a treatment for respiratory viral infection, REVTx-99a would be taken upon exposure to, or at the onset of symptoms.



The active ingredient in REVTx-99a is Phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide PHAD® which is also known generically as glucopyranosyl lipid A (“GLA”). REVTx-99a is formulated as a liquid for intranasal administration as drops.




We are currently developing REVTx-99a as a broad anti-viral nasal drop for the potential prevention and/or treatment of respiratory viral infections. We anticipate REVTx-99a will be regulated by FDA as a new chemical entity and will require filing of an NDA for approval. We have successfully completed our Phase 1 clinical study in Australia. Top-line data showed REVTx-99a to be well tolerated and to have stimulated the production of intranasal cytokines. We received approval from the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products and the local Committee of Medical Ethics in Belgium to conduct our Phase 2b viral challenge study in Belgium for the prevention of influenza in September of 2021. We began enrollment for the Phase 2b study in the December 2021, dosing commenced in January 2022 and in March of 2022 we announced that enrollment had completed. On March 30, 2022 we announced that the primary endpoint of the Phase 2b study, area under the curve of viral load measured by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, did not meet statistical significance.



We are waiting for the full data package which is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2022 to help determine the future clinical development plan.



For FDA approval, it will be necessary to show activity in preventing infection with each individual virus and therefore, any registration study will be designed to focus on times of the year and locations with a known, predominant viral pathogen such as Influenza or SARS-CoV-2.



The regulatory approval pathway would differ for a prophylactic treatment vs a therapeutic treatment, and as such if we decide to develop REVTx-99a as a prevention as well as a treatment, we will need to initiate a separate Phase 3 study.



Scientific Rationale/Mechanism of Action



The innate immune system is our first line of defense against invading pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The innate immune system is the more primitive part of the human immune system and defends against infection by producing and releasing various types of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that direct different activities in cells to combat the invading pathogen, as well as stimulating recruitment of the so called adaptive immune system which ultimately leads to the production of antibodies. TLRs serve a vital role in starting up the innate immune system response by recognizing different molecular patterns associated with pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. For example, TLRs are associated with cells (e.g., macrophage, dendritic) found in the nasal mucosal tissue and when a respiratory pathogen, such as a virus, invades a person through the nose, TLRs recognize them as foreign and activate the innate immune response producing cytokines.




The active ingredient in REVTx-99a may stimulate the innate immune system via interaction with TLR4.

Stimulation of TLR4 by an invading pathogen stimulates the production of numerous protective cytokines including interferons (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ). Interferons are known to respond to early phases of viral infection and interfere with viral replication by binding to cell surface receptors to activate the transcription of hundreds of anti-viral genes, as well as recruit adaptive immune cells to generate the pathogen-specific, long-lived response (Figure 2). Interferons have well known anti-viral activity (Acosta).



Figure 2. Interferon Antiviral Mechanism of Action







Biological activity of interferons. Interferons activate the expression of hundreds of genes by interacting with multiple cell surface receptors. The expression of these genes “tie-up” your cells genetic machinery which prevents a virus from using it to multiply. Source: Nature Reviews Immunology, Volume 5, May 2005, pp. 375-386 doi:10.1038/nri1604



Both influenza viruses and corona viruses produce proteins that have a negative effect on the body’s natural IFN response (Figure 3). Disruption IFN production can lead to more severe disease (Cell Host & Microbe 19, 181 – 193, February 10, 2016). Stimulation of TLR4 is an alternative pathway to produce interferons (Figure 4).

IFN production also takes place independently through the canonical TLR pathway.    Each of these pathways have a direct role in the stimulation of interferon regulatory factor 3 or 7 (IRF3/7), which translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of interferons and induce the generation of interferon stimulating genes.

Pre-Clinical Data



Revelation recently completed preliminary analysis of anti-viral activity in three separate SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in vitro single-cell assay models. Each cell line expressed sufficient ACEII and TLR4 to demonstrate infectivity and activity of REVTx-99a, respectively. Significant decrease in viral load was observed in all three assay systems, in comparison to the respective assay viral control (Figure 5).

Clinical Development



Phase 1 Clinical Study



The Company completed a Phase 1 study, (RVL-NHV01) in Australia for REVTx-99a during 2020 and received data from the study in 2021.




The Phase 1 study enrolled 48 subjects in a total of 6 cohorts. Each cohort comprised two placebos and six treated subjects. Treated subjects in cohorts 1-5 received single doses of either 5, 15, 30, 50 or 100 μg delivered as nasal drops. Treated subjects in cohort 6 received 100 μg daily for 5 days. Placebo subjects received a solution as drops comprised the same components as REVTx-99a except for the active ingredient PHAD®.



The primary study endpoint comprised safety and tolerability of REVTx-99a and pharmacodynamic effect of REVTx-99a as measured by intranasal cytokine stimulation. Secondary and exploratory endpoints comprised change in serum cytokine levels, treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) and plasma PK levels.




9







The primary endpoint for safety was met and all doses of REVTx-99a were well tolerated. There were no clinically significant laboratory, vital sign, ECG, or physical examination findings. Overall, 38 adverse events were reported (20 related, 18 not related), All adverse events were mild in nature (mild AEs being categorized as easily tolerated and does not interfere with normal daily activities) and did not require any medical intervention. Additionally, the primary endpoint for pharmacodynamic effect was met, REVTx-99a stimulated significant production of IP-10 in a dose-dependent fashion.


Phase 2b Clinical Study



Revelation received approval from the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products and the local Committee of Medical Ethics in Belgium to initiate our Phase 2b viral challenge study in Europe for the prevention of influenza in September 2021. Enrollment began in December 2021, dosing commenced in January 2022 using the following draft study design and in March of 2022 we announced that enrollment had completed.





The study enrolled 30 healthy individuals 18 to 55 years of age who were quarantined for 14 days while participating in the study. Key secondary endpoints include AUC of total symptom score, duration of symptoms, peak symptom score, peak viral load, duration of influenza virus presence, incidence of mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID), and incidence of seroconversion.



On March 30, 2022 an independent, unblinded subject matter expert panel reviewed the interim results. Based on analysis of the 30 patients through day 11 (day of discharge from the clinical unit), there were no serious adverse events reported or discontinuations due to study drug, and all subjects completed the treatment period per protocol. Efficacy data demonstrated that REVTx-99a did not meet its primary endpoint, area under the curve (AUC) of viral load by quantitative RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and the preliminary results suggest the difference between REVTx-99a and placebo was not statistically significant.



REVTx-99b



Overview



REVTx-99b is a clinical stage candidate being developed a prevention or treatment for chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis. During the development of REVTx-99a we found that there may be benefit for people that suffer from chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis which lead to the early development of REVTx-99b.



The active ingredient in REVTx-99b is Phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide PHAD® which is also known generically as glucopyranosyl lipid A (“GLA”). REVTx-99b is formulated as a liquid for intranasal administration as drops.



Revelation was granted ethics committee approval from Bellberry Limited Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia to conduct our Phase 1b allergen challenge study in October of 2021. The study began enrollment in December 2021 and dosing commenced in January 2022 and topline data is expected in the second half of 2022.



Scientific Rationale/Mechanism of Action



Mechanisms of Allergic Response



Upon first exposure to allergen, an allergic response is not engaged. Re-exposure to the same allergen in allergic individuals triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils as a result of allergen-specific IgE cross-linking. Degranulated mast cells and basophils release inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine, leukotrienes, tryptase) that elicit symptoms of allergic rhinitis (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, watery eyes, etc.). These mediators upregulate molecules that mobilize basophils, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes to the sites of insult, thereby compounding symptomology (Alvaro-Lozano 2020). Further, this process instigates the adaptive immune response, or the immune memory phenomenon, which is formed in part by Th2 and B cells that remember the antigen upon re-exposure and can subsequently respond quickly (Bousquet 2020). Once chronic Th2 bias has been induced, exposure to allergen results in T cell activation, enhancing local inflammation.  Systemic responses, e.g., anaphylaxis, may also occur and reactions can be elicited within minutes (early phase) or hours (late phase).



It is important to mention non-IgE-mediated mechanisms that can activate mast cells and basophils (also known as immune effector cells). IgG antibody can activate the allergic cascade by binding to its respective receptor on mast cells, and to complement receptors on mast cells and basophils. In addition, PAMP signaling through toll-like receptors (TLRs; a type of PRR) on mast cells and basophils can activate allergic pathways as well.



TLR signaling establishes three potential pharmacologic mechanisms of action for REVTx-99b



TLR4 is a known PRR of the innate immune system that initiates the signaling pathways to modulate expression of proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 is expressed on professional immune cells, such as those of myeloid lineage (Bellanti 2012), and on some nonhematopoietic cells such as nasal epithelial cells (McClure 2014). LPS is a known ligand and PAMP to TLR4 and the concerted mechanism is well-described.

1. | REVTx-99b may induce a physical barrier to allergens 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




LPS has been shown to elicit immune responses at the site of infection (e.g., nasal mucosa) that mount initial defenses that directly target the foreign pathogen/antigen. It has been shown that LPS induction of epithelial TLR4 mobilizes exosomes from stimulated epithelia. In the anterior portion of the nose, these exosomes release antimicrobial peptides and nitric oxide into nasal mucus that can destroy foreign invaders. As these products are swept to the posterior region of the nose by mucociliary action, the exosomes may also transfer their protective factors to naïve epithelia that may still be vulnerable to pathogens (Nocera 2018). In the absence of endotoxin (LPS), it is postulated that a similar TLR4 ligand (such as REVTx-99b) can mount these same initial defenses to mediate factors that promote immune tolerance. Beyond the initial barrier defenses from the immune system (e.g., nasal mucosa), LPS activity mediates intracellular and intercellular cascades that influence downstream immune responses expected to upregulate anti-infection/antiantigen factors. It is proposed these activities triggered by LPS can also be trigger by MPLA-compounds.  




2. | REVTx-99b may reduce IgE secretion as a result of IFN upregulation 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The stimulation of TLR4 in response to REVTx-99b leads to generation of Type I interferons preferentially through the TRIF pathway (Figure 6). A negative reciprocal feedback loop has been observed to exist between Type I interferon activity and Th2-biased cellular activity (Gonzalez-van Horn 2015). This relationship is illustrated in Figure 6, which details Type I interferon production blocking activation of Th2 cellular activity at the molecular level (suppression of GATA3 expression, preventing access to transcription mediated expression for H3K27me3 and Total H3), which prevents generation of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), reducing or eliminating secretion of IgE, therefore reducing or preventing allergic symptoms. It has been demonstrated that Type I interferons reduce or prevent Th2-biased cellular activity, which facilitates the allergic response. destabilizing establishment of Th2-biased cellular activity.

3. | IP-10 competes for the native eotaxin receptor 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The ability of IP-10 to recruit Th1 cells has been well documented (Sauty; Quian,; Zhigang). The ability of REVTx-99b to reduce allergic responses may be evident in the cytokine and chemokine profile induced through treatment in RVL-NHV01. The interleukins classically associated with allergies are IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13. Although IL-4 and IL-13 were not measured in this study, the absence of an increase in IL-5, IL-9, and IL-10 indicate that REVTx-99b is likely signaling through Th1 cellular activity (Th1 bias), potentially preventing the allergic inflammation associated with an allergic response.



The receptor for IP-10, CXCR3, is present on activated Type I Helper T cells (Loetscher). These researchers found that agonists for CXCR3, such as IP-10, acted as antagonists of CCR3, the native receptor for eotaxin. This is evidence that IP-10 can directly compete with eotaxin for binding to its native receptor, preventing eotaxin from recruiting eosinophils, reducing recruitment of Th2 cells, and attenuating the allergic response.





11







A highly robust IP-10 local response was observed in RVL-NHV01. It is likely this local IP-10 response will effectively compete with eotaxin for the binding of CCR3, preventing the recruitment of eosinophils and basophils. The presence of IP-10, in conjunction with the observed bias toward Th1 cell signaling (a bias away from the allergic Type 2 helper cell population), indicates a possible anti-allergic role for REVTx-99b.



Additional investigation into the mechanism of action for REVTx-99b on allergies is warranted, however, the preliminary data point to a potential therapeutic role in allergies and allergic rhinitis.

Clinical Development 





Phase 1b Clinical Study




Revelation was granted ethics committee approval from Bellberry Limited Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia to conduct our Phase 1b allergen challenge study in October of 2021. The study began enrollment in December 2021 and dosing commenced in January 2022 and topline data is expected in the second half of 2022.



The Phase 1b clinical study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study and will enroll up to 28 participants. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the effects of REVTx-99b versus placebo on safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints include allergy symptoms and peak nasal inspiratory flow elicited by nasal allergen challenge. The study will have two cohorts: one cohort will receive study drug before the nasal allergen challenge (the prophylactic cohort) and the second cohort will receive study drug after the nasal allergen challenge (the treatment cohort).

REVTx-200



Overview



REVTx-200 is being developed as a potential intranasal therapy that will be administered concurrently with a commercially available intramuscular (“IM”) vaccine. We believe concurrent stimulation of the nasal mucosa with REVTx-200 upon IM vaccination will provide a more complete immunization. REVTx-200 utilizes the same active ingredient (PHAD®) used in REVTx-99a/b. However, based on feedback from the FDA, we believe REVTx-200 will be regulated as a biologic, and not as a therapeutic, since it is concurrently administered with another vaccine. As such we believe the approval process will require its own unique development pathway to be approved for this use.



Most vaccinations for respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS-CoV-2) are being developed or have been developed for IM administration. It has been shown that IM vaccination results in a strong systemic immune response, but a weak mucosal immune response. Contrary to this, intranasal vaccination (e.g., FluMist®) has been shown to elicit a strong mucosal response and a moderate systemic response. We hypothesize that optimal protection from a vaccine requires both a systemic immune response elicited by the IM injection and a mucosal immune response developed by recruiting immune cells into the mucosal immune system. We believe that intranasal administration of REVTx-200 will result in improved recruitment of vaccine-specific activated adaptive immune cells (e.g. T and B cells) into the nasal mucosa.



Biomarker data from our Phase 1 clinical study (RVL-NHV01) supports this hypothesis. In particular, there were increases in local (intranasal) IL-7 and MCP-1. IL-7 is a cytokine that induces the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into T cells, B cells and NK cells. MCP-1 is a chemokine that attracts B cells and T cells to a particular site. This data suggest, intranasal REVTx-200 will traffic antigen activated B cells and T cells to the mucosal space. While this data is supportive of the theory, additional formulation development and preclinical testing will be necessary for the development of REVTx-200.



The Company will continue to meet with vaccine development companies with the intention of working with one or more of these companies to develop REVTx-200. Revelation plans to initiate internal initial development which will include studying REVTx-200 using established vaccine and nonclinical models unique to each potential partnering company during 2022.



REVDx-501 (Diagnostic) Overview



REVDx-501 (REVID™ Rapid Test Kit), a rapid point of care diagnostic product that is being developed to be potentially used to detect various respiratory viral infection including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. The diagnostic is similar to a home pregnancy test with a simple to read visual readout that provides a result in less than 15 minutes without the need for specialized instrumentation (Figure 8). Sample collection is simply a swab of the anterior nares (nostrils) making sample collection easy. If approval is obtained, we anticipate the commercial version of the kit to be a self-contained, portable kit that can be shipped anywhere. The instructions will direct users with a positive result to seek confirmatory testing and/or medical treatment.





13







Figure 8. REVID™ Rapid Test Kit Example of Positive (Infected) Readout







While the kit could potentially be used universally at home as a self-screening method to quarantine, one potential early use for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic would be to use the diagnostic as a screening tool for entry into at-risk facilities (e.g., hospitals and nursing homes). In addition, the diagnostic can be used to increase the efficiency of PCR testing by eliminating wasted testing on subjects who are not infected with a viral infection. Figure 9 below explains the concept of increasing the efficiency of PCR testing. The left panel shows the current state of PCR testing with most patients (>80%) being PCR negative for infection. The right panel shows the effect of the addition of the REVDx-501 screening test to rule out virus negative patients resulting in better utilization of the PCR test.

Scientific Rationale



The innate immune system is our first line of defense against invading pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When a respiratory pathogen, such as a virus, invades a person through the nose, the innate immune system responds by producing and releasing various types of cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that direct different activities in cells to combat the invading pathogen.



The diagnostic is based on the knowledge that respiratory viral infection results in elevated nasal mucosal secretions containing viral specific cytokines (e.g., IP-10, IFN), which can be detected rapidly after exposure. One or more of these cytokines can be detected using a lateral flow assay format (e.g., home pregnancy kit) from a mucosal sample collected from the anterior nares.



Device Testing and Data supporting the potential utility of REVDx-501



The Company has successfully translated the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) format to a simple and inexpensive lateral flow assay format assay without the need of a special instrumentation. Initial assay development focused on the measurement of two cytokines (IFN-α and IL-6). Revelation has been able to achieve high sensitivity and good correlation for both IL-6 and IFN-α between the LFA assay format and the gold standard ELISA. Numerous additional cytokines were also examined and IP-10 was chosen as the key cytokine for development of the REVDx-501 product.

Clinical samples were collected under protocol and with consent from volunteers presenting at a COVID-19 testing center. Participants included those presenting with symptoms including fever, cough, loss of taste or loss of smell as well as asymptomatic (no symptoms) subjects. For each subject, a sample was collected using the nasopharyngeal method and tested by PCR for COVID-19 and a second sample of the lower nose was collected using the REVDx-501 swab and tested using the REVDx-501 test method. The results from this testing showed REVDx-501 to have excellent correlation with PCR (Table 1) for replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus (100% positive agreement for replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus, 86% negative agreement for no replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus).



Table 1. Correlation between REVDx-501 and PCR for replicating SARS-CoV-2




PCR vs. REVDx-501 Test Kit | PCR POSITIVE | | PCR NEGATIVE 
---------------------------+---------------+----+--------------
Test Kit POSITIVE | | 37 | | 21 
Test Kit NEGATIVE | | 0 | | 132
TOTAL SAMPLES | | 37 | | 153




Patients who reported symptoms of fever, cough, loss of taste or loss of smell were tested by REVDx-501 and PCR. REVDx-501 had a 0% false negative rate for replicating SARS-CoV-2. These results include patients who reported onset of symptoms within 24 hours of the test, which may make the diagnostic an earlier detection method than even PCR. In addition, the positive REVDx-501 results that were PCR negative for COVID-19 were likely caused by other viral infections. Source: Revelation Biosciences.



In addition to the clinical evaluation described above, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a series of validation studies for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) devices prior to submission for approval. These studies are planned and ongoing and include limit of detection (LOD), inclusivity, cross-reactivity, flex, usability, and clinical evaluation studies.



The LOD, inclusivity, cross-reactivity, and flex test studies are generally analytical laboratory-based (“bench”) studies to test how well the diagnostic device can detect the chemical or pathogen the device is intended to measure, as well as under different conditions. For example, cross-reactivity studies test how well the device works in the presence of other chemicals and/or pathogens; flex test studies consider variables such as temperature, stability, physical abuse, etc. These studies are completed early in device development under standard quality guidelines to ensure the device is designed properly for human use.



Usability (human factors) studies are investigations that enable a device design team to improve the usability of their device to meet acceptable standards of risk — it informs the team if the device kit and instructions for use are appropriate for typical users. Initially, a small formative study of about 10 people, who match some of the demographic characteristics of the intended end users, are recruited to use a prototype of the device. These users are observed by a study team as they use the product. After the users complete the testing tasks, they provide feedback on their experience. The findings of this formative study inform the next usability study, which is called a summative study and includes 30 to 100 users. The summative study protocol is similar to that of the formative study but may include improvements or modifications to the device and/or instructions based on findings from the formative study. The goal of the summative study is to provide confirmation to the device design team the product is developed effectively and safely for clinical testing.



Generally, the final study is the clinical evaluation study, which is the largest study (at least 100 users). This study is considered the “real-world” testing of the product. For home-use tests, users are recruited by clinical sites or other appropriate methods to test the product in people who have the target condition, as well as a group of controls without the target condition. For example, a study for an at-home test that is intended to detect the presence of an upper respiratory tract infection would recruit people suspected of having an upper respiratory tract infection and a group of users who do not have an upper respiratory tract infection. These study participants will use the test kit at home or a simulated home environment. The device test kit results are compared to a reference standard test that is regularly used to diagnose the target condition (in this example, it would be a viral or bacterial test regularly used at a qualified laboratory). Overall, in order to be considered for marketing approval by FDA, users should have minimal issues using the test and the device test results should align very closely with the laboratory test.



Development of REVDx-501 will continue during 2022 and once development is completed we plan to submit for regulatory clearance to the FDA a de no clearance submission.

Competition



The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid innovation and significant technological advancements. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of REVTx-99a, REVTx-99b, REVTx-200 and any future Program Product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, the level of generic competition and reimbursement. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of REVDx-501 and any future product candidates are reliability, convenience, and price. Our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases that we are targeting. A number of device companies are pursuing the development or marketing of devices in the same or similar space. Smaller or earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Given the high incidence of respiratory viral infections, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the prevention or treatment of viral infection, will increase.



If REVTx-99a is approved for the prevention and/or early treatment of SARS-CoV-2, we would face competition from currently approved and marketed products as well as products currently approved under the Emergency Use Authorization, including: REGN-CoV2 from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bamlanivimab from Eli Lily and Company; Remdesivir from Gilead Sciences, Inc.; and dexamethasone. We would also have future competition that could arise from products currently in development, including: various induction of interferons therapy from Altimmune, Inc.; innate immune system activation from Pulmotect, Inc.; induction of interferons from PrEP Biopharm and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; anti-inflammatory from Merck KGaA and Enzychem Lifesciences, Corp; protease inhibitor from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc; inhibition of viral replication from BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; blocking of viral entry from Wellona Pharma Private Limited; inhibition of viral replication from Abbvie, Inc. and Russian Academy of Science.




If REVTx-99b is approved for prevention or treatment for chronic nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis, we would face competition from currently approved and marketed products, including: Benadryl (diphenhydramine), Claritin (loratadine), Allegra (fexofenadine), Zyrtec (cetirizine), Nasahist B (brompheniramine, Clarinex (desloratadine), Astelin (azelastine nasal), Sudafed (pseudophedrine), Neo-Synephrine (phenylephrine) and Afrin (oxymetazoline) along with generics where available and others. We would also have future competition that could arise from products currently in development.



If REVDx-501 is approved, competition would arise from various companies and partnerships currently engaged in clinical studies with competing device concepts including: Quest Diagnostics, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, and Eurofins Advantar Laboratories. As well as from currently approved COVID-19 home test from Ellume Limited, Abbot Laboratories, and Lucira Health.



Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly longer operating histories and greater experience than we have in undertaking nonclinical studies and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. As a result, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our Program Products or any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop and succeed in obtaining approval for drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market. This would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical study sites and enrolling patients for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Manufacturing and Supply



We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our Program Products or any other product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our Program Products or any other product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if REVTx-99a/b or any future product candidate receives marketing approval. Also, we currently rely and continue to rely on third parties for the manufacturing and development of our diagnostic devices for clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if REVDx-501 gets marketing approval. Also, there is only one supplier for PHAD®, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., with whom we do not have a long-term supply agreement. Currently we have purchased enough material for our planned clinical studies through purchase orders.
License



We do not currently rely on any third-party license for our therapeutic candidates and diagnostic devices.



Global Health



We entered into a Global Health Agreement (“GHA”) with AXA IM Prime Impact Fund on December 31, 2020. As part of the GHA for six years from December 31, 2020 (the “Term”) we will (i) provide REVTx-99a/b, REVTx-200 and REVDx-501 (the “GHA Program Products”), if approved by the FDA and/or the EMA, to non-profit organizations and public-sector purchasers (“Global Health Purchasers”) in certain low and middle income countries (as defined by the World Bank) (“Target Countries”), to be determined by the Global Access Committee (the “GAC”), at a price of no more than 30% above the cost of goods sold, (ii) make available up to 20% of the annual unit sales volume, (iii) allocate $50,000 per year to the GAC to work on training programs, and (iv) work with global health authorities to have the products added to protocols and treatment guidelines.



In the event that the GHA Program Products are acquired directly or through an acquisition of the Company by a third party the GHA shall continue to survive for the Term and shall be assumed by the acquirer. In the event that the Company (i) fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approvals as agreed by the GAC, (ii) fails to cure a non-compliance within the GHA, (iii) if we transfer the intellectual property and the successor fails to assume the GHA, or (iv) if the Company institutes any bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, or similar proceeding, the Company will grant a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-terminable, fully paid up, royalty free license in the Target Countries for Global Health Purchasers.



Sales and Marketing



We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize any products that are approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience.



We may elect to establish our own sales force to market and sell a product for which we obtain regulatory approval if we expect that the geographic market for a product, we develop on our own is limited or that the prescriptions for the product will be written principally by a relatively small number of physicians. If we decide to market and sell any products ourselves, we do not expect to establish direct sales capability until shortly before the products are approved for commercial sale.



We plan to seek third-party support from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for those products that would benefit from the promotional support of a large sales and marketing force. In these cases, we might seek to promote our products in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with large established sales forces and distribution systems.



Intellectual Property



Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our kit design, our proprietary reagents and assays and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates.




17







As of April 13, 2022, we have six U.S. provisional patent applications filed: one for REVDx-501, two for REVTx-200, and two for REVTx-99a and one for REVTx-99b, five of the six provisional patent applications will be converted to utility patent applications during 2022. We have two international (Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT) patent applications, one for REVTx-200 and one for REVDx-501. In regard to our REVDx-501 program, the provisional patent application has claims directed to the rapid detection kit and methods for diagnosing early viral infections of the respiratory tract. In regard to our REVTx-99a program, the provisional patent applications have claims covering the use of REVTx-99a for the treatment and prevention of respiratory viruses, formulations of REVTx-99a/b and the use of REVTx-99b for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic nasal congestion. In regard to our REVTx-200 program, the international patent application has claims directed to methods of use as an adjunct to IM vaccination when REVTx-200 is contemporaneously administered in the nasal cavity and the provisional patent has claims directed to methods of adjuvant to allergy immunotherapy. We expect to file a non-provisional patent application prior to the twelve-month convention date for each provisional patent application. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidates, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates. Additionally, any U.S. provisional patent application that we file is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not file a non-provisional patent application in a timely manner, we may lose our priority date with respect to the provisional patent application, and may lose the ability to obtain any associated patent protection on the inventions disclosed in the provisional patent application.



Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.



We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future product candidates. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, service providers, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.



Employees




As of April 13, 2022, we had 14 full-time employees, 8 of whom are engaged in research and development activities or operations and 6 of whom are engaged in general and administrative activities or operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation



The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.




18







In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, its implementing regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other regulatory requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.



Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For drug product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act, FDA must approve a New Drug Application, or NDA. The process generally involves the following:

Preclinical studies and the IND process — Therapeutics



Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed protocol for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is an exemption from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical study and is a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved application. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical studies and places the study on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not necessarily result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.

Clinical studies — Therapeutics



Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects — healthy volunteers or patients — under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical study must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB may also require the clinical study at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. For clinical studies involving an IND, an IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Additionally, some studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (“DSMB”). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the DSMB maintains to available data from the study.



Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:




● | Phase 1: The investigational drug or biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, side effects associated with increasing doses, pharmacological action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The investigational drug or biological product is administered to a limited patient population to identify common adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. This phase may include administration of the investigational drug to patients with concomitant disease conditions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The investigational drug or biological product is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, typically at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. More than one adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical study may be required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Progress reports detailing the results of clinical studies involving an IND must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.



Concurrent with clinical studies, the company usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.




20







In some cases, the FDA may approve an application for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical studies to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations.



Clinical studies — Device



Clinical studies are almost always required to support pre-market approval and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance or de novo clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these studies require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, study monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical studies for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards (“IRBs”) at the clinical study sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical study must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical study sites. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical study is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical study at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a study is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product.



Sponsors of clinical studies of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical study information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical study is made public as part of the registration.



U.S. Marketing approval — Therapeutics



Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s pharmacology chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to annual product or program fees. These fees may be increased or decreased annually.



The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after receipt before accepting them for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information, which would also be subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for non-priority products are reviewed within ten to twelve months after filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs and biologics that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, are reviewed in six to eight months after filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or biological products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.




21







Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.



The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.



After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.



Even if the FDA approves a product, the agency may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as changes in indications, manufacturing changes and labeling, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.



FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements — Device



In vitro diagnostic tests such as our REVDx-501 diagnostic program is regulated as medical devices. Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, de novo classification or PMA, unless it is exempt, or a pre-market approval from the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, 510(k), or de novo classification, and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.



To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.




22







The de novo classification process, provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. A de novo classification is a risk-based classification process through which devices are classified into class I or class II. Devices classified in response to a de novo classification request may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification 510(k) submissions.



A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.


We expect that REVDx-501 will be subject to review as a de novo clearance. A de novo clearance pathway may be a lengthier and a more rigorous process than the 510(k) clearance pathway, which may delay or terminate this program down the road, which could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.



Ongoing Regulation by the FDA — Device



Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:




● | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






23







After a device receives 510(k) clearance or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.



Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMAs.



FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”), requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular QSR inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:




● | warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing approvals that have already been granted; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------




The Medical Device Reporting laws and regulations require us to provide information to the FDA when we receive or otherwise become aware of information that reasonably suggests our device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury as well as a device malfunction that likely would cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. In addition, the FDA prohibits an approved device from being marketed for off-label use. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.



Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.




24







We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices.



European Union



We anticipate that our products will be regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the European Union Directive (93/42/EEC), also known as the Medical Device Directive. An authorized third party, Notified Body, must approve products for CE marking. The CE Mark is contingent upon continued compliance to the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard.
Other Regions



Most major markets have different levels of regulatory requirements for medical devices. Modifications to the cleared or approved products may require a new regulatory submission in all major markets. The regulatory requirements, and the review time, vary significantly from country to country. Products can also be marketed in other countries that have minimal requirements for medical devices.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements



In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other.



There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. The statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are also subject to change.



Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act also codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal FCA (discussed below).




25







The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the FCA in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product.



HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.



In addition, we may be subject to data privacy, data security and data breach notification laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct by both the U.S. federal government and the states. These laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form. The federal government may impose civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting or oversight obligations for a violation of HIPAA’s requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.



HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by federal law, and may have a more prohibitive effect than federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts.



We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is the part of Medicare that covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.




26







In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.



Additionally, the Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. This information is made publicly available on a CMS website, and failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.



In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several state and local laws have been enacted requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical studies and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, all of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.



Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.



Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement



Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.



Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.




27







Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:




● | a covered benefit under its health plan; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.



Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies, and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.



Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.



The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.




28







Healthcare Reform



In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.



For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. The Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, among other things, revised the methodology for calculating rebates for covered outpatient drugs and certain biologics owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and expanded programs designed to test innovative payment models, service delivery models, or value-based arrangements, and fund comparative effectiveness research.



Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.



In addition, further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.



Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.




29







Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, after some pharmacy benefit managers and insurers adopted policies stating that the amount of a copay coupon would not be applied to the enrollee’s deductible or out-of-pocket maximum (referred to as “accumulator adjustment programs”), some states passed legislation banning these policies. Based on a rule that will take effect in the 2020 plan year, CMS will allow accumulator adjustment programs only when used for a branded drug that has a generic equivalent. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved.



Future legislation or regulation



Other legislative changes have been adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% reductions from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved.



Additional Regulation



In addition to the foregoing, local, state and federal laws, including such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substances, including, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous or biohazardous substances, we could be liable for damages, environmental remediation, and/or governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.




30







Government Regulation and Product Approval



Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, biological products and medical devices, such as those we are developing.



Disclosure of clinical study information



Sponsors of applicable clinical studies of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical study information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical study is then made public on the ClinicalTrials.gov website as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical studies after completion. Disclosure of the results of these studies can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.



Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions



The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. These programs can significantly reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a BLA or NDA, but they do not guarantee that a product will receive FDA approval. Even if a product qualifies initially, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review will not be shortened. In May 2018, the Right to Try Act also established a program to increase access to unapproved, investigational treatments for patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions who have exhausted approved treatment options and who are unable to participate in a clinical study.



A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.



Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, FDA will review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatment. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication be submitted to FDA for review before the initial dissemination or publication.




31







Orphan drugs



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation is taken into consideration but generally does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.



Pediatric information and exclusivity



Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA, BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data from pediatric studies that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA has additional authority to take action against manufacturers not adhering to pediatric study requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.



Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted.



The Hatch-Waxman Act



Abbreviated new drug applications



In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent that claims to cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.




32







The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that:




● | the required patent information has not been filed; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.



If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of a 30-month period, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that the patent involved is deemed invalid or not infringed.



The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be received by the FDA, except that the application may be submitted in four years if it contains a Paragraph IV certification. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical studies conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.



The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight months for a drug that has three or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The FDA must also expedite review of “competitor generic therapies” or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.



Patent term extension



After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase, based on the time between IND application and submission of the NDA, and all of the review phase, based on the time between the NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.



For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent term extension. An interim patent term extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent term extension granted, the post-approval patent term extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent term extension is being sought is likely.




33







Interim patent term extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.



Section 505(b)(2) new drug applications



Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application.



Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.



To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of a 30-month period, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that the patent involved is deemed invalid or not infringed.



Post-Approval Requirements



Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA or NDA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.



The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:




● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






34








● | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologic regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.



Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity



The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.



Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.



Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.



The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
