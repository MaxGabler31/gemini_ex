----------------------------------+---------

Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all of the indium from our stockpile. As a result, at such time we were no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. In December 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash distribution to our stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per share (or approximately $3.05 million). The distribution was classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The aggregate cash distribution was recorded against additional paid in capital for accounting purposes. During the third quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors approved a program to repurchase up to $650,000 worth of our shares of common stock. In connection therewith, we repurchased 139,070 shares of our common stock in September 2015 for approximately $200,000, or $1.40 per share. After completion of the share repurchase program and immediately prior to the Acquisition, we had 1,744,569 shares issued and outstanding.
 
On September 19, 2017, we acquired one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding membership interests (“MG Membership Interests”) of MG Cleaners LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“MG”) pursuant to which MG became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Acquisition”). In connection with the Acquisition, we issued 4,578,276 shares and agreed to pay $300,000 in cash to the MG Members, payable with $250,000 at closing and the remaining $50,000 paid to the MG Members upon the completion of the Company’s sale of a minimum of $500,000 of its securities in a private offering to investors.
 
Effective April 2, 2018, we changed our corporate name to SMG Industries Inc.
 
The Business of MG Cleaners LLC
 
General
 
MG Cleaners was organized as a limited liability company in Texas in 2005. In 2010, Stephen Christian, acquired MG Cleaners from its prior owner and has served as its Managing Member and President since. Mr. Christian was a former Rig Supervisor for Nabors Drilling (“Nabors”) from 2004 until 2010. Nabors Industries (NYSE: NBR), the parent company of Nabors Drilling, owns and operates the nation's largest land-based drilling rig fleet and is one of our larger customers.
 
We are an emerging growth oilfield service company focused on the drilling rig operator market segment in the domestic United States pursuant to which we offer the following products and services: (i) product sales for the oilfield industry focused on drilling rig wash, oilfield cleaning, industrial cleaning, fleet and equipment cleaning; (ii) equipment sales for the oilfield industry including, industrial pressure washers; (iii) parts sales for our installed base on equipment, including water guns, hoses and fittings, and (iv) service crews for the oilfield industry related to rig wash and repairing drilling rigs on location.
 
Industry Overview
 
In February 2018, the Domestic United States Rig Count, as measured by Baker Hughes, stood at 978, up 142% from the May 2016 lows of 404. Rig Counts are a measurement of oilfield activity particularly relevant to us, as we sell products to drilling rig operator customers. As a result of favorable operating economics for oil and gas companies, there is a high concentration of rigs and oilfield activity in Texas relative to other areas in the domestic United States. In February 2018, Texas and adjacent New Mexico (Permian and Delaware basins) had approximately 569 rigs operating, representing about 58% of the entire domestic United States rigs concentrated in these West Texas/New Mexico basins.
 
MG Cleaner’s Products and Services

Proprietary Products
 
Our branded products have proprietary formulations that perform in specific applications. These products include soaps, surfactants and degreasers which are environmentally friendly and sold primarily to drilling rig operators, exploration and production companies, and distribution and supply companies serving this market segment.
 
Our branded products have proprietary formulations that have been sold direct via our sales force and through distribution supply companies for over ten years. Miracle Blue™, a powerful degreaser, Luma Brite™, an aluminum brightener and descaler, and Wicked Green™, an enviro-friendly emulsifier used in oil remediation jobs that is bio-degradable, are some of the Company’s top selling products. In total, we currently offer 14 branded and proprietary products used by industry leading drilling contractors in the domestic United States including Nabors, UTI-Patterson, Helmrich & Payne and Cactus Drilling. MG’s products are sold throughout Texas using direct sales employees in the East Texas market (based in Carthage, Texas) and in the West Texas market (based in Odessa, Texas) with distributors/suppliers handling other areas.
 
Service Crews
 
MG’s service crews consist of Company employees who perform drilling rig wash and mechanical repair services for drilling rig operator customers. MG’s rig wash crews typically consist of four employees using company equipment that clean a drilling rig prior to its transport to another location. Mechanic crews generate service revenues by performing onsite repairs of centrifugal pumps, mud agitators and related equipment. MG’s mechanic service crews also operate at MG’s East and West Texas facilities for non-time critical jobs.
 
In other examples, customers prefer to outsource cleaning and repair services where our service crews become strategic to MG’s business solving customer problems and using our products during service.
 
Equipment and Parts Sales
 
Other customers prefer to purchase equipment and perform their own maintenance on their equipment, using a variety of our cleaning products. Through long-standing relationships with manufacturers, we sell equipment and related parts to our customers which strategically promote our future product sales. We currently offer a full line of industrial and oilfield pressure washers along with compressors, heaters, water pumps and combination units. We also sell spare parts to customers who have purchased equipment, which include pressure washer water guns, hoses and fittings.
Rentals
 
Some drilling rig operators, oil company operators and other oilfield companies rent our rig wash equipment trailer units that are comprised of pressure washers, heating equipment, water containment units and related components. These rental revenues typically come in five to seven day rental cycles, and MG charges a day rate for this equipment.
 
MG’s customers include drilling rig operators such as Nabors, UTI-Patterson, Cactus Drilling; oil companies such as Chesapeake and Chevron; and other oilfield service companies.
 
Our Strategy
 
Continued Development of Texas business. Currently, more than half of the rigs in the domestic United States are located in Texas and adjacent New Mexico due to favorable economics in Texas’s resource basins, such as the Permian Basin and Delaware Basin, relative to other parts of the United States. We have initiated a direct sales presence in West Texas, based out of Odessa, Texas, to complement our existing distribution channels for that market area which will allow us to further penetrate that market. In West Texas, the Company has enjoyed good market penetration via distribution and supply companies. We believe that high activity levels in West Texas’s Permian and Delaware basins should allow for further growth with new direct sales. In July 2017, we hired a strategic level employee, from Odessa, Texas, experienced with many of our customers, to support and grow our presence in that market. Currently, the Company has a sales force in East Texas servicing the Haynesville Shale, Woodbine, Cotton Valley and other oil & gas resource plays in the area.
Sell New Products and Additional Services to Existing Customers. We have over 50 customers, many of which are leading companies in their field. We believe we can further monetize our relationships with our customers by bringing other products and services to them that we develop or acquire when there is a demand. As an example, on February 15, 2018, we acquired a product, formulation, trademark and brand for Rig Hands™ that aligns with our current distribution system.
Acquire Complementary Oilfield Service Companies. Our management team has prior experience acquiring owner/operated companies in oilfield. The Company believes this acquisition strategy can be an attractive way to grow more quickly than organic growth alone allows. In our experience, operating companies that want to be acquired often have complementary and many times non-overlapping customers that could have a positive strategic impact to our future.

Maintaining High Quality Service. Our success and history has been built on a reputation of high-quality service. We try to ingrain this philosophy in our Company culture and employee attitudes. The oilfield service business is demanding, and keeping a 24/7 service policy is a priority that we intend to continue to focus on and maintain.
Leverage Access to Public Company Markets. We believe that the public capital markets can facilitate funding access for our long-term growth initiatives, including making strategic acquisitions, however, there can be no assurance that we will identify acquisition targets or if we do identify acquisition targets that we will be able to acquire them on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the public capital markets to facilitate funding for our long-term growth initiatives, or if funding is available that it will be on terms acceptable to us.
Sales. The Company’s sales plan includes continuing to support its East Texas direct sales presence and establishing a direct sales force in West Texas to complement the distribution and supply channels already present in that area. This will be led by a recently hired strategic employee who has a significant number of customer and sales contacts. We also have meaningful sales through distributors and supply firms that benefit from their customers’ requests for our products. Any demand for the Company’s products outside the state of Texas are typically fulfilled through a distribution supply channel.
Manufacturing. The Company manufacturers its products in its facility in Carthage, Texas. Raw materials are procured by the Company and the proprietary formulas for our brands are utilized throughout the process. Mixing tanks and other process equipment are used to make the products. The final product is then stored in large gravity-fed containers onsite or in transportation quantities such as totes or gallons. Third party shipping and distribution companies are currently utilized for certain shipments of product to West Texas. We may install manufacturing capabilities in our Odessa, Texas facility as activity increases in that market area.
Marketing Plan. The Company’s marketing plan focuses around supporting its product brands such as Miracle Blue™, Luma Brite™, and Wicked Green™, as well as supporting its direct sales force. MG participates in industry trade shows, sponsorships and community events that allow its products to be featured. Social media, including LinkedIn, is utilized to facilitate awareness and discussion groups focused around these product cleaning applications. The Company’s web site has been updated recently to create higher relevance for our target market customers and promote testimonials of our products and equipment. For our service crews, the marketing plan is to increase crew counts in West Texas market area so as to increase availability and service hours.
Market Segment Description. The Company views the oilfield services market in three principal segments: Drilling, Completions and Production. MG’s position in the market is to focus on the Drilling segment. In our opinion, the Drilling market is very elastic resulting in its segment being the first to recover on industry up-cycles.
Market Activity. In any given unconventional well typically drilled in Texas, the completion and fracturing costs can be two to three times the cost of drilling. Therefore, a trend has developed over recent years referred to as "fraclog”, illustrating the number of Drilled Uncompleted Wells (DUCs). According to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), DUC’s total more than 7,600 in the domestic US in January 2018. As industry economics improve, the Company believes that the Completions market segment could become more attractive. Today, however, MG believes the Drilling market segment is where we should focus our resources and attention. The Production market segment has been relatively steady, compared to Drilling and Completion, as wells already online which are maintaining positive economics can support operations and continued production.
 
The Company currently believes the price of oil and gas may stay at present levels for several years therefore, we believe our focus and positioning on the drilling market segment is critical to the Company’s future profitability.
 
Management. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Flemming, is located in Houston, Texas. Mr. Flemming was the CEO of HII Technologies (“HII”) when it was a small public company with approximately $300,000 in cash, no debt and plans to enter the oilfield services business through an initial platform acquisition. HII had no revenues prior to its first acquisition in September 2012, when it acquired AES Water Solutions for approximately $2.3 million in cash, a seller note and stock. Following this initial acquisition, HII completed two more acquisitions as well as two additional subsidiary startups in the power and safety segments of the oilfield services business. By December 2014, HII’s consolidated revenues had grown to $4.2 million for that month (or an annual run rate of revenues of $50 million). Falling rig counts, industry activity and oil & gas prices created an industry down-turn by 2015. In July 2015, HII’s senior lender declared HII in default of its senior credit facility, and as a result the lender did not continue to release funds to HII pursuant to the terms of the credit facility. As a result, HII was unable to continue to fund its operations or satisfy its reporting obligations with the SEC subsequent to its March 31, 2015 Form 10-Q filing. Led by its Chief Restructuring Officer, Loretta Cross, HII filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition with the US Bankruptcy court in Houston, Texas in September 2015. On April 15, 2016, Mr. Flemming resigned as an officer and director of HII and HII emerged from bankruptcy protection. On July 13, 2016, HII’s registration was revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The revocation of HII’s registration was the result of proceedings instituted by the SEC, which HII accepted and consented to without admitting or denying the findings of the SEC. The SEC’s findings included that HII filed a Chapter 11 petition with the Bankruptcy court and that HII failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.

Mr. Flemming has been a CEO and CFO for more than twenty years in high growth capital intensive businesses with more than twelve years’ experience in a public company environment. He has significant relationships in the oilfield market place that help provide access to products and company acquisition targets.
 
Stephen Christian has been the President of MG Cleaners, LLC since October 2010, when he acquired MG Cleaners’ membership interests and will continue to have operational responsibility for MG, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Prior to MG, Stephen was employed by the largest drilling rig operator in the United States, known as Nabors Drilling, a subsidiary of Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR), as a Rig Manager from 2004 to 2010. Over the six years he was employed by Nabors, Mr. Christian developed a strong reputation with Nabors’ employees and industry partners. He purchased MG Cleaners in 2010 and has operated the business as its President since its acquisition. The Company believes Mr. Christian’s industry relationships and reputation will continue to assist its growth.
 
Geographic Diversification
 
All of our operations are based in Texas. Most of our products and all of our service work is conducted in Texas. Our products are sold outside of Texas through several long-standing relationships with distributors.
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We provide services and sell our products in the State of Texas. Our competitors include many large and small oilfield service companies. In addition, the business segments in which we compete are highly fragmented. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are: reputation for service and technical expertise, equipment and personnel capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record and price. Our branded products compete against other cleaning products, surfactants and degreasers, some of which are branded retail and some industrial. Because of our dealer status with certain equipment, we do not frequently compete for equipment sales on selected items. With our service crews, we compete with the human resources that drilling rig operators and oil companies employ. These firms may have their own service personnel, in which case we may not get awarded that service job. While we seek to be competitive in our pricing, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on safety, performance and quality of our crews, equipment and services. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest quality services, experienced personnel and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. Many of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources than we do.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
 
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of drilling activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. Producers tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies such as ours. Increased capital expenditures also ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices, which in turn tend to reduce activity levels for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. These fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
The Company serves several major drilling companies and independent oil & gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations.
 
As of December 31, 2017, two customers comprised more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance at approximately 44% and 20%, respectively. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, two customers represented more than 10% of our revenues at 34% and 18%, respectively, and no other customer represented more than 10% of our revenues during this period.  
 
As of December 31, 2016, four customers comprised more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance at approximately 30%, 19%, 11% and 11%, respectively. Revenues from these four customers represented 23%, 12%, 7% and 6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Seasonality
 
Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas and, as a result, demand for our services. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis.
Raw Materials
 
The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. The Company is not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials and we believe that such parts, supplies and materials are readily available from multiple sources. We do not foresee significant price fluctuations in our raw material costs.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not have any patents on our current products and do not intend to file any patents on such products. We protect our trademarks and may from time to time file for registration of those trademarks.
 
We currently protect our trade secrets and in-house intellectual property through contractual arrangements, including confidentiality, non-competition and non-disclosure agreements with employees, and will continue to use such contractual arrangements in the future to help protect our proprietary intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not currently subject to any direct regulation by any government agency, other than regulations generally applicable to businesses.
 
General business regulations include the packaging, labeling, distribution, advertising and sale of our chemical products, such as those we sell, are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
 
Federal agencies, primarily the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including the following:
 

· | initiating investigations, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requiring corrective labeling or advertising, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | requiring consumer redress, such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products, previously sold to consumers, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | imposing civil penalties, or, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | commencing civil action and/or criminal prosecution. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the industry, including the imposition by federal agencies of civil penalties. We cannot assure you that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change or that such regulatory environment, or any specific action taken against us, will not result in a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect such additional regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such additional regulation could require, however, any or all of the actions listed below, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations:
 

· | the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the recall or discontinuance of certain products, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | additional record keeping, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | revised, expanded or different labeling, or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | additional scientific substantiation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our principal executive office is located at 710 N. Post Oak Road, Suite 400, Houston, Texas, where we lease approximately 700 square feet of office space on a month to month basis at a rate of $500 per month. We also have offices located in Carthage, Texas and Odessa, Texas. Our Carthage facility is comprised of a 2,500 square foot building and one acre of property that is leased for $2,500 per month. The Carthage lease is on a month to month basis and is used for our operations throughout East Texas. Effective July 15, 2017, we leased a facility in Midland, Texas for a three year period ending July 15, 2020 at a rate of $3,000 per month. The Midland, Texas facility is comprised of approximately 2,400 square feet of space and a shared yard with several acres of storage area used for our operations in West Texas including the Permian Basin. We terminated the Midland Texas lease effective January 2018 with mutual consent. On January 22, 2018, we entered into a two year lease for a 6,500 square foot building on approximately 1.5 acres in Odessa, Texas providing for three lease term extensions totaling six additional years. The initial rent is $6,500 per month and increases to $8,500 per month at the seventh month of the lease. After the first year anniversary, we may cancel the lease with 30 days’ notice to our landlord. Lease extensions are at our discretion and require rent increases. The Company is responsible for the repair, maintenance and insurance of the facility.
 
Currently, we believe that our facilities are adequate for our present and future needs.
