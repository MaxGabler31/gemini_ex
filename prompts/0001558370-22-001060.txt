ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY

Westwater Resources, Inc. is a 44-year-old company focused on developing battery-grade natural graphite materials. Originally incorporated in 1977, our company has become an energy materials developer. Westwater is focused on battery-ready graphite materials after its acquisition of Alabama Graphite in April 2018. Alabama Graphite holds mineral rights to explore and potentially the Coosa Deposit near Rockford, Alabama that includes graphite and vanadium concentrations. In the fourth quarter of 2021, AGP, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westwater Resources, commenced construction activities related to the Coosa Plant near Kellyton, Alabama (“Coosa Plant”). The Company anticipates that Phase I of the Coosa Plant will be completed in the first half of 2023. The Company is currently executing an exploration plan to further investigate the size and extent of both graphite and vanadium mineral concentrations at the Coosa Deposit, and to increase our knowledge of the deposit as a whole. 
In 2020, the Company sold its subsidiaries engaged in the uranium business in Texas and New Mexico to enCore and discontinued its uranium business. See Note 12 to the financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.



Our principal executive offices are located at 6950 South Potomac Street, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80112, and our telephone number is (303) 531-0516. Our website is located at www.westwaterresources.net. Information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. As of February 10, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had 15 employees.

OUR STRATEGY

Our strategy is to increase shareholder value by advancing our battery-grade graphite business. The acquisition of Alabama Graphite in April 2018 provides the Company with the opportunity to provide critical raw materials utilized by the growing market for electric automobiles, trucks and buses, consumer electronics, as well as grid-based storage devices. In 2020, the global battery market consumed an estimated 290,000 tonnes of natural and synthetic graphite, and demand is projected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 21% over the next 10-year period, according to Roskill.



Our goal for the graphite business is to develop a battery-graphite manufacturing business in Alabama that produces low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products for battery manufacturers. In 2020, we began operation of a pilot program, designed both to manufacture battery-grade graphite materials in quantities suitable for potential customer testing and to inform the DFS. Both the pilot program and DFS were completed during the fourth quarter of 2021. 
In late 2021, we began construction of Phase I of the Coosa Plant that is expected to purify readily available graphite flake concentrates to >99.5% pure carbon. Once purified, the graphite can be further processed into advanced component products with enhanced conductivity performance needed by battery manufacturers. These advanced graphite products are ULTRA-CSPG™, and ULTRA-PMG™. 


Additionally, we hold mineral rights to over 40,000-plus acres for future mining development. The graphite deposit at the Coosa Deposit is expected to serve as future feedstock for the Coosa Plant and provide in-house quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) for raw-material inputs. Subject to further exploration, its own definitive feasibility study, the availability of financing, and regulatory approvals, the Coosa Deposit and related mining operation is planned for start-up in 2028. 
Our project pipeline is prioritized with a goal of achieving sustainable battery-grade graphite production over time to take advantage of rising and/or high price environments for battery materials. We may adjust near-term and long-term business priorities in accordance with market conditions.

We believe that our broad base of mining and processing and manufacturing expertise from graphite, base and precious metals to energy materials is one of our key competitive advantages. We also believe that Westwater possesses a unique combination of battery-materials knowledge and extensive project-execution experience, coupled with decades of capital markets expertise which makes our business a powerful presence in the new energy marketplace. We intend to advance the Company’s project towards production, while prudently managing our cash and liquidity position for financial flexibility.

KEY BUSINESS AND CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2021
Graphite Processing Pilot Programs
During 2021, the Company completed its pilot program at Dorfner Anzaplan’s facilities near Amberg, Germany, as well as at facilities in Frankfurt, Germany, Chicago, Illinois and Buffalo, New York. The combined effort at these facilities produced approximately 13 metric tonnes of Westwater’s three battery-grade graphite products: ULTRA-PMG™, ULTRA-CSPG™ and ULTRA-DEXDG™, which were previously produced at a bench scale.
As of December 31, 2021, Westwater had produced through the pilot program:

● | 10.8 metric tonnes of ULTRA-PMG™ in six sizes (6, 8, 10, 15, 30 and 44 microns): Production is now complete, and samples have been packaged and shipped to laboratories and potential customers for testing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 2.0 metric tonnes of the precursor (spherical purified graphite) for ULTRA-CSPG™ in three sizes (10, 18 and 24 microns): Production of this product is now complete and has been sent to a laboratory for pitch coating to make ULTRA-CSPG™, and test its electrical performance. Samples of this material have also been sent to potential customers for testing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 0.4 metric tonnes of ULTRA-DEXDG™: Production is now complete and samples were packaged and shipped to a laboratory for testing. Westwater plans to evaluate additional production of ULTRA-DEXDG™ in future phases of its business plan, dependent on results from further testing and the market demand for this product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Westwater undertook its pilot program operations to inform and enhance design work for the Coosa Plant and to produce products for testing by potential customers. The information from the pilot program was incorporated into the DFS. Due to market interest and demand, we are focusing on the production of ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG Fines during Phase I of the Coosa Plant.
Coosa Plant Site Selection
On June 22, 2021, AGP entered into incentive agreements with the State of Alabama and local municipalities for the siting of the Coosa Plant in Coosa County, Alabama. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection with the construction of the processing facility. The estimated tax credits and incentives pursuant to the incentive agreements are estimated by the State of Alabama at approximately $36 million. However, our ability to realize the tax credits and incentives is dependent upon actual capital invested, creating and maintaining jobs in Alabama, and the generation of future taxable income in Alabama. 
On July 23, 2021, AGP entered into a land lease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority, providing AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate the Coosa Plant. The lease has a term of 10-years, a nominal lease payment, and transfer of title to AGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the lease. At lease inception, the Company estimated the fair value of the land to be approximately $1.4 million.

Definitive Feasibility Study on the Coosa Plant
On October 11, 2021, the Company announced the results of the DFS pertaining to Phase I of its Coosa Plant. The Company intends to develop the Coosa Plant to purify natural graphite concentrates and to produce battery ready graphite products in two phases. As of the date of the DFS, the capital costs of Phase I of the Coosa Plant are estimated at $202 million. Beginning in the first half of 2023, the Coosa Plant is expected to begin producing from purchased feedstock from outside sources until at least 2028, after which the Company expects to produce graphite feedstock from its Coosa Deposit. After processing and purification, the Company expects approximately 7,500 mt per year of two products to be commercially available in the following quantities:
●ULTRA-CSPG™: 3,700 mt per year
●Fine Products from SPG milling: 3,800 mt per year
●Project Duration: 35 years
●Pre-Tax NPV-8 percent: $119 million
●IRR: 15%
●Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow (After the year 2024): $24 million per year
●Project Pre-Tax Cash Flow: $656 million.

Also on October 11, 2021, the Company announced a plan and design for Phase II of the Coosa Plant at a pre-feasibility study level (“PFS”). As of the date of the DFS, the PFS for Phase II of the Coosa Plant estimates additional capital costs of $464 million, and after processing and purification, the Company expects approximately 32,400 mt per year of two products will be available in the following quantities:
●ULTRA-CSPG™: 15,800 mt per year
●Fine Products from SPG milling: 16,600 mt per year
●Project Duration: 35 years
●Pre-Tax NPV-8 percent: $767 million
●IRR: 20.5%
●Average Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow (After the year 2024): $129 million
●Project Pre-Tax Cash Flow: $3.7 billion

The Company intends to initiate a definitive feasibility study for Phase II upon, or before, the completion and commissioning of Phase I of the Coosa Plant.
Approval of Construction of Phase I 
On October 11, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved estimated expenditures of $202 million to execute the construction and commissioning plan for Phase I of the Coosa Plant. 
Construction Progress on Phase I of the Coosa Plant
On October 13, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of two buildings by its subsidiary AGP that total 90,000 sq. ft. in size, to support the development of the Coosa Plant.  These buildings will be used for administrative offices, a laboratory, and warehousing space, and each are adjacent to the Coosa Plant site. The purchase of these two buildings avoids the need for certain construction activities. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Westwater began design and construction activities related to the future administrative offices for the Coosa Plant.
In November 2021, Westwater established the construction management process and team for Phase I of the Coosa Plant. Key partners in the team were hired:  Fite Construction as the construction manager; and Samuels Engineering for engineering and procurement. Construction activities began in December 2021.   We are working to secure other contractors and have focused on ordering specialized equipment that have long lead times from manufacturers that were identified in, and were part of, the DFS.

Vanadium Target Identification 
In late November 2018, Westwater announced the discovery of a concentration of vanadium mineralization at several locations in the graphitic schists at the Coosa Deposit. Westwater subsequently commenced the first of a four-phase exploration program designed to determine the extent, character and quality of the vanadium mineralization at the Coosa Deposit. The first phase demonstrated widespread positive values for vanadium that extended beyond the graphite deposit. 

OVERVIEW OF THE BATTERY GRAPHITE INDUSTRY
Graphite is the name given to a common form of the element carbon. Occurring naturally as a mineral in deposits around the world, graphite is used in many industrial applications. These end uses take advantage of graphite’s natural characteristics, which include high lubricity, high resistance to corrosion, ability to withstand high temperatures while remaining highly stable, and excellent conductivity of heat and electricity.
In recent years, graphite has become an essential component in the production of all types of electrical storage batteries. Graphite’s role will continue to be important as demand for these batteries increases and with the world’s growing electric-vehicle and energy-storage needs. Natural battery-ready graphite products are derived from flake graphite that has been transformed through a series of specialty downstream processes into various battery graphite products. These processes include, but are not limited to:

● | Purification to battery-grade carbon with graphitic (Cg) content of ≥ 99.95%,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Micronization (sizing);
--+------------------------


● | Spheronization (shaping), and classification (sorting); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Surface treatment (carbon coating).
--+------------------------------------

Natural flake graphite is increasingly supplanting the use of synthetic graphite in battery applications, for cost and performance reasons. Through a series of sophisticated and precise processing steps, flake-graphite concentrates are transformed into high-value end products for the battery industry. Coated spherical purified graphite is used as graphite anode or anode active material in lithium-ion batteries.
The global battery market consumed 217,000 tonnes of natural graphite in 2020 (Roskill, 2020). The greatest share of this market is made up of four battery-market segments that require advanced battery-grade graphite products:

● | Lithium-Ion batteries — these are the most advanced batteries used in everything from mobile phones and hand tools to laptop computers and electric vehicles, particularly because of the rechargeable nature of the batteries. Demand for lithium-ion batteries accounted for 29% of natural graphite demand in 2020, which is projected to grow to 78% in 2030 (Benchmark, 2021).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alkaline batteries — these are the most popular consumer batteries in the world, with a global market size of approximately $7.6 billion in 2020 and a projected compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4.9% from 2021 through 2028 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lead Acid batteries — these are the workhorse batteries used in automobiles, back-up power supplies and other energy-storage applications where weight is less important than capacity. The global lead acid battery market was estimated at approximately $39.7 billion in 2018 and a projected CAGR of 5.24% from 2019 through 2026 (Allied Market Research, 2020). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




● | Primary Lithium batteries — these are non-rechargeable, lightweight lithium-based batteries, and are typically used in flashlights, smoke detectors, and other small device applications where long life and lightweight matters most.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of these batteries use graphite as a critical, non-substitutable constituent. According to Roskill, batteries accounted for an estimated 290,000 tonnes of natural and synthetic graphite consumption in 2020, and was growing at a CAGR of 21.3% over the previous 10 years (Roskill, 2020). Based on Roskill’s base case scenario, this rate of growth could continue over the next decade, with graphite consumption in batteries reaching 1,800,000 tonnes in 2030, of which over 1,200,000 tonnes is projected to be natural graphite. According to Benchmark, spherical graphite demand is expected to increase to approximately 2,500,000 tonnes per year in 2035, compared to a forecasted supply in 2035 of approximately 500,000 tonnes per year. 
Competition between natural and synthetic graphite is expected to continue in lithium-ion batteries with price, performance and availability affecting the choice between them. Common precursor materials in the production of synthetic graphite come from either petroleum needle coke, or coal needle coke. However, synthetic graphite and natural graphite blends are becoming a popular choice for EV applications to optimize performance and cost by taking advantage of each graphite attribute such as cycle life, energy density and cost. Synthetic graphite consumption by anode manufacturers is expected to grow because of the concentration of the industry in China; however, natural flake graphite demand is forecast to grow at a higher rate because of natural graphite’s performance and cost efficiencies.
In addition, natural graphite flake costs and purification costs in China have increased due to environmental costs (hydrofluoric acid handling cost). In fact, China has become one of the major importers for natural graphite flake relying upon less expensive African sources. China also poses a geopolitical risk particularly to EU and US regions.
Overall battery consumption is rising at an accelerated growth rate due to recent and robust developments in electric-automobile markets, personal electronic devices, electrical grid storage, and an enabling technology for wind and solar power installation. The global shift towards low- and zero-emissions vehicles and power sources will continue to drive increasing demand for graphite-battery materials for the foreseeable future. Recent developments in this sector include:

● | The United Kingdom and France have announced a prohibition on the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. Electric vehicles using battery storage are the only viable technology that can satisfy the demands for new cars mandated by these nations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | China, the largest new-car market in the world, has mandated that 8% of all new cars sold are to be plug-in hybrid, battery electric or fuel-cell powered;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Many major automobile companies have developed, or are developing, an electric-based technology to replace internal-combustion engines, many of whom have publicly announced plans to transition to fully electric vehicles within the next 20 years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Battery manufactures and major automobile companies have announced plans to develop thirteen different battery manufacturing facilities in the United States in the near future;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Governments around the world, including the United States, continue to incentivize electric-vehicle ownership through subsidies and other incentives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The installed base of wind and solar power electrical-generating systems is increasing every year. Grid battery storage is the answer to increasing system reliability and unlocking the value of these power sources; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As a result of these catalysts, and according to Roskill, the Lithium-Ion battery market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 20%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A significant challenge for battery manufacturers is that the primary source of battery-grade graphite is from China, presenting the global battery industry with significant risks, including supply chain management risks, economic risks and environmental unsustainability. Also, critical domestic production is absent in the United States. A Presidential Executive Order signed September 30, 2020 includes graphite on its list of minerals critical to the safety and security of the United States. With little current domestic natural graphite production of any kind, the United States is presently required to source most of its battery graphite from China. On February 24, 2021, the President signed an Executive Order that seeks to provide for more resilient supply chains to revitalize and rebuild domestic manufacturing capacity and maintain America’s competitive edge in research and development. The President’s declaration asked the Secretary of Energy, as part of larger study involving several branches of the United States government, to submit a report identifying risks to the supply chain for high-capacity batteries including those that power electric vehicles. On June 8, 2021, the White House released a response to the findings of this study in support of securing an end-to-end domestic supply chain for advanced batteries, including investment in domestic production and processing of critical minerals. Key recommendations in the June 8, 2021 release include, among other things, providing funding and financial incentives to encourage consumer adoption of electric vehicles, providing financing to support advanced battery production, and investing in the development of next generation batteries.
Westwater has developed graphite-purification technology and advanced product-development processes to meet the demands of potential customers for battery-grade graphite materials. Westwater is developing methodologies and facilities to produce high-purity, battery-grade graphite products at its Coosa Plant. These products are designed to address all major battery sectors. In addition, the processes we intend to use are environmentally sustainable and permittable in the United States, where a robust regulatory environment complements our core values to reliably deliver safe, well-made products to our customers.

OVERVIEW OF THE VANADIUM INDUSTRY
Vanadium is a lightweight metal used in the construction industry, in high strength steel alloys, and in some large grid storage batteries. A majority of annual vanadium consumption is utilized by the steel industry, where additions of the metal to conventional steel materials adds strength and corrosion resistance. Importantly for Westwater, demand for vanadium flow batteries is increasing as solar and wind power generators seek to make their installations more reliable electricity providers. 
Currently, the majority of all vanadium is produced in South Africa, China and Russia. There is no significant production of vanadium currently in the United States.



COMPETITION
In the production and marketing of graphite, there are a number of producing entities globally, some of which are government controlled and several of which have significant capitalization. For instance, approximately 80% of natural graphite global supply comes from China.
With respect to sales of graphite, the Company expects to compete primarily based on price. We intend to market graphite directly to users of the product. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We compete with multiple graphite exploration, development and production companies.

WESTWATER’S COOSA PROJECT
Coosa Plant
On June 22, 2021, AGP entered into incentive agreements with the State of Alabama and local municipalities for the siting of the Coosa Plant near Kellyton, Alabama. The incentive agreements provide certain tax credits and incentives under the Alabama Jobs Act in connection with the construction of the Coosa Plant.
On July 23, 2021, AGP executed a land lease with the Lake Martin Area Industrial Development Authority, providing AGP rights to approximately 70 acres to construct and operate the Coosa Plant. The lease has a term of 10 years, 

12



a nominal lease payment, and transfer of title to AGP at the end of the lease term. Further, the lease provides AGP the option to purchase the land for a nominal amount during the term of the lease. 
On October 13, 2021, AGP completed the purchase of two buildings that total approximately 90,000 sq. ft. to support the development of the Coosa Plant.  These buildings will be used for administrative offices, a laboratory, and warehousing space, and each are adjacent to the Coosa Plant. 
Westwater plans to develop the Coosa Plant in two phases (Phases I and II). 
Phase I: Beginning in the first half of 2023, the Coosa Plant is expected to produce approximately 7,500 mt of two products, ULTRA-CSPG™, and SPG Fines, which is a precursor product for ULTRA-PMG™. After processing and purification, the two products are expected to be available in the following quantities:
●ULTRA-CSPG™: 


3,700 mt per year
●SPG Fines:



3,800 mt per year
Phase II: Upon completion of Phase II, after processing and purification, approximately 32,400 mt of two products are expected to be available in the following quantities:
●ULTRA-CSPG™: 


15,800 mt per year
●SPG Fines:



16,600 mt per year
Construction activities for Phase I of the Coosa Plant began in the fourth quarter of 2021 and construction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. The Company intends to initiate a definitive feasibility study for Phase II upon, or before, the completion of Phase I.
Purification and Post-Processing Activities
The purification of the graphite concentrate at the Coosa Plant is expected to be performed using a proprietary, patent pending purification process that was developed and tested during our pilot program by Dorfner Anzaplan and other engineering consultants. Once the graphite is purified to a minimum graphite carbon content of 99.95%, we will then process it through a combination of sizing, shaping, spheronization, classification and coating to the advanced graphite products we intend to sell.
The Company has developed a new method for the purification of graphite concentrate. The process uses a combination of technologies including a caustic bake, acid leach and thermal finishing, a process that allows for a smaller and more sustainable environmental footprint than that of a hydrofluoric acid leaching system as used by other graphite processing companies. This unique application developed by Westwater is the subject of patent applications that have been filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
We intend to purchase readily available graphite flake from a qualified supplier, for which a procurement contract is currently in place, to serve as plant feedstock for the Coosa Plant while the Coosa Deposit is being evaluated, permitted, and developed for future mining operations. Development of a mine at the Coosa Deposit, planned for start-up in 2028, will serve as an in-house source of graphite feedstock and will provide in-house QA/QC for raw-material inputs. 
Description of the Coosa Deposit
Westwater acquired Alabama Graphite in 2018 as part of a strategic decision to refocus the Company to supply battery manufacturers with low-cost, high-quality, and high-margin graphite products. As a result of that business transaction, Westwater became the owner of the Coosa Deposit, located near Rockford, Alabama, 50 miles southeast of Birmingham. 

13



The Coosa Deposit is located at the southern end of the Appalachian Mountain range, in Coosa County, Alabama. The Coosa Deposit is located in an area that has been a past producer of graphite, utilizing a geology trend spanning tens of thousands of acres, known as the “Alabama Graphite Belt.” 
The Coosa Deposit is comprised of approximately 41,965 acres of privately-owned mineral rights that the Company holds under a long-term lease.
The Coosa Deposit is hosted in high-grade metamorphic rocks. Graphitic material is present in two types of schist, a quartz-graphite schist that generally has grades greater than 1% Cg and a quartz-biotite-graphite-schist that has grades generally less than 1% Cg. The uppermost 60-100 feet of the graphite-bearing rocks have been weathered and oxidized such that they could be easily mined by simple excavation equipment without any blasting. As currently defined, mining will mainly be centered on these weathered units.
Prior to the acquisition of Alabama Graphite by Westwater, a mineral resource estimate for the Coosa Deposit, as set forth in a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) was prepared by Alabama Graphite. This assessment was prepared and published in accordance with the National Instrument 43-101 Standard of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) on Number 27, 2015. As noted, during 2021, Westwater has continued its exploration program to further investigate the size and extent of both graphite and vanadium mineral concentrations at the Coosa Deposit drilling 54 holes totaling 4,461 feet drilled. Westwater anticipates completing its exploration program during the first quarter of 2022. Following the completion of its exploration program on the Coosa Deposit, Westwater intends to complete a technical report in accordance with subpart 229.1300 of Regulation S-K – Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Mining Operations (“S-K 1300”). The new S-K 1300 requirements of the SEC are similar to NI 43-101, but not identical. The results of the technical report are expected by the end of 2022.
Mining Method
The Coosa Deposit is expected to be mined by conventional small-scale open-pit mining methods.
Concentrate Plant
Mineralized material from the Coosa Deposit is projected to have an average grade of 3.2% Cg, and is expected to contain impurities consisting of quartz, muscovite, iron oxides and calcite. Most of the impurities are present on the surfaces of the graphite flakes and can be easily removed during a metallurgical process known as flotation. Flotation processing maximizes the removal of these impurities while avoiding degradation of graphite flakes.
Further development work at the Coosa Deposit is expected to result in the design and a construction of a milling and concentration plant.
Products and Business Development
The Company is working to develop products for potential major battery markets. Based on discussions with potential customers, Westwater will focus on the production of ULTRA-CSPG™ and SPG fines during Phase I of the Coosa Plant and expects to evaluate the production of additional products in Phase II, subject to market demand and customer interest. 
The Company plans to focus on several different battery manufacturers, including lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, alkaline batteries, and primary-lithium batteries. The Company has initiated discussions with several battery manufacturers (including automobile manufacturers), with the goal of executing multi-year supply agreements. To date, the Company has executed Non-Disclosure Agreements with potential customers and placed test samples with certain potential customers. On November 17, 2021, the Company announced that it signed a letter of intent to sell 125-250 metric tons of ULTRA-CSPG™ for lithium-ion batteries in 2023 with an option to sell an additional 16,000 metric tons in 2025. This letter of intent is subject to the commissioning and operation of a pilot plant and a full-scale plant by the counter-party, the Company meeting certain quality and packaging specifications, and customary conditions.

Regulation
Graphite extraction and processing is regulated by the federal and state governments. Compliance with such regulations has a material effect on the economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been, and are expected to relate to, obtaining licenses and operating permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities, as well as the cost for maintaining compliance with licenses and permits once they have been issued. The current environmental and technical regulatory requirements for the graphite extraction and processing industry are well established. However, the regulatory process can make permitting difficult and timing unpredictable.
U.S. regulations pertaining to graphite extraction and processing may evolve in the U.S. However, at this time we do not anticipate any adverse impact from these regulations that would be unique to our operations.
Coosa Deposit
Graphite mining and processing in Alabama requires various permits, including those for any emissions to air, water, or other aspects of the environment. Permits may be required from the State of Alabama, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other State and Federal Agencies as identified in the Company’s DFS. Specifically for the mine, permits may be required in accordance with the Alabama Surface Mining Act of 1969, which is administrated by the Alabama Department of Labor (“DoL”). DoL issues mining permits, ensures that mine sites are properly bonded for reclamation purposes, and makes periodic inspections. The Company is currently in the process of determining the requirements for posting surety or negotiable bonds related to the area to be disturbed. Future mining operations at the Coosa Deposit may be subject to the US National Environmental Policy Act process, with potential review by various federal agencies that may include US Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corp of Engineers, and others.
In Alabama, any surface or groundwater withdrawals are managed through the Alabama Water Use Reporting Program. The Alabama Water Resources Act and associated regulations establish the requirements for water withdrawals. The process begins with the submittal of an application form called a “Declaration of Beneficial Use” and other required information to the Office of Water Resources (“OWR”) within the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. Once application information is reviewed and determined to be complete, OWR will issue a Certificate of Use (“COU”) that lists the applicant’s name and information concerning all registered surface and/or groundwater withdrawal points and their withdrawal information. Entities with a capacity to withdraw more than 100,000 gallons per day are required to register with OWR and obtain a COU. The COU certifies that proposed water use will not interfere with an existing water use and is beneficial.
Coosa Plant
For construction and operations of the Coosa Plant, the Company is required to obtain permits related to air emissions, water discharge, storm water drainage, and possibly other regulated waste. On January 31, 2022, Westwater announced that it has received its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) construction stormwater permit, which is required to commence site grading for the Coosa Plant. The NPDES permit has been issued by the State of Alabama under NPDES to ensure Westwater’s construction efforts comply with the Federal Clean Water Act as it relates to regulated disturbances and any stormwater runoff from the Coosa Plant site. The NDPES permit, when coupled with the Company’s best Management Practices, allows Westwater to commence site grading activities at the Coosa Plant.  
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we submitted our air emission permit application for a synthetic minor source operating permit to Alabama Department of Environmental Management (“ADEM”). The minor source air emission permit will allow the Company to begin vertical construction at the Coosa Plant site, and operate in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act. The Company expects ADEM to complete its review and issue the air emissions permit during the first half of 2022.

15



The Company is also required to obtain a Surface Indirect Discharge permit, which will allow the Company to utilize the municipal water treatment facility for wastewater discharges from the Coosa Plant. This permit is expected to be applied for and received in 2022.

● | Conservative promises well kept
--+--------------------------------

The Company works to be a good corporate citizen and to safeguard our employees, operations, neighbors and local communities where our employees and stakeholders live and work.
As these core values apply to our daily work, ESG criteria are applied to our decisions and actions. Further, Westwater intends to report its sustainability in accordance with the applicable guidelines established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”). The SASB is an independent, private sector standards-setting organization dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of the capital markets by fostering high-quality disclosure of material sustainability information. 
Environmental Criteria and Actions
The DFS for Phase I of the Coosa Plant was completed in October 2021. As part of the DFS, we have defined the raw material inputs, energy inputs, product streams, and waste streams, including air, water, solids and heat, for processing our graphite into battery products. Integrated into these input and output streams, we are defining methods of minimizing impacts to our environment, including:

● | Assessing the origin of our graphite and its impact to the environment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing the supply chain for reagents and their impact to the environment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing the energy forecasted for use in the manufacturing of our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performing trade off studies for recycling our reagents and waste streams to ensure we have minimized our impact to the communities where we work and where we source our input materials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greenhouse gas emissions: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work. Operations for Phase I of the Coosa Plant are expected to begin during the first half of 2023. At that time, Westwater will begin monitoring, measuring, and continuous improvement efforts related to its greenhouse gas emissions. 
Air quality: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work. 
Energy consumption: Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work.

Wastewater management: We expect that the Coosa Plant will not have surface water connections to waters of the United States, nor are there any such jurisdictional waters of the United States at the Coosa Plant. Westwater plans to pretreat the wastewater from the Coosa Plant through recycling, neutralizing and filtering to ensure it meets local wastewater disposal requirements. Estimates are being quantified and are expected to be finalized through detailed design work.
Social Criteria and Actions
Westwater has a strong history in social license. The Company has spent the last eight years providing scholarships to family members of the Cebolleta and Juan Tafoya Land Grants in New Mexico. We have supported this scholarship effort over the years to ensure that young people are afforded an opportunity to attend colleges and universities. As a result of this work, students in Veterinary Medicine, Mining Engineering, Nursing, Pharmacology, Criminal Justice and Business Management have been able to further their education.
As part of our Coosa Project design and analysis we are evaluating community needs, with input from the local stakeholders, and our ability to satisfy them – whether in education, infrastructure, or in other ways applicable to community needs. Through the Alabama Industrial Training (“AIDT”) program, the Company is eligible to receive a cash reimbursement for the design of a customized training plan and process for recruitment, screening, and training new employees. In addition to the cash reimbursement for training, AIDT offers in-kind services, which includes items such as assistance with a pre-employment selection system, maintenance assessments, safety assistance and training, and robotic and programable logic controller automation training. We seek to understand and minimize negative impacts to all of our stakeholders. During 2021, Westwater has held a number of “townhall” meetings with the local community in Coosa County, Alabama, to maintain open and transparent communication as well as to hear and address any concerns of the community. Westwater team members also hold memberships in the Coosa Riverkeepers and the Lake Martin Watch community group.
Westwater Team and Culture (Human Capital)
Our team and culture are keys to our success. Management aims to foster a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture. We believe that a diverse workforce provides different viewpoints on business strategy, risk and innovation. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. Our team is defined by a commitment to our mission, vision, and values, which includes providing a great place to work for teammates, being a good neighbor in the communities where we work and live, and being a good steward for our investors.
Westwater’s Board of Directors and management team has focused on hiring, succession planning and talent development to produce a strong and stable team. To that end, after a comprehensive search process that yielded many highly qualified candidates, Westwater hired Chad M. Potter as Westwater’s Chief Operating Officer on August 2, 2021. On February 7, 2022, following the announced retirement of Christopher M. Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Board of Directors elected Mr. Potter President and Chief Executive Officer effective February 26, 2022. Mr. Potter is a proven operations leader, whose unique skills and experience will be instrumental in leading Westwater and its subsidiaries through the construction, development, and future operation the Coosa Project. The addition of Mr. Potter will help position Westwater’s American-made battery graphite operations as best in class with a focus on safety, quality, integrity, and the protection of our environment.
Further, on May 10, 2021, after completing a comprehensive search process, Westwater hired Steven M. Cates as Westwater’s Chief Accounting Officer and Controller. Mr. Cates is a proven financial manager whose skills and experience will be instrumental in this stage of anticipated growth and value creation at Westwater. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 15 people were employed at Westwater. 
Consistent with our core value of safety for each other, Westwater offers employment benefits including medical insurance, paid time off, sick leave, retirement plans for all teammates, and a bonus structure at all salaried levels of the organization. Additionally, we have a history of supporting the professional development of members of our workforce

including financial support to those wishing to obtain advance degrees, and leadership seminars and training. We have, to date, provided key financial support that resulted in college degrees for three of our employees, or about 10% of our workforce.
Governance Criteria and Factors
Board of Directors
The Company’s business and affairs are overseen by the Board pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (the “Bylaws”). Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company’s business through discussions with the President and Chief Executive Officer and key members of management, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in Board and Committee meetings. All members of the Board are elected annually by the stockholders.
Regular attendance at Board meetings and the Annual Meeting is expected of each director. Our Board held 15 meetings during 2021. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of Board and applicable Committee meetings (held during the period that such director served) in 2021. The independent directors met in executive session at several of the Board meetings held in 2021. All of the directors at the time attended the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Board Leadership Structure
The Company’s governing documents allow the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals. This approach allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be separate or combined based upon the Company’s needs and the Board’s assessment of the Company’s leadership from time to time. Currently, Mr. Cryan serves as Chairman and Mr. Jones serves as Chief Executive Officer. Effective February 26, 2022, Mr. Cryan will become Executive Chairman of the Company.
Safety and Sustainability Committee (previously the Health, Safety, and Environmental Committee)
We have methods in place to ensure we do our job to integrate and govern ESG work in our business. We have a Safety and Sustainability Committee reporting directly to the entire Board of Directors of Westwater. The Safety and Sustainability Committee held one meeting in 2021. On May 21, 2021, the former Health, Safety and Environmental Committee was renamed by the Board as the Safety and Sustainability Committee, and a new charter was adopted that reads, in part:
The Committee’s primary purposes are to:

● | provide advice, counsel and recommendations to management on:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


o | health, safety, loss prevention issues and operational security, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


o | issues relating to sustainable development, environmental management and affairs, community relations, human rights, government relations and communications; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assist the Board in its oversight of:
--+--------------------------------------


o | health, safety, loss prevention and operational security issues relating to the Company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o | the Company’s compliance with regulations and policies that provide processes, procedures and standards to follow in accomplishing the Corporation’s goals and objectives relating to:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | health, safety, loss prevention issues and operational security ,and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


◾ | sustainable development, environmental management affairs, community relations, human rights, government relations and communications issues; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | management of risk related thereto.
--+------------------------------------

We have direct experience in managing ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems (“EMS”). These systems are designed to provide for reliable performance in sustainable management of businesses. We are committed to the continual improvement of the EMS, according to compliance obligations, by following the principles and requirement of ISO 14001. After the completion of our Phase I DFS, management has designed ISO 14001 based management systems to facilitate and govern our environmental performance. This effort includes the establishment of a preliminary set of metrics for measuring that performance.
Audit Committee
We have a separately-designated Audit Committee composed solely of independent directors. The Audit Committee held four meetings in 2021.
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to:

● | assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities with respect to the accounting policies, internal controls and financial reporting of the Company;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, standards and ethical business conduct, and the systems of internal controls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assist the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the registered public accounting firm engaged to be the independent auditor of the Company; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prepare the Audit Committee report required to be included in the Company’s proxy statements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee held five meetings in 2021. The Compensation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in setting the compensation of the Company’s directors and executive officers and administering and implementing the Company’s incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. See Item 11. Executive Compensation in this annual report for further discussion of the Compensation Committee’s roles and responsibilities as well as the Company’s compensation philosophy.

Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting during 2021, and its duties and responsibilities are to:

● | recommend to the Board director nominees for the annual meeting of stockholders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | identify and recommend candidates to fill vacancies occurring between annual stockholder meetings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | oversee all aspects of corporate governance of the Company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

19



The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board identifies director candidates based on input provided by a number of sources, including members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, other directors, our stockholders, members of management and third parties. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not distinguish between nominees recommended by our stockholders and those recommended by other parties. Any stockholder recommendation must be sent to the Secretary of Westwater Resources, Inc. at 6950 S. Potomac Street, Suite 300, Centennial, Colorado 80112, and must include detailed background information regarding the suggested candidate that demonstrates how the individual meets the Board membership criteria discussed below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to consult with or retain advisors or search firms to assist in the identification of qualified director candidates.
As part of the identification process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account each candidate’s business and professional skills, experience serving in management or on the board of directors of companies similar to the Company, financial literacy, independence, personal integrity and judgment. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will, in connection with its assessment and recommendation of candidates for director, consider diversity (including, but not limited to, gender, race, ethnicity, age, experience and skills) and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the then-current and anticipated future needs of the Board and the Company, and to maintain a balance of perspectives, qualifications, qualities and skills on the Board. The Board does not have a formal diversity policy for directors. However, the Board is committed to an inclusive membership. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek candidates that have different qualities and experiences at different times in order to maximize the aggregate experience, qualities and strengths of the Board members, nominees for each election or appointment of directors will be evaluated using a substantially similar process. Incumbent directors who are being considered for re-nomination are re-evaluated both on their performance as directors and their continued ability to meet the required qualifications.
Board Diversity
Westwater’s Board of Directors is comprised of four independent directors, and currently has a 50/50 gender representation of the independent directors. In 2021, Westwater was acknowledged by, and received an award, from BoardConnect by the Women’s Leadership foundation for achieving gender balance on its Board of Directors. Westwater is currently one of only eight public companies in Colorado to have achieved this balance.
Covid-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on Westwater’s corporate business activities. Prior to March 1, 2021, Westwater reduced utilization of its offices and instituted remote working arrangements to ensure that some employees were able to work remotely using systems that already were in place. On March 1, 2021, Westwater reopened its Centennial corporate facility and allowed employees to return to the office to work together with appropriate health protocols in place. Westwater’s continued focus on the health and safety of employees, the safety of operations, and the safety of the communities in which our employees live and work remains paramount. To that end, Westwater has continued to restrict unnecessary travel, and ensured that employees are permitted to take time off due to illness or the illness of those around them without penalty.
