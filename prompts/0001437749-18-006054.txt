ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
BIO-key International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company,” “BIO-key,” “we,” or “us), was founded in 1993 to develop and market advanced fingerprint biometric technology and related security software solutions. First incorporated as BBG Engineering, the company was renamed SAC Technologies in 1994 and renamed BIO-key International, Inc. in 2002.
 
We develop and market advanced fingerprint biometric identification and identity verification technologies, as well as related identity management and credentialing hardware and software solutions. We were pioneers in developing automated, finger identification technology that supplements or compliments other methods of identification and verification, such as personal inspection identification, passwords, tokens, smart cards, ID cards, PKI, credit card, passports, driver’s licenses, OTP or other form of possession or knowledge-based credentialing. Additionally, advanced BIO-key® technology has been, and is, used to improve both the accuracy and speed of competing finger-based biometrics.
 
We have developed what we believe is the most discriminating and effective commercially available finger-based biometric technology. Our primary focus is in marketing and selling this technology into commercial logical and physical privilege entitlement and access control markets. Our primary market focus includes enterprise security, mobile payments and credentialing, healthcare records and data security, among other things. Our secondary focus includes government markets, large scale identity projects such as voter’s registration, driver’s license, national ID programs, and SIM card registration.
 
In 2015, we entered into the fingerprint hardware device business through a strategic relationship with China Goldjoy Group (“CGG”), an entity that is affiliated with one of our directors. We market and sell through distributors and directly to end users via Amazon, our SideSwipe™, EcoID™ and SideTouch™ finger readers which can be used on any laptop, tablet or other device which contains a USB port. We also market and sell a variety of biometric and Bluetooth enabled padlocks, luggage locks, and bicycle locks.
  
We continue to develop advancements in our capabilities, as well as explore potential strategic relationships, including business combinations and acquisitions, which could help us leverage our capability to deliver our solutions. We have built a direct sales force, and also utilize distributors, resellers, integrators and partners with substantial experience in selling technology solutions to government and corporate customers in their respective markets.

Finger-based Biometric Identification and Personal Identity Verification
 
We are a leader in finger-based biometric identification and personal identity verification, as well as authentication-transaction security. Stand-alone, or in partnerships with OEMs, integrators, and solution providers, we provide biometric security solutions to private and public sector customers. We help customers reduce risk by providing the ability to control access to facilities and services, in either the logical or physical domain. Our solutions positively identify individuals and verify, or confirm, their identity before granting access to, among other things, corporate resources, subscribed data and services, web portals, applications, physical locations or assets. 
 
We also develop and distribute hardware components that are used in conjunction with our software, and sell third-party hardware components with our software in various configurations required by our customers. Our products are interoperable with all major fingerprint reader and hardware manufacturers, enabling application developers, value added resellers (“VARs”), and channel partners to integrate our fingerprint biometrics into their applications, while dramatically reducing maintenance, upgrade and life-cycle costs. Our core technology supports interoperability on over 40 different commercially available fingerprint readers and is interoperable across Windows, Linux, and the Android mobile operating systems. This interoperability is unique in the industry, is a key differentiator for our products in the biometric market and, in our opinion, makes our technology more viable than competing technologies and expands the size of the overall market for our products.
 
In November 2015, we entered into a license agreement with CGG pursuant to which we obtained a license to certain software from CGG, known as FingerQ, which has been integrated into our core WEB-key® platform and can be used in a number of application areas, including mobile payments and personal identity devices for the Asia Pacific markets. In 2016, the software has been integrated into our line of finger scanners that are marketed to consumers and enterprise users worldwide.

Markets
 
Identity Management, User Authentication, Privilege Entitlement and Access Control
 
Our products reduce risk of theft, fraud, loss and attack by limiting access to valuable assets, privileges, data, services, networks and places, to only authorized individuals. Conversely, our products enhance the monetary value and/or viability of privileged assets, places and services by ensuring only subscribers and otherwise entitled holders can enjoy full access to their privileges. In effect, our products replace traditional credentialing systems, which utilize a physical or electronic credential document to represent the holder’s privilege entitlement, and access control systems that guard access to such privileges. Examples of such privileges include, but are not limited to: international travel and immigration privileges; employment ID, campus ID and corporate ID privileges; healthcare service privileges; citizen entitlement privileges such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security; and bank, credit account and financial transaction privileges such as checking accounts, debit and credit cards, payments, online services and subscription privileges. Examples of access points include doorways, gates, computers, point-of-sale terminals, smart-phones or web-portals and automobiles. In our opinion, the market for advanced user authentication, including fingerprint biometrics, is conceptually enormous, represented by virtually any doorway, gate, computer network or internet end-point like smart-phones, desktops, laptops PCs and tablets, and compounded by the number of individuals privileged to access something guarded by those access points. We believe the market opportunity for our products is massive, global and growing encompassing nearly all privilege entitlement and access control systems.

Historically, our largest market has been access control within highly regulated industries like healthcare. However, we believe the mass adoption of advanced smart-phone and hand-held wireless devices have caused commercial demand for advanced user authentication to emerge as viable. The introduction of smart-phone capabilities, like mobile payments and credentialing, could effectively require biometric user authentication on mobile devices to reduce risks of identity theft, payment fraud and other forms of fraud in the mobile or cellular based World Wide Web. As more services and payment functionalities, like mobile wallets and NFC, migrate to smart-phones, the value and potential risk associated with such systems should grow substantially and drive demand and mass adoption of advanced user authentication technologies, including fingerprint biometrics and our solutions. 
 
Upon introducing a series of compact fingerprint readers, we saw an immediate increase in inquiries from both large commercial companies seeking an alternative to passwords, and from consumers recognizing that they could use SideSwipe or EcoID to replace their Windows password. 
 
In October 2015, we established BIO-key Hong Kong for purposes of establishing relationships and conducting business is the Asia Pacific Region. Through our Hong Kong subsidiary, we support the growing demand for secure identification and authentication in the region.
 
We believe there is potential for significant market growth in the following key areas:
 

● | Corporate network access control, corporate campuses, computer networks, and applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer mobile credentialing, including mobile payments, credit and payment card programs, data and application access, and commercial loyalty programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demand for BIO-key hardware products from Windows 10 users and Fortune 500 companies.

● | Growth in the Asia Pacific region.
--+-----------------------------------


● | Biometric based consumer products.
--+-----------------------------------

Business Model
 
Our business model for 2018 and beyond is focused on the following key areas:
 

Market Drivers | The primary drivers for fingerprint authentication are identity theft, data breaches, and compliance in highly regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare. However, the number one driver might be the world’s dissatisfaction with passwords. Introduced as a way to offer a personal layer of security when the Internet was first launched, and long before the term “hacker” was coined, the password was a great solution to protect access to email accounts and basic internet activities. Yet, none of us could envision that the internet and smart mobile devices would expose us to a new boundary-less world, one that would require a much better understanding of cybersecurity.
----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Education has been an important factor in the growth of the biometric industry. Expanded utilization provides use cases and helps increase awareness. Even as myths about the technology are discussed, eventually, industry leaders educate the public about the facts versus fiction. BIO-key has taken a keen focus on championing biometric technology across all verticals and is viewed as a thought leader in the space. We have been featured in the national media and participate in national and international trade conferences commenting on key topics and issues within the industry
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


OEM Customers | We will continue to prioritize securing agreements with OEM customers. The history of success supporting NCR, McKesson and LexisNexis provides an established footprint that we intend to build upon. As OEM customers embed BIO-key solutions within their products, the customer benefits from the enhanced security and workflow. OEM customers ordering patterns are more predictable and OEM customers generally require lower service and support resourcing.
--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Highly Regulated Industries | Government projects and healthcare, including hospitals, clinics, private practices and blood centers provide a significant opportunity for BIO-key. In healthcare, we anticipate that patient identification will emerge as a highly regulated requirement for all healthcare organizations and we are developing our software to accommodate this need. The financial services industry in the U.S. has been slow to adopt biometric authentication while Asia and Europe have been more receptive to incorporating biometrics. We anticipate that the U.S. market will grow rapidly once the first major institution adopts a biometric solution.
-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Partner Model | We remain committed to a partner sales model. In the Identity and Access Management (IAM) space, we have adjusted our targets to include working with resellers, and are developing a security assertion markup language (SAML) solution for ease of installation purposes. In healthcare, HealthCast and other partners, such as Caradigm and Aventura, identified and sold our solutions to a number of new customers in 2016.
---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Consumer Market | We are working with Amazon and developing packaging so that our compact fingerprint readers can be featured and sold through retail outlets directly to consumers. This channel has been very successful and continues to grow for us.
-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Microsoft Partnership | In November of 2015, we established a partnership with Microsoft initiated by our participation at the “Ignite your Business” Windows 10 – Hello twelve city launch tour. BIO-key was featured as the exclusive biometric technology vendor during the launch and we continue to leverage this unique status.
-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hardware | Almost immediately after launching SideSwipe, we witnessed an increase in inquiries inspiring us to develop a series of compact readers with different features and form factors. Hardware has played a significant role in increasing the visibility of our company and has become a catalyst for our software. By offering hardware to customers, we offer a more full and complete solution and eliminate the need for us to engage a hardware vendor on certain projects, which can sometimes inhibit the process and margins. In 2017, we expanded our offerings to include Bluetooth and biometric enabled padlocks, TSA approved luggage locks, and bicycle locks. These products have been well received by consumers and are currently selling in both Asia Pacific and U.S. markets. We are continuing to develop new products and grow our base of distributors and retail outlets for our products.

We have also licensed mobile platform software from CGG which we have integrated with our core WEB-key offerings and introduced to the Asian markets in 2016. This presents a significant opportunity for us going forward. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we spent $1,659,875 and $2,008,942, respectively, on research and development.
 
Products On Demand (POD)
 
Our technology and development team welcomes the opportunity to develop customer specific solutions if they are funded. Our strategy to support POD is to utilize internal resources, outsource support services and strategic partners to satisfy unique customer requirements. Our flexible, nimble business model and interoperable capabilities are key differentiators. 
Competition
 
In addition to companies that provide existing commonplace methods of restricting access to facilities and logical access points such as pass cards, PIN numbers, passwords, locks and keys, there are numerous companies involved in the development, manufacturing and marketing of fingerprint biometrics products to commercial, government, law enforcement and prison markets. These companies include, but are not limited to, 3M (Cogent), NEC, and MorphoTrak.
 
The majority of sales for automated fingerprint identification products in the market to date have been deployed for government agencies, healthcare facilities, and law enforcement applications. The consumer and commercial markets represent areas of significant growth potential for biometrics, led by the use of mobile devices.

The epidemic of security and data breaches reported over the past few years is one of the driving factors for identifying new methods of protecting valuable data. After attempting to create a more sophisticated password or more efficient token or PIN, it has become apparent that each of these methods are easily compromised, and the downside risks are significant.
 
With respect to competing biometrics technologies, each has its strengths and weaknesses and none has emerged as a market leader:
 

● | Fingerprint identification is generally viewed as very accurate, inexpensive and non-intrusive and is the dominant biometric in use today and will be for the foreseeable future;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Palm Vein scanning is expensive, technique-sensitive, and offers mobility challenges;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Iris scanning is viewed as accurate, but the hardware is significantly more expensive; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Facial recognition can have accuracy limitations and is typically highly dependent on ambient lighting conditions, angle of view, and other factors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
