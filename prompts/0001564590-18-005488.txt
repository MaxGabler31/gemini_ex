Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Sientra, Inc. (“Sientra”, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a medical aesthetics company committed to making a difference in patients’ lives by enhancing their body image, growing their self‑esteem and restoring their confidence. We were founded to provide greater choices to board‑certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants and tissue expanders exclusively to board‑certified and board‑admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loyalty and confidence. We began selling BIOCORNEUM, an advanced silicone scar treatment directly to physicians after we acquired BIOCORNEUM from Enaltus LLC, or Enaltus, in March 2016.  Additionally, we began selling the AlloX2, and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, as well as the Softspan line of general tissue expanders, after we acquired these product lines from Specialty Surgical Products, Inc., or SSP, in November 2016.
 
On June 11, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with miraDry (formerly Miramar Labs), pursuant to which we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of miraDry’s common stock. Pursuant to the transaction, which closed on July 25, 2017 we added the miraDry System, the only FDA cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors to our aesthetics portfolio. Following our acquisition of miraDry in July 2017, we began selling the miraDry System and bioTips.  As a result of the miraDry acquisition, we determined that we will conduct our business in two operating segments: the Breast Products segment, which is comprised of our breast implants, tissue expanders and scar management products, and the miraDry segment, which is comprised of our recently acquired miraDry System.
 
The global market for aesthetic procedures is significant. The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, estimates that U.S. consumers spent approximately $15 billion on approximately ten million aesthetic procedures in 2016, including both surgical and non‑invasive cosmetic treatments.  Breast augmentation surgery remains the leading aesthetic surgical procedure by dollars and number of procedures in the United States. According to ASAPS, over 310,000 primary breast augmentation procedures were performed in the United States in 2016.  For breast reconstruction, American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS, estimates that approximately 109,000 procedures were performed in the United States in 2016.  According to the ASAPS, cosmetic procedures have increased by 35% over the past five years with nonsurgical procedures up 39%. We believe several factors are contributing to the ongoing growth in aesthetic procedures, including continuing focus on body image and appearance, broader availability of safe non-invasive aesthetic procedures, and increased physician focus on aesthetic procedures. 
 We sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2017, consisted of 83 employees, including 68 sales representatives and 15 sales managers.  Additionally, we also sell our miraDry System in several international markets where we leverage a combination of distributor relationships and direct sales efforts. As of December 31, 2017, our international operations were supported by 7 employees, including 6 sales representatives and 1 sales manager.
 We commenced sales of our breast implants in the United States in the second quarter of 2012. Our Breast Products segment net sales were $31.5 million, $20.7 million and $38.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We generate revenues from sales of our miraDry System and from the sales of bioTips which are required for use for each miraDry procedure performed. We generated net sales of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the acquisition date on July 25, 2017. With the acquisition of miraDry, we expect net sales, cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development expenses to increase in 2018 when compared to 2017 and prior periods. As of December 31, 2017, over 100,000 miraDry procedures have been sold worldwide.

Our Market
 The global market for aesthetic procedures is significant. The ASAPS estimates that U.S. consumers spent approximately $15 billion on approximately ten million aesthetic procedures in 2016, including both surgical and non‑invasive cosmetic treatments.
 Breast Products
 Breast augmentation surgery remains the leading aesthetic surgical procedure by dollars and number of procedures in the United States. According to ASAPS, over 310,000 primary breast augmentation procedures were performed in the United States in 2016. These procedures provide cosmetic solutions generally to enhance breast size and shape, correct breast asymmetries or help restore fullness after breastfeeding. For breast reconstruction, American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS, estimates that approximately 109,000 procedures were performed in the United States in 2016. These procedures are a surgical solution generally used to restore a breast to near normal shape and appearance following a mastectomy and typically utilize a breast tissue expander prior to implantation of a breast implant. Based on the number of procedures reported by ASAPS and by ASPS, and our estimates of average selling price, implant mix and implants per procedure, we estimate that the U.S. market for breast implants and breast tissue expanders exceeded $652 million in 2016. 
 We sell our breast implants and tissue expanders exclusively to board‑certified and board‑admissible plastic surgeons, as determined by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, who we refer to as Plastic Surgeons. These surgeons have completed the extensive multi‑year plastic surgery residency training required by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. While aesthetic procedures are performed by a wide range of medical professionals, including dermatologists, otolaryngologists, obstetricians, gynecologists, dentists and other specialists, the majority of aesthetic surgical procedures are performed by Plastic Surgeons. Plastic Surgeons are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. According to the American Board of Plastic Surgery, there are approximately 6,500 board‑certified plastic surgeons in the United States.
 miraDry
 
According to the ASAPS, cosmetic procedures have increased by 35% over the past five years with nonsurgical procedures up 39%. Laser and light-based hair removal continues to be the largest volume among non-invasive and non-injectable procedures. As an emerging market, energy-based procedures for sweat and odor reduction are not currently tracked by ASAPS data. No one treatment procedure is offered by all physicians, and treatments vary in terms of the treatment goal and desired effect. As a result, the total aesthetic market as reported by the ASAPS does not represent the market potential for miraDry or any other single product or treatment, but illustrates that each year patients elect to have millions of procedures to enhance their appearance. We believe several factors are contributing to the ongoing growth in aesthetic procedures, including:
 
 
• | Broader availability of safe non-invasive aesthetic procedures. Technological developments have resulted in the introduction of a broader range of safe, non-invasive aesthetic procedures. According to the ASAPS, non-invasive aesthetic treatments are growing faster than invasive surgical procedures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased physician focus on aesthetic procedures. We believe increased restrictions imposed by managed care and government agencies on reimbursement for medical treatments are motivating our customers to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices, which generally consist of procedures paid for directly by patients. We expect this trend to continue as our customers look for ways to expand their practices and improve profitability.

Hyperhidrosis is a medical condition of varying degree in which a person sweats excessively. The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is significant. A study published by Strutton et al. in the June 2004 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, or AAD, titled “US prevalence of hyperhidrosis and impact on individuals with axillary hyperhidrosis: Results from a national survey,” estimated that 2.8% of the general population has hyperhidrosis (in this study defined as excessive or abnormal sweating) with 50.8% thereof having axillary hyperhidrosis. Additionally, the general consensus of medical practitioners is that the definition of 
 4


hyperhidrosis includes anyone who is bothered by their sweat. As such, the definition of axillary hyperhidrosis is broad in scope and the condition depends upon whether patients have determined that their sweating is excessive or abnormal. Because this assessment is subjectively determined by the patients themselves, there is no quantifiable standard that medical practitioners use to determine whether a patient is suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis. If patients subjectively determine that their sweating is excessive and as such are bothered by their sweating, such patients are considered to be suffering from axillary hyperhidrosis.
 
In 2017, we commissioned a survey of over 2,000 consumers, evaluating several criteria including sweat bothered, dissatisfaction with current treatment, interest in a non-surgical long-term solution, and interest in the miraDry product description. Based on this survey, we believe the market for miraDry in the U.S. alone is approximately 37 million people.
 Our Opportunity
 Breast Products
 We believe a significant opportunity exists in the U.S. marketplace due to the high barriers to entry in the U.S. breast implant market and the historical lack of product and service innovation for Plastic Surgeons.
 For more than 20 years prior to the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012, only two companies manufactured and distributed breast implants in the United States. We believe that this market concentration is largely a result of the considerable costs and risks associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process required by the FDA, which has created a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. breast implant market. All new breast implants require PMA approval from the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. The PMA application process is lengthy and uncertain, and it must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires long‑term follow‑up of a large number of enrolled patients, as well as extensive pre‑clinical, clinical and other product data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. We believe that in the near term, it is likely that the companies currently providing silicone gel breast implants in the United States will continue to be the only companies servicing the U.S. silicone breast implant market.
 We believe the rigorous FDA approval process and the existence of only two competitors in the U.S. market have historically contributed to a lack of technological innovation in the U.S. breast implant industry resulting in limited product choices. Until the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012, surgeons in the United States were only able to purchase basic round breast implants from our two U.S. competitors, while surgeons outside of the United States were able to purchase technologically‑advanced round and anatomically‑shaped breast implants.
 miraDry
 The miraDry procedure addresses a large underpenetrated market in the non-invasive, lifestyle aesthetics category. The miraDry treatment is the first and only FDA cleared solution to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors with as little as one 60-minute treatment, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with surgical and minimally-invasive procedures.  The sweat glands in the treated area are destroyed through targeted heating of the tissue, and because the body does not regenerate sweat glands, we believe the results will be lasting, although some patients may need to repeat the miraDry procedure to achieve the lasting results. Due to these advantages, we believe that the miraDry treatment is appealing to a wide range of individuals seeking a lasting solution to underarm sweat.
 The miraDry System has been cleared by the FDA as indicated for use in the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, or a condition characterized by abnormal sweating in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature, plus unwanted underarm hair removal, and reduction of underarm hair. When used for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, the miraDry System may reduce underarm odor. In addition, the miraDry System received CE mark approval for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis and approval in several other countries. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America.

Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities afforded by current market dynamics. By focusing on products with technologically differentiated characteristics, demonstrating strong clinical data, offering more product choices and providing services tailored specifically to the needs of physicians, we believe we can enhance our position in the market. Our competitive strengths include:
 Proven and experienced leadership team.  We have a highly experienced management team at both the corporate and operational levels with significant experience in the medical aesthetics industry. Members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the medical aesthetics industry.
 Breast Products
 Differentiated silicone gel and texturing technologies.  We incorporate differentiated technologies into our proprietary breast implants to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, including our silicone shell, High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel and a textured surface. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the High-Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our products. In addition, the texturing on Sientra’s implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. 
 Strong clinical trial outcomes.  Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants. Our breast implants were approved by the FDA based on data we collected from our ongoing, long‑term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States. The clinical data we collected over a ten-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, based on our competitors’ published ten-year data.
 Innovative services that deliver an improved customer experience.  Our customer service offerings are intended to accommodate and anticipate the needs of our Plastic Surgeons so they can focus on providing better services to their patients. We provide an industry-leading ten‑year limited warranty that provides patients with a cash reimbursement for certain out‑of‑pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event; a lifetime no‑charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures; and our industry‑first C3 Program through which we offer no‑charge replacement implants to breast augmentation patients who experience capsular contracture within the first five years after implantation with our smooth or textured breast implants. We also offer specialized educational initiatives and a streamlined ordering, shipping and billing process.
 Board‑certified plastic surgeon focus.  We sell our breast implants and tissue expanders exclusively to board‑certified and board‑admissible plastic surgeons who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. We address the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons through continued product innovation, expansion of our product portfolio and enhanced customer service offerings. We believe that securing the loyalty and confidence of Plastic Surgeons is essential to our success and that our association with Plastic Surgeons enhances our credibility and aligns with our focus on making a difference in patients’ lives.
 miraDry
 Strong clinical trial outcomes.  The miraDry System is the only FDA cleared device to reduce underarm sweat, odor and hair of all colors. Clinical studies involving more than 150 patients demonstrate that one or two miraDry procedures can noticeably and measurably reduce the amount of sweat from the axilla, or underarm. In our study involving 120 subjects, 89% of patients that received treatment experienced reduction in their sweat with no reported deaths, injuries requiring immediate medical attention to prevent death, or permanent impairment. In a second study involving 31 patients, patients reported an average of 82% sweat reduction at 12 months and 100% of patients reported as being no longer bothered by their hyperhidrosis at 24 months. Because sweat glands do not regenerate after the procedure, we believe the results are lasting.
 Patient satisfaction. miraDry allows most patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive procedures for sweat, odor and 
 6


hair reduction. In addition, unlike many other non-invasive procedures, patients are not required to undergo multiple treatment procedures to obtain aesthetic results. According to RealSelf.com, as of January 16, 2018, the leading online community helping people make confident choices in elective cosmetic procedures, the miraDry procedure received a 90% “worth it” rating of the participating patients.
 
Reproducible results. The miraDry procedure requires limited training and skill to obtain successful aesthetic results. The miraDry System was designed to be easy to operate and largely automated, resulting in a more consistent application and reproducible results.
 
Differentiated, high-value product for physician practices. Our selective distribution strategy was designed to enable our customers to market miraDry as a highly differentiated, non-invasive sweat, odor, and hair reduction procedure. Based on our commercial data and customer experiences, we have seen attractive economic benefits for our customers.
 Our Strategy
 Our objective is to become a leading global provider of differentiated medical aesthetic products and services tailored to meet the needs of physicians, allowing us to deliver on our commitment to enhance and make a difference in patients’ lives. To achieve our objective, we are pursuing the following business strategies:
 Create awareness of our differentiated technologies, products and services with Plastic Surgeons and consumers.  Since we commenced commercial operations, we have focused most of our marketing efforts on Plastic Surgeons to promote and create awareness of the benefits of our products. Among other marketing programs targeted at Plastic Surgeons, we offer educational initiatives exclusively to Plastic Surgeons through our Sientra Education Forums, and we have continued our consumer-directed efforts, including an exclusive collaboration with RealSelf.com.  We believe that continuing to invest in expanding marketing initiatives will have a positive impact on our business.
 Selectively pursue acquisitions and expand into new markets.  We may continue to selectively pursue domestic and international acquisitions of businesses or technologies that may allow us to leverage our relationships with Plastic Surgeons and our existing commercial infrastructure to provide us with new or complementary products or technologies, and allow us to compete in new geographic markets or market segments or to increase our market share. For example, we began selling BIOCORNEUM directly to physicians after we acquired BIOCORNEUM from Enaltus in March 2016. We began selling the AlloX2 and Dermaspan lines of breast tissue expanders, and the Softspan line of general tissue expanders, after we acquired these product lines from SSP in November 2016. We began selling the miraDry System and bioTips after the acquisition in July 2017.
 Broaden our product portfolio and launch new products and services.  We plan to continue to develop products that address the unmet needs of physicians and patients by leveraging our innovative technologies in combination with our regulatory and product development expertise. We have a number of new breast implants and tissue expanders under development with different characteristics and configurations. We believe these expanded product choices will allow Plastic Surgeons to potentially achieve better outcomes for their patients.
 Highly optimized, experienced and fully trained sales force. We maintain separate North American sales forces within our Breast Products and miraDry segments.  Our Breast Products sales force primarily consists of Plastic Surgery Consultants, or PSCs, focused on selling all breast products exclusively to board‑certified and board‑admissible plastic surgeons. Additionally, our Breast Products segment is also supported by Multi Specialty Consultants, or MSCs, that sell scar management products directly to physicians. Our miraDry sales force is a bifurcated organization that has produced stronger focus and results on system sales and high-margin consumable sales. This organization is split between Area Sales Managers, or ASMs, who focus on system sales, and Practice Development Managers, or PDMs, who focus on high margin consumable sales, assisting practices to market miraDry to patients, product training and driving system utilization. We have continued to hire high quality, experienced sales representatives and sales management personnel in all categories and train the sales organization to optimize performance in their respective roles. We believe our sales force will continue to generate increased customer adoption and patient awareness momentum in the marketplace.
7


Invest in clinical studies and peer reviewed articles with key opinion leaders.  We intend to continue to invest in clinical studies in order to provide published peer reviewed articles that support the clinical benefits of our products and technologies over those of our competitors. We believe our relationship with Plastic Surgeons and our continued focus on providing differentiated products and services will allow us to leverage our existing capabilities to increase our share of the breast implant market specifically and the medical aesthetics market generally.
 
Increase our international presence. There is strong global demand for aesthetic procedures outside of North America. We intend to increase our market penetration outside of North America and build global brand recognition. We have received regulatory approval or are otherwise free to market miraDry in numerous international markets.  We intend to seek regulatory approval to market miraDry in additional international markets, as well as grow our international sales and marketing organization to focus on increasing sales and strengthening our customer relationships. As part of this strategy, we are and intend to continue to opportunistically deploy a direct sales force in select international markets.
 Our Products
 Our portfolio of products has been specifically tailored to meet the needs of the physicians we serve. We believe that our broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics enable physicians to deliver better outcomes for their patients.
Breast Products
 Our primary breast products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in approximately 400 variations of shapes, sizes, fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective procedures that are generally performed on a cash‑pay basis. Many of our proprietary breast implants incorporate one or more technologies that differentiate us from our competitors, including a High‑Strength Cohesive, or HSC, silicone gel and shell texturing. Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the integration of our silicone implant shell and High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our implants. The texturing on Sientra’s implant shell is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. 
Breast Augmentation and Breast Reconstruction Products
 Breast Implants.  We offer the following breast implants:
  
• | Anatomically‑shaped textured. A full line of textured, anatomically‑shaped HSC+ breast implants, all of which incorporate our High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel and a textured surface. Our anatomically‑shaped implants are engineered for shape retention and feature a gradual upper‑pole slope and distributed volume that mimics the characteristics of a natural breast. They also provide a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness and are designed to enhance tissue adherence to reduce malposition and capsular contracture. Due to the unique relationship between our implant gel and our implant shells, our anatomically‑shaped implants have enhanced ability to retain their shape without sacrificing the desired softness. We offer these anatomically‑shaped implants in three base configurations: Round Base, Classic Base and Oval Base. Our Round Base implants are available in one projection profile and eight volumes, our Classic Base implants are available in one projection profile and eight volumes and our Oval Base implants are available in three projection profiles and 25 volumes.

Our breast tissue expanders are temporary devices used in breast reconstruction and implanted during or after the completion of a mastectomy and intended to aid in the process of recreating tissue coverage to allow for the placement of the final implant to reconstruct the breast.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scar Management Products
 We offer BIOCORNEUM, the only advanced scar treatment with a patented crosslinking silicone technology, Silishield, plus the protection of SPF 30. BIOCORNEUM acts as a quick drying, silicone gel that creates an invisible, breathable and flexible silicone sheet over scars. It is a silicone scar treatment, supported by clinical data, that prevents and minimizes the formation of hypertrophic and keloid scars, decreases the appearance of old scars, and helps to restore the function of healthy skin. The SPF 30 provides protection from sun exposure’s darkening effects. The patented gel helps to safeguard against chemical, microbial, and physical detriments while improving the cosmetic appearance of scar tissue by binding with the stratum corneum (the outer layer of skin cells). BIOCORNEUM decreases transepidermal water loss and increases the production of fibroblast growth factor to heal skin and prevent abnormal scarring. 
Other Products
 We also offer a range of other aesthetic products that have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, including:
  
• | temporary, single‑use, saline‑filled breast implant sizers that can be used to help identify the correct style and size implant for an individual patient; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Softspan non‑breast tissue expanders, which are temporary devices intended to aid in the process of expanding tissue and skin surface area for burn care and other reconstructive use.

 miraDry
 The miraDry Experience
 The miraDry System provides patients with a precise and non-invasive and durable procedure to selectively destroy underarm sweat glands for both severely hyperhidrotic patients and those that are bothered by their underarm sweat.  The miraDry System is clinically proven to reduce sweat in one or more procedures of approximately one hour, allowing most patients to achieve immediately noticeable and durable results without the pain, expense, downtime, or repeat visits associated with surgical and minimally-invasive procedures. The first step of the miraDry process is a patient consultation. We train our physician customers to properly explain to their patients the results they should expect from a miraDry procedure. The patient’s underarm is anesthetized for maximum comfort. Then the underarm is sized using a sizing template and an appropriately sized temporary treatment grid is then selected and applied to the underarm to guide treatment. The miraDry handpiece is applied step-by-step using the grid markings as guides to treat the entire axilla. During each application of microwave energy, the skin is first cooled, energy is applied, and then more cooling is applied to the skin’s surface providing constant temperature control of the tissue for the patient’s comfort. Following treatment, the patient is given post-treatment instructions.
 9


Our surveys indicate that most patients find the miraDry procedure easy to tolerate. Due to the underarm being fully anesthetized prior to treatment, patients typically only report feeling a tugging sensation from the suction created when the handpiece is placed on the treatment area but otherwise report no sensation.
 Launch of New Protocol and Software Upgrade: miraDry Fresh
 On February 16, 2018, the company launched “miraDry Fresh”, a new and improved treatment protocol for the miraDry System.  The miraDry fresh protocol and software upgrade reduces overall procedure time by up to 35% and includes a revision to the anesthesia process resulting in a treatment that can be administered with greater ease and is more delegateable. 
 miraDry System
 The miraDry System consists of the miraDry console and the miraDry handpiece. The miraDry console contains a simple user interface with touchscreen software, power management and control functions, and a chiller unit that is responsible for the hydro-ceramic constant cooling. Our miraDry System also contains software that tracks and collects data on each procedure performed and any error messages that may be generated during the procedure. We collect and analyze this information to help physicians better understand their usage patterns and improve their marketing plans, utilization, and profitability.
 
 
• | The color touch screen on the miraDry console provides operators with clear step-by-step visual instructions that guide the user through a miraDry procedure, providing continuous status updates and easy to follow notifications or corrective actions in the rare event of a procedure interruption.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The miraDry handpiece is used to apply the microwave energy while maintaining constant contact cooling of the skin during treatment. The handpiece also displays the heating and cooling cycles during each pulse. The handpiece is detachable to enable future product upgrades.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The unit is mobile, allowing a physician to easily transfer the miraDry System between treatment rooms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vents are built into the miraDry System control unit to provide airflow and reduce heat build-up. Our miraDry System can be used in a standard physician treatment room without any special ventilation requirements or room modifications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 miraDry single-use bioTips
 
Our miraDry bioTips facilitate the proper suctioning of the skin to maintain constant contact of the skin with the handpiece during the treatment. Also, the bioTips facilitate the pay-per-procedure feature of our miraDry System. Our bioTips are typically shipped with branded gel packs for patients to apply after treatment.
 Our proprietary consumable, the bioTip, is designed such that each bioTip is encoded to be used only with our proprietary system and expires within a set time and cannot be reused. Each bioTip is preprogrammed with enabling software that permits the miraDry System to perform a single patient treatment for a fixed duration of time and an encrypted security certificate that prevents the performance of a miraDry procedure unless the bioTip is recognized and authenticated by the specific miraDry System. The security certificate is designed to ensure that physicians pay for each patient treated and prevent the use of counterfeit bioTips.
 Our Technology
 Breast Products
 Our current portfolio of breast implants utilizes what we believe are the most advanced technologies currently available on the market. These technologies are supported by rigorous product testing, analytics and clinical data. The advanced technologies in our products include:
 10


High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel.  Our HSC and HSC+ breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel used in our products. The use of High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel in our HSC and HSC+ breast implants in conjunction with our silicone shell allows the breast implants to hold a controlled shape while maintaining a soft feel.
 The silicone material used in our breast implants has been designed to provide the characteristics desired by Plastic Surgeons for breast implants. At present, we are the only company in the United States that has received FDA approval to use High Strength Cohesive silicone gel in breast implants.
 We have completed a number of studies conducted by independent laboratories to demonstrate the competitive advantages of using High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel in our breast implants. We believe this technology differentiates our breast implants for the following reasons:
  
• | our implant gel is stronger, which is evidenced by its resistance to gel fracture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | due to the unique relationship between our implant gel and our implant shells, our implants have an enhanced ability to retain their shape without sacrificing the desired softness; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our shaped implants are softer and more elastic than our competitors’ shaped implants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the beneficial properties of our implants arise from the characteristics of the gel, as well as the integration of the gel with our implant shell. Inside each of our implants, the gel adheres to the shell, creating additional structural strength and shape retention in the implant. This results in the ability to deliver strength and shaping capability without a stiffer gel or implant and without sacrificing the desired softness. We typically evaluate these characteristics using the following metrics:
  
• | Peel‑force. Peel‑force is measured by the amount of force, measured in pound‑force, or lbf, necessary to separate the outer shell of the implant from the internal gel filling. A greater peel‑force measurement indicates greater gel‑shell integration. In the case of anatomically‑shaped implants, greater peel‑force can also be an indication of the ability of the implant to retain its shape, particularly the upper portions of the implant, also referred to as the upper pole. Upper pole stability is of particular importance in preserving the desired anatomical shape of an implant over time. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gel strength. Gel strength is measured by the amount of force, measured in lbf, required to cause permanent fractures in the gel. A larger value indicates greater strength. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gel elasticity and implant elasticity. Gel elasticity and implant elasticity can be measured by the level of resistance, measured in millimeters, or mm, to an applied constant force. A higher value represents greater softness and a lower deformation value represents greater firmness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sientra’s Implant Texture.  We sell breast implants that are available with a smooth outer surface or a textured outer surface. We believe our textured breast implants offer us clinical advantages over our competitors’ textured products, including:
 
• | better tissue adherence to reduce the incidence of malposition and rotation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduction in the rate of capsular contracture, a complication in which the patient’s body creates a scar‑tissue capsule around the implant that can tighten and squeeze the implant potentially causing discomfort, pain and even dislocation of the implant. While we have neither sought nor obtained FDA approval to state that our breast implants reduces the incidence of capsular contracture, we believe it may significantly reduce this risk, as evidenced by the lower rates of capsular contraction reported over a nine‑year follow‑up period in our ongoing clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On a breast implant, the desired texture should have a proportionate amount of surface disruption, as overly aggressive texture can result in double‑capsule formation while not enough texturing can result in a lack of 
 11


adherence resulting in malposition or rotation. We believe that our textured implants have the right combination of surface disruption without overly aggressive texturing.
 By incorporating High‑Strength Cohesive silicone gel and our texturing into our breast implants, we believe we have a competitive advantage in marketing and differentiating our products to Plastic Surgeons.
 miraDry
 miraWave Technology. Our miraWave technology platform utilizes microwave energy to create heat within the skin or subcutaneous locations to create a therapeutic effect. Microwave energy has been used in various medical specialties for heating tissue for decades. In the dermatologic field, it is important that heating is confined to a very precise location, which the miraWave technology platform is designed to do. Due to its proprietary handpiece designs, when used with appropriate energy parameters, the miraDry System can heat dermatologic tissue in a precise and controlled manner.
 
Our miraDry System utilizes microwave energy to deliver heat to the location of the skin where most underarm sweat glands reside – at or just below the skin-fat interface. We designed a proprietary handpiece that automatically focuses the energy at the skin-fat interface, regardless of skin thickness. When the physician or medical professional places the handpiece to a specific area of the underarm as instructed by the graphic user interface, the energy is delivered automatically to the target tissue. The heat generated in the tissue exceeds the threshold for cellular necrosis, thereby ablating the sweat glands where the energy is focused.  Surface cooling prevents the heat from damaging the superficial tissue above the skin-fat interface. In the underarm, many of the hair follicles are in the same relative location as the sweat glands. Therefore, the heating will also cause destruction and elimination of the hair follicles in those areas.
 Our miraDry treatment has been clinically demonstrated to reduce sweat and hair from the underarm without causing injury to critical surrounding structures. The surface cooling protects the epidermis and the majority of the dermis from damaging heat. The deeper underlying structures are protected by two mechanisms. First, our anesthesia protocol calls for creating a distance barrier between the underlying structures and the surface of the skin where the handpiece is positioned. A significant volume of anesthesia fluid is administered between the skin (and target tissue) and the underlying structures, which causes a separation of the target tissue from the underlying structure. As the handpiece is positioned just outside the skin, the underlying structures are further away from the handpiece, keeping them safe from damaging heat. Second, we employ a vacuum suction system in the handpiece where the skin is pulled up into a vacuum chamber within the handpiece. Typically, the underlying structures either remain stationary or move slightly with the vacuum action, thereby creating further distance between the handpiece and the underlying structures.
 Our Clinical Data
 Breast Products
 In 2012, our breast implants were approved by the FDA based on data we collected from our ongoing, long‑term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants and provide Plastic Surgeons and their patients the security and confidence to choose our products. 
 Our breast implant clinical trial is the largest prospective, long‑term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and included the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the long-term clinical trial are subject to serial MRI screening as part of the clinical protocol. The clinical data we collected over a ten‑year follow‑up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States. We have also commissioned a 
 12


number of bench trials run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors.
 We and our two competitors were required to run independent ten‑year clinical studies to obtain PMA approval from the FDA. Our clinical study was not designed to facilitate head‑to‑head comparisons.  However, our clinical data and our competitors’ clinical data are publicly available to both surgeons and patients who are able to use such data to compare and contrast competing implants.
 miraDry
 
Our DRI-UP clinical trial, conducted as an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption study, involved 120 subjects. The results of the study indicated that subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis receiving treatment for the reduction of axillary sweat using the miraDry System had a success rate of 89% as compared to the control group success rate of 54%, with no serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects reported.
 
A second study on the long-term effect of the miraDry System showed all patients who participated in this study reported being no longer bothered by their hyperhidrosis at 24 months, with no serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects.
 
A third, single center study designed to quantify the amount of odor reduction in the axillae after treatment(s) with the miraDry System treated 36 subjects with a miraDry treatment with follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 month and 6 month intervals after treatment.  The study data did not show a statistically significant majority of treated subjects having at least a two point lower malodor score (scale of 0 to 10) but did show a statistically significant average malodor score difference between the treated and untreated axilla using both quantitative odor judges’ scores as well as patients’ subjective self-reported odor severity score (scale of 1 to 10).

If the service provider determines that a replacement system is required, our logistics provider will deliver the replacement miraDry System or module into the physician’s office, set it up and ensure that the miraDry System is working properly.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In most markets outside of North America, our miraDry System is serviced and supported through our independent distributors and certified third-party service providers. We require our distributors to maintain adequate inventory of miraDry Systems and components to facilitate quick response time to service events and to maximize customer “up time.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We provide a standard one year warranty on our miraDry Systems in the U.S. In addition to these product warranties, we offer extended service agreements to our customers to provide protection of their system and handpiece against breakage. However, we do not obtain a material portion of our revenue from our service contracts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Educational and Marketing Initiatives
Breast Products
 We have implemented educational and marketing initiatives with a focus on both Plastic Surgeons and their patients considering breast augmentation or reconstruction.
 Plastic Surgeons.  In order to educate Plastic Surgeons about our product lines and, in particular, about the proper use of our anatomically‑shaped breast implants, we provide a variety of education programs for Plastic Surgeons under the banner of the Sientra Education Forum. To date:

• | we have developed a tablet‑based mobile marketing tool for our sales representatives to use while calling on accounts that includes access to our patient and surgeon labeling, published clinical studies, marketing literature, details on our warranty and C3 programs, our educational iBooks and more.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We deliver four distinct content series to educate patients – Breast Implant Basics, Board-Certified Plastic Surgeons Basics, Scarring, and From Her Lips – as well as sharing applicable third party content about breast procedures and scarring. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 miraDry
 We have implemented targeted marketing and practice support programs. 
  
• | In North America, we provide physicians and their staff product training and sales, marketing, and support services to help them make the miraDry treatment a key component of their practices. In other markets, we have our business development team work to train our distributors and their staff who in turn are responsible for training their customers.

Sales and Marketing
 We sell both our Breast Products and miraDry products in the U.S. through a direct sales organization, which as of December 31, 2017, consisted of 83 employees, including 68 sales representatives and 15 sales managers.  Additionally, we also sell our miraDry System in several international markets where we leverage a combination of distributor relationships and direct sales efforts. As of December 31, 2017, our international operations were supported by 7 employees, including 6 sales representatives and 1 sales manager.
 
We continue to increase our penetration into the international markets in which we currently distribute the miraDry System, as well as expand into new markets through the identification and training of qualified distributors specializing in medical device distribution. We require our international distributors to provide ongoing training and support of their physician customers and invest in the marketing support of practices to expand the market and demand for the miraDry System for physicians and patients. Our distribution agreements generally provide the exclusive right to distribute our products within a designated territory.
 
In addition, our marketing team leads our efforts in brand development, trade show attendance, educational forums, product messaging, website development and advertising, among others.
 Research and Development
 We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were approximately $9.8 million, $9.7 million and $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The addition of miraDry added $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 since the acquisition on July 25, 2017. Our Breast Products segment research and development is focused on enhancing and improving our breast products and tissue expanders, increasing our breast implant portfolio, product development related activities and expanding into synergistic markets. Our miraDry research and development is focused on products and procedure enhancements and development of products for new indications. Product and procedure enhancements include changes to improve efficacy of the therapy, the patient experience, and the physician/operator experience. As related to the miraDry System, for products for new indications, we will seek to leverage our miraWave microwave energy platform to develop products to serve additional needs in dermatology and plastic surgery. The goal is to be able to treat multiple indications with the existing miraDry console using different handpieces and custom software. Our miraDry research and development group is comprised of engineers, microwave scientists and technicians. We believe research and development is important to the success of the Company as we continue to develop and expand our product portfolio.
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 Breast Products
 We hold an FDA Medical Device Establishment Registration.  All of our medical device products are listed under our Device Listing where it indicates we are the specification developer of our products, and except for our breast implant sizers, we are the owner of our products’ FDA approvals and clearances. This means that we are primarily responsible for the design, manufacturing and quality assurance of our products. However, we do not manufacture our products ourselves. Instead, we rely on our third-party manufacturers to manufacture and package our silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and other products to our specifications. When we receive our products from our third-party manufacturers, we inspect a representative sample of packaging and labeling prior to shipping them to our customers. We typically maintain strategic levels of inventory at our storage facilities located in Santa Barbara, California. As a result of the events with Silimed, currently all of the remaining inventory we received from Silimed is located at this storage facility. We have also recently started storing inventory manufactured by Vesta, pending FDA-approval, at this storage facility.  This “at risk” inventory has been quarantined from the remaining Silimed inventories also located at this storage facility.  
 16


We, along with our third-party manufacturers are subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, reporting requirements and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, audits by the FDA. Under the QSR and cGMP requirements, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, must follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. The FDA has regularly inspected both the Company and our suppliers. The Company has never been the subject of any 483 Observations or Warning Letters, or any other FDA assertions that we are in violation of the FDCA.
 Prior to October 2015, 
all of our silicone gel breast implants were manufactured by Silimed. On October 9, 2015, we voluntarily placed a temporary hold on the sale of all Sientra devices manufactured by Silimed and recommended that plastic surgeons discontinue implanting the devices until further notice due to various international regulatory suspensions and inquiries of Silimed at that time.  After ongoing discussions with the FDA, and our own review of the matter with the assi
stance of independent experts in quality management systems, cGMP, and data-based risk assessment, on March 1, 2016, we lifted the hold and informed our Plastic Surgeons of our controlled market re-entry plan designed to optimize our inventory supply, which continues to be limited.  The events involving Silimed will likely continue to adversely impact our business.  See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry” for further detail.  
 On August 9, 2016, we announced our collaboration with Vesta, pursuant to which we are working with Vesta towards establishing a dedicated contract manufacturing facility for our breast implants. On March 14, 2017, we announced that we had executed a definitive manufacturing agreement with Vesta for the manufacture and supply of our breast implants.  In addition, on March 14, 2017, we announced that we had submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta. On January 30, 2018, we announced the FDA has granted approval of the site-change PMA, supplement for our contract manufacturer, Vesta, to manufacture our silicone gel breast implants.  In support of the move to the Vesta manufacturing facility, we also implemented new manufacturing process improvements which, in consultation with the FDA, required three (3) additional filings.  In addition to approving the manufacturing site-change supplement, the FDA has approved two (2) of these three (3) process enhancement filings, while requesting additional information for the third submission.  We continue to work closely with the FDA to address their information requests related to this third and final outstanding submission in order to resolve these matters in a timely manner.
 
miraDry
 We occupy an approximately 29,000 square foot facility located in Santa Clara, California dedicated to the manufacture, distribution, and servicing of miraDry Systems and accessories.
 All final assembly, calibration and testing of our miraDry Systems are performed at our Santa Clara facility. The consumable bioTip is manufactured by a contract manufacturer, Healthcare Technology International Limited (HTI), at their facility in Dongguan, China. Consumables are tested and packaged at our Santa Clara facility, then sent to Parter Sterilization Services in Carson, CA for ethylene oxide sterilization.
 A critical component of our miraDry System is the custom microwave power amplifier contained in the miraDry console. The amplifier is manufactured by a single source manufacturer, Broadband Wireless, LLC, in Reno, Nevada (a subsidiary of United States Technologies, Inc.), or Broadband. We fully own the design and manufacturing process for this amplifier.
 Manufacturing facilities that produce finished medical devices intended for distribution in the United States and internationally are subject to regulation and periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. In the United States, we are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our products. The FDA most recently inspected our facility in August 2016 and at the conclusion of such routine audit, a Form 483 was issued with two observations. The FDA acknowledged receipt of periodic status reports documenting the completion of corrections and corrective actions taken by us to address each of the two observations. The FDA will verify acceptability of the actions taken during its next routine inspection. No further actions are required at this time. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality management system certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications for the miraDry System: ISO 13485:2003 
 17


Quality Management Systems Requirements, in support of both our CE marking and Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS)  requirements. Our notified body, NSAI, most recently audited our facility in November 2017 and subsequently renewed our ISO 13485-2003 certification.
 HTI, our disposables manufacturer, and Parton Sterilization Services, our sterilization service provider comply with the FDA’s QSR and are registered in good standing with the FDA. Additionally, we have procedures in place designed to ensure that all other purchased products and materials conform to specified requirements, including evaluation of suppliers, and where required, qualification of the components supplied.
 Competition 
 Breast Products
 The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We primarily compete with two companies that manufacture and sell breast implants in the United States: Johnson & Johnson through its wholly owned subsidiary, Mentor Worldwide, LLC, or Mentor, and Allergan plc, or Allergan.
 Both of our U.S. competitors are either publicly‑traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly‑traded companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. These companies have greater financial resources for sales, marketing and product development, broader established relationships with healthcare providers and third‑party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For example, Allergan sells temporary gel sizers for silicone gel implants and we sell only temporary saline filled sizers. In addition, our competitors may offer pricing programs with discounts across their non‑breast aesthetic product portfolios.
 We also face potential future competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing medical device companies that may be pursuing new implant technologies, new material technologies and new methods of enhancing and reconstructing the breast.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include:
  
• | breadth of portfolio;
--+----------------------


• | technological characteristics of products;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | clinical evidence;
--+-------------------


• | product price;
--+---------------


• | customer service; and
--+----------------------


• | support by key opinion leaders.
--+--------------------------------

 miraDry
 The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic, and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for the miraDry treatment could be limited by the products and technologies offered now or in the future by our competitors as well as the limited capital expenditure budgets of our physician customers. We designed the miraDry treatment to address the concerns of individuals who seek a durable solution to their axillary sweat. Therefore, we compete both directly and indirectly with those companies marketing botulinum toxin and other medical device companies. To a lesser extent, we indirectly compete with antiperspirants. We expect aesthetic medical device companies to pursue technological advances in the treatment of sweat, hair and odor removal that will continue to alter the competitive environment.
 
18


In the United States, our major competitor in the treatment of sweat is Allergan, which manufactures Botox; Botox is approved for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Cynosure also has recently received FDA clearance to market PrecisionTX for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. These competitors have more resources than us and may prevent our miraDry System from gaining widespread market acceptance.
 Due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are approved or cleared for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we face more competition in these markets than in the United States.
 Government Regulation
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, and other regulatory bodies in other countries. 
 Regulation by the FDA.  The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern, among other things:
  
• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | pre‑clinical and clinical testing;
--+-----------------------------------


• | establishment registration and product listing;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | product labeling and storage;
--+------------------------------


• | pre‑market clearance or approval;
--+----------------------------------


• | post‑market studies;
--+---------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | product sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------


• | record-keeping and device tracking;
--+------------------------------------


• | complaint handling;
--+--------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | post‑market surveillance and adverse event reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a pre‑market notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA approval processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Unless specifically exempted from certain requirements, all three classes of devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre‑market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR, which cover manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, 
 19


production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Devices deemed to pose low to moderate risk are placed in Class I or II, which, absent an exemption, requires the applicant to obtain a 510(k) clearance. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post‑market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling requirements, as well as general controls. Some low risk devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. A PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life‑sustaining, life‑supporting or certain implantable devices, including all breast implants, or devices that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution in the United states before May 28, 1976 for which a regulation requiring a PMA application has not been issued by the FDA.
 Our tissue expanders and our body contouring, facial and nasal implants received FDA clearance as Class II devices at various dates prior to approval of our breast implants in March 2012. Additionally, the miraDry System is currently regulated as a Class II device that requires 510(k) clearance.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre‑market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a preamendment device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre‑market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre‑market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new pre‑market submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite 510(k) clearance(s) or PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.
 Silicone gel breast implants are treated as Class III devices and a full PMA is required. A PMA for our breast implants was approved by the FDA in March 2012. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive information regarding the product, including pre‑clinical, clinical, and other product data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the intended manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process.
 The FDA may approve a PMA application with post‑approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long‑term follow‑up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for significant modifications 
 20


to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
 Clinical Trials.  A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and may be required for a 510(k) pre‑market notification. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support product clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non‑significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the Sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects, unless the product is deemed a non‑significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the responsible institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. During a study, we are required to comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them. We are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare privacy. The investigators must also obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record-keeping requirements. The FDA’s grant of permission to proceed with clinical testing does not constitute a binding commitment that the FDA will consider the study design adequate to support clearance or approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical study will meet chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval.
 Other Regulatory Requirements.  Even though our devices have been approved and commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply after a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre‑market pathway. These include, but are not limited to:

• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, or “off‑label,” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion (in addition, the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of the advertising of medical devices other than “restricted” devices);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA requires us to conduct post‑market surveillance studies and to maintain a system for tracking our breast implants through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.
 Failure by us or our manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include, but may not be limited to, any of the following sanctions or consequences:
  
• | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


• | delays in or refusal to grant requests for 510(k) clearance or pre‑market approval of new products or modified products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product recall, detention or seizure;
--+--------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions and consent decrees; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 We and our contract manufacturers and some suppliers of components or device accessories also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with cGMP requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic, unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
 Healthcare Regulatory Laws.  Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, marketing, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities may  be subject to regulation under additional healthcare laws by numerous regulatory and enforcement authorities in the United States, in addition to the FDA. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, false claims, physician sunshine, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
 22


Additionally, our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Non‑compliance with the laws described below may generally result in the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any actions for non‑compliance of such laws can be costly, time‑consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 Federal Anti‑Kickback Law.  The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, recommendation, order or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as improper payments, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at other than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
 The penalties for violating the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated.  In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA.
 We have entered into consulting, speaker and other financial arrangements with physicians, including some who prescribe or recommend our products to patients. We engage such physicians as consultants, advisors and to educate other physicians. Noncompliance with the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute could result in the penalties set forth above.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act.  The FCA prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. Penalties for FCA violations include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781.40 and $21,562.80 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal FCA is a civil statute, FCA violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
 In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, known as “qui tam”, or whistleblower, lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 23


Federal Criminal False Claims Laws.  The federal criminal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully making, or causing to be made, a false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining the right to any benefit or payment under a federal health care program. A violation of these laws may constitute a felony or misdemeanor and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law.  The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, augmented two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from governmental programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, that certain types of entities and individuals adopts uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA’s standards and requirements directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.  
 In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
 Physician Payments Sunshine Act.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, PPACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for 
 24


“knowing failures,” for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. We are required to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by March 31st of each calendar year.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties
 Additional State Healthcare Laws.  Many states have also adopted some form of each of the aforementioned laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable laws.
 United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits United States corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
 International Regulation. We are approved to sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America. International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. We may evaluate international expansion opportunities in the future for Breast Products. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self‑assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third‑party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country‑by‑country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country‑by‑country basis in order for us to market our Breast Products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement.  Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products will be covered by third‑party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Breast augmentation and miraDry procedures are generally performed on a cash‑pay basis and are not covered by third‑party payors. In contrast, breast reconstruction procedures may be 
 25


covered by third‑party payors, but such third‑party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and results.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product or procedure may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product or procedure. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or procedure. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability.
 Health Reform.  The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. 
 There have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding coverage from government or commercial payors. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), and lawsuits have been brought challenging aspects of the law at various points. There have been repeated recent attempts by Congress to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has previously been successful at passing comprehensive repeal legislation through both Chambers of Congress, it had then been vetoed by former President Obama; however full repeal legislation is unlikely in the current political climate.  Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 included a provision that would repeal one of the primary pillars of the law, the ACA’s individual mandate penalty that essentially assessed a monetary penalty or fine on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year.  Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the ACA on a provision-by-provision basis.
 The ACA had also imposed, among other things, a federal excise tax of 2.3% on certain entities that manufacture or import medical devices for sale in the United States.  This tax had previously been suspended, and on January 22, 2018 both the House and Senate struck a short-term Continuing Resolution to fund the federal government, H.R. 195, which included a two-year suspension on the medical device excise tax.  This two-year delay is retroactively applied starting December 31, 2017, and will officially extend through January 1, 2020.  The future of this provision beyond that point is uncertain, as there may be additional attempt to fully repeal the provision.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our product lines. We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, confidential information, copyrights, patent rights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property. 
 Our Breast Products trademark portfolio consists of seven registered U.S. trademarks. Our miraDry trademark portfolio consists of 97 worldwide registered trademarks and 30 pending trademark applications.
 Our Breast Products patent portfolio consists of 1 pending U.S. patent application, as well as several in-licensed patent rights. Our miraDry patent portfolio is comprised of 21 granted or allowed U.S. patents, 80 granted or allowed foreign counterpart patents, 10 pending or published U.S. patent applications, and 34 pending or published foreign counterpart patent applications. 
 In addition, to protect our trade secrets, confidential information and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. 
 There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further details on these risks, see Item 1A — “Risk Factors.” 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 200 full‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Seasonality
 We expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures and purchase of miraDry procedures. We believe that aesthetic procedures are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to patients planning their procedures leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season. 
Corporate Information
 We incorporated in Delaware on August 29, 2003 under the name Juliet Medical, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to Sientra, Inc. in April 2007. Our principal executive offices are located at 420 South Fairview Avenue, Suite 200, Santa Barbara, California, 93117, and our telephone number is (805) 562‑3500. Our website is located at www.sientra.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investors.sientra.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and our Proxy Statements are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably possible after we file them with the SEC.
