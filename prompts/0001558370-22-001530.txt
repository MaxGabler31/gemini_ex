​
Overview
​
Watts Regulator Co. was founded by Joseph E. Watts in 1874 in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Watts Regulator Co. started as a small machine shop supplying parts to the New England textile mills of the 19th century and grew into a global manufacturer of products and systems focused on the control, conservation and quality of water and the comfort and safety of the people using it. Watts Water Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1985 and is the parent company of Watts Regulator Co.
​
Our strategy is to be the preferred supplier of differentiated products, solutions and systems that manage and conserve the flow of fluids and energy into, through and out of buildings in the commercial and residential markets of the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (“APMEA”), our three geographic segments. Within this framework, we focus upon three themes: safety and regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. This strategy provides us with a platform to increase our earnings via sales growth, both organic and inorganic, and the systematic reduction of manufacturing costs and operational expenses.
​
Our strategy is to expand organically by introducing new complementary products and solutions in existing markets, by enhancing our preferred brands, by promoting plumbing code development to drive the need for safety and quality products and by continually improving merchandising in our wholesale distribution channels. We focus on selling solutions to our customers that integrate a variety of our product offerings. We target selected new products and geographic markets based on growth potential, including our ability to leverage our existing distribution channels. Additionally, we leverage our distribution channels through the introduction of new products and solutions, as well as the integration of products of our acquired companies.
​
The Internet of Things (“IoT”) has allowed companies to transform components and products into smart and connected devices. We remain committed to enhancing our smart and connected capabilities by expanding our internal competencies and making strategic acquisitions.  We continue to focus our efforts related to our smart and connected strategy by investing in IoT architecture development, enhancing digital tools used by our customers, including Watts’ website, and investing in new smart and connected product development projects. Our strategy focuses on three dimensions: Connect, Control and Conserve. We have introduced and plan to continue offering new products that will connect our customers with smart systems, control systems for optimal performance, and conserve critical resources by increasing operability, efficiency and safety. Our goal is to derive 25% of our revenue from smart and connected products by 2023. 
​
We continue to focus on sustainability by taking steps to reduce the negative impact our operations have on the environment while generating economic value by manufacturing and selling products, solutions and technologies that 

3




enable our customers to reduce the negative impact they have on the environment. As a leading global water technology company, we address some of the world's most important sustainability priorities – the conservation, control and safe use of water. Our smart and connected strategy is anchored by a commitment to connect our customers to smart systems, control those systems for optimal performance, and conserve critical water and other resources by increasing operability, efficiency, and safety. Internally, we have reduced our global water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, improved our safety performance, made our work environment more diverse, equitable and inclusive, and maintained robust ethics and compliance programs to help ensure we do business with integrity and in accordance with high ethical standards.
​
We intend to generate incremental growth by targeting select acquisitions, both in our core markets and in new complementary markets. We have completed 12 acquisitions since 2012. Our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of safety and regulation, energy efficiency and water conservation. We target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following: an entry into new markets, improved channel access, unique and/or proprietary technologies, advanced production capabilities or complementary solution offerings.
​
We are committed to reducing our manufacturing and operating costs using Lean methodologies to drive improvement across all key processes. We have a number of manufacturing facilities in lower-cost regions. In recent years, we have announced global restructuring plans which reduced our manufacturing and distribution footprint in order to reduce our costs and to realize incremental operating efficiencies.
​
Additionally, a majority of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9000, 9001 or 9002 certified by the International Organization for Standardization.
​
The majority of our sales are for products that have been approved under regulatory standards incorporated into state and municipal plumbing, heating, building and fire protection codes in the Americas, Europe, and certain countries within APMEA. We have consistently advocated for the development and enforcement of plumbing codes and are committed to providing products to meet these standards.
​
COVID-19 Pandemic and Supply Chain Disruptions
​
The COVID-19 pandemic and its widespread global impact presented new and unique challenges for us, affecting our employees, operations and how we safely work, as well as impacting our customers, supply chain, channels and distribution partners. Many of our products qualify as “essential products” under local, state and national guidelines and orders. Throughout 2020, we experienced temporary shutdowns of a few of our facilities in Europe and temporarily reduced capacity at other facilities, but otherwise we were able to keep most of our facilities open and employees working, manage our supply chain and continue to make our products available to our customers. Our operations in China were impacted beginning early in the first quarter of 2020, followed by our Europe and then Americas segments, which experienced the initial impact of the pandemic late in the first quarter of 2020. Temporary closures, lockdowns and other restrictions mandated by various government authorities intended to combat the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our business at varying levels within each of our operating segments as customers curtailed and reduced overall spending in response to the protective measures implemented and the resulting economic impacts. We implemented cost management and capital preservation actions early in 2020 in response to these impacts. As the second half of 2020 progressed and government-imposed restrictions subsided, we noted market activity levels increasing with sales and profits improving sequentially from the second to fourth quarters. Profits improved in part from better volumes and in part from the cost actions we executed in response to the pandemic. Results in 2021 continued that trend of improved top line growth and profit performance. However, as worldwide economies recover from the pandemic, increased market demand is straining suppliers’ ability to fill orders. This has been compounded by logistical issues throughout the supply chain. Labor shortages and other workforce disruptions have affected our manufacturing and distribution processes, as well as our suppliers, including higher absenteeism caused by illness from virus variants or quarantine measures. Our operating response and mitigation actions are discussed within Item. 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Despite these ongoing challenges, we continued to invest in our business, including new products, our connected solutions and our growth and productivity initiatives. We achieved record performance for 2021 despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the supply chain disruption, while committing to the safety of our employees, meeting our customers’ needs and continuing to invest in our long-term strategy.

​
Commercial and Operational Excellence
​
We strive to invest in product innovation that meets the wants and needs of our customers. Our focus is on differentiated products and solutions that will provide greater opportunity to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace. Conversely, we continue to migrate away from commoditized products where it is more difficult to add value. Our goal is to be a solutions provider, not merely a components supplier. We refer to this customer-facing mindset as commercial excellence, and we are continually looking for strategic opportunities to invest or divest, where necessary, in order to meet those objectives. In conjunction with this customer-centric focus, we continually review our operations to ensure we can efficiently and effectively produce and deliver products to customers. We are also striving to simplify our administrative operations to drive further efficiencies. We call this aspect of our business operational excellence.
​
Customers and Markets
​
We sell our products to plumbing, heating and mechanical wholesale distributors and dealers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), specialty product distributors, and major do-it-yourself (DIY) and retail chains. 
​
Wholesalers. Approximately 61%, 60% and 61% of our net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were to wholesale distributors for commercial and residential applications. 
​
OEMs. Approximately 15% of our net sales in 2021 and 2020, and 14% of our net sales in 2019 were to OEMs. In the Americas, our typical OEM customers are water heater manufacturers and equipment and water systems manufacturers needing flow control devices and other products. Our sales to OEMs in Europe are primarily to boiler manufacturers and radiant system manufacturers. Our sales to OEMs in APMEA are primarily to water heater, air conditioning, and appliance manufacturers. 
​
Specialty. Approximately 19% of our net sales in 2021 and 2020, and 21% of our net sales in 2019 were through our specialty channel. The specialty channel primarily includes sales related to high-efficiency boilers and water heaters, 

5




water filtration and conditioning products, specialty floor and tile products, food service products and leak detection products.

​
In 2021, 2020 and 2019, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. Our top ten customers accounted for $371.5 million, or 20.5%, of our total net sales in 2021; $344.1 million, or 22.8%, of our total net sales in 2020; and $359.1 million, or 22.4%, of our total net sales in 2019. Thousands of other customers constituted the balance of our net sales in each of those years.
​
Marketing and Sales
​
For product sales in the Americas, we rely primarily on commissioned manufacturers’ representatives to market our product lines, some of which maintain a consigned inventory of our products. These representatives sell primarily to plumbing and heating wholesalers and contractors or supply DIY stores. Our specialty channel products in the Americas are sold through independent representatives, dealers and distributors. We also sell products directly to wholesalers, OEMs and private label accounts primarily in Europe and APMEA, and, to a lesser extent, in the Americas. 
​
Manufacturing
​
We have integrated and automated manufacturing capabilities, including a state-of-the-art foundry dedicated exclusively to the production of products that qualify as “lead-free” under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act; and machining capabilities, plastic extrusion, and injection molding and assembly operations. Our foundry operations include metal pouring systems, automatic core making, and brass and bronze die-castings. Our machining operations feature computer-controlled machine tools, high-speed chucking machines with robotics, robotic assembly capability, laser cutting technology, and automatic screw machines for machining bronze, brass and steel components. Our heating and hot water product manufacturing capabilities include all phases of light and heavy gauge metal fabrication, incorporating the latest technology for welding and brazing, as well as laser cutting; automated and robotic applications; and metal finishing, which includes chemical passivation of stainless steel. We have invested in recent years to expand our manufacturing capabilities and to adopt the most efficient and productive equipment. We are committed to maintaining our manufacturing equipment at a level consistent with current technology in order to maintain high levels of quality and manufacturing efficiencies. In 2021, we continued to invest in our systems and in our manufacturing facilities and our commercial and operational excellence initiatives.
​
Capital expenditures and depreciation for each of the last three years were as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
---------------------+---+--------------------------+------+------+---+------+---+---+-----
​ | ​ | Years Ended December 31,

Depreciation | ​ | $ | 31.4 | ​ | $ | 31.3 | ​ | $ | 31.0

​
Purchased Raw Materials and Components
​
Our products are made using various purchased components and raw materials, including primarily bronze, brass, cast iron, stainless steel, steel, and plastic. Substantially all of the raw materials we require to manufacture our products are purchased from outside sources. The commodity markets have experienced tremendous volatility over the past several years, particularly with respect to copper and stainless steel, and currently we are experiencing high inflationary pressures in these markets. Tariffs impact the total cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into manufacturing them. Increased tariff costs could adversely impact the gross margin we earn on our products. Because we internationally source a significant amount of raw materials and components, several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are not able to predict whether component costs or commodity costs, including copper and stainless steel, will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If component costs or commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If component costs or commodity costs were to decline, we may experience pressure from 

6




customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.
​
With limited exceptions, we have multiple suppliers for our components and raw materials. We believe our relationships with our key suppliers are good and that an interruption in supply from any one supplier would not materially affect our ability to meet our immediate demands while another supplier is qualified. We regularly review our suppliers to evaluate their strengths. If a supplier is unable to meet our demands, we believe that in most cases our inventory of components and raw materials will allow for sufficient time to identify and obtain the necessary commodities and other raw materials from an alternate source. We believe that the nature of the components and raw materials used in our business are such that multiple sources are generally available in the market. However, our current and alternative suppliers are largely concentrated in China. The occurrence of natural disasters, public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics, political crises such as war, terrorism or political instability, or other events that result in widespread business or supply chain disruptions in China could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain necessary components and raw materials and our business and operating results could suffer. 
​
The current global supply chain disruptions are impacting our supply of raw materials and purchased components. Refer to Item. 1A “Risk Factors” for risks related to the impact of supply chain and logistic disruptions and Item. 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional disclosure.
​
Code Compliance
​
Products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement, which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria. Codes and standards in the Americas are established by industry and government organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the American Society of Sanitary Engineering (ASSE), NSF International (NSF) Underwriters Laboratories (UL), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Californian Energy Commission (CEC), the International Code Council (ICC) and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO). Many of the codes and standards are incorporated into state and municipal plumbing and heating, building and fire protection codes.
​
National regulatory standards in Europe vary by country. The major standards and/or guidelines that our products must meet are AFNOR (France), DVGW (Germany), UNI/ICIM (Italy), SVGW (Switzerland), SITAC (Sweden), WRAS (United Kingdom) and CEN (Denmark). Further, there are local regulatory standards requiring compliance as well.
​
We consistently advocate for the development and enforcement of plumbing codes and standards. Our product-testing capabilities and dedicated investments are areas of strength for us. Manufacturing operations consistently maintain stringent quality control and testing procedures, thus ensuring products remain in continuous compliance with all requirements. Investment in product-testing capability and in plant and equipment also ensures ongoing continuous product compliance. Additionally, a majority of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9000, 9001 or 9002 certified by the International Organization for Standardization.
​
Watts also proactively monitors and participates in regulatory, codes and standards development activities with the various aforementioned entities and others. We are a primary participating member of the U.S.-based voluntary industry association American Supply Association (ASA), which provides its members with industry information and coordinates resources for addressing regulatory issues and developing and maintaining codes and standards. Watts is also a member of the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating (CIPH), which provides a similar function and benefit as ASA by monitoring and advocating on behalf of its members on various legislative and regulatory issues.
​
New Product Development and Engineering
​
We retain our own product development staff, design teams, and testing laboratories in the Americas, Europe and APMEA that work to enhance our existing products and develop new products and solutions with a focus on sustainable customer-centric technological innovation and smart and connected solutions. We maintain sophisticated product development and testing laboratories and continue to invest in our smart and connected product pipeline. We employ a global new-product development process that is used to prioritize, guide and support new projects. Over the years, we have continued to bring innovation to our markets, with the continued expansion of our IntelliStation® smart mixing system with the new Connected IntelliStation Junior enhancing energy savings and safety. We also continue to focus on 

7




smart leak detection and prevention solutions for both residential and commercial applications and recently launched our Connected IntelliFlow® Washing Machine flood prevention system and ACV Assure™ Municipal Water Monitoring System solution. Our new Lync® brand offers expertly designed and pre-assembled commercial water technology system solutions improving efficiency, safety and water quality while minimizing planning, design and installation time. Our Aegis® brand delivers natural, non-toxic refrigerant-grade CO2, making Lync’s Aegis electric heat pumps one of the cleanest, most efficient and environmentally friendly ways to heat domestic water. We recently launched our Lync Element® Q as one of the world’s first hot water wellness solutions with multi-barrier pathogen mitigation. We have expanded our sustainability focused product offerings in Europe, driving energy efficiency with the launch of our Vision® wired and wireless thermostats. As we continue to expand development in APMEA, we launched a Chinese version of our successful IntelliStation Senior, significantly enhancing user experience and providing a competitive advantage in the China market. In Australia, we launched the SS009 backflow to help grow the strategic commercial market.
​
In 2021, we launched 21 new smart and connected product offerings. We will continue to focus on and invest in our global new product development program to leverage new technologies, inhouse expertise and our electronics capabilities to expand our smart and connected strategy. 
​
Competition
​
The domestic and international markets for energy efficient products, water conservation devices, and products that address the safety and regulation for the flow of fluids, are intensely competitive and require us to compete against some companies possessing greater financial, marketing and other resources than ours. Due to the breadth of our product offerings, the number and identities of our competitors vary by product line and market. We consider quality, brand preference, delivery times, engineering specifications, plumbing code requirements, price, technological expertise, breadth of product offerings and smart and connected products and solutions to be the primary competitive factors. We believe that new product development and product engineering are also important to success in the water industry and that our position in the industry is attributable in part to our ability to develop new and innovative products quickly and to adapt and enhance existing products. We continue to develop new and innovative products to expand our market position and are implementing manufacturing and design programs to reduce costs. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop new products will be successful or that our customers will accept our new products. Although we own certain patents and trademarks that we consider to be of importance, we do not believe that our business and competitiveness as a whole are dependent on any one of our patents or trademarks or on patent or trademark protection generally.
​
Human Capital Management
​
We believe that our employees are our greatest asset. As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,597 employees globally, including 2,063 in the Americas, 2,239 in Europe and 295 in APMEA. At Watts, hiring the right talent is only the beginning. By developing and promoting our talented people, we are creating value for our customers and shareholders today, while advancing our Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) goals. As the economy and our business grow, so does the need for qualified candidates; hence we are always competing for talent in an environment of increasingly challenged supply. To that end, we have developed, and continue to enhance and refine, a robust and comprehensive talent management strategy that spans from talent attraction to performance management, career development and retention of our top talent and, ultimately, to succession planning across our organization. We continually strive to cultivate and support a highly engaged and productive workforce.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
​
An integral part of our mission to build a high performance, values-driven culture is creating an inclusive culture that welcomes and celebrates diversity. Our path to innovation starts and ends with our employees, who are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of Watts. Everything we accomplish depends on creating an environment that is engaging and supportive and enables employees to perform to their potential. This is why we have initiated a comprehensive approach to diversity, equity and inclusion focusing on awareness and education programs for our leaders and employees; monitoring engagement through employee survey feedback; creating awareness with our employees about diversity, equity and inclusion topics through our company intranet, in employee meetings and on our public website; and improving our hiring and leadership development processes to increase diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels at Watts. We have also encouraged the visibility of diverse employees through the recent formation of employee resource groups, which are voluntary employee-led groups that provide a forum for employees to share common interests and experiences, gain professional development support, engage with our leadership teams, and drive initiatives to improve diversity, equity and inclusion at Watts. 
​
Sustainability
​
Commitment to Sustainability
​
We have demonstrated our commitment to environmental sustainability by reducing our impact on the environment in multiple areas of our global business and by providing innovative products and solutions that enable our customers to reduce their impact on the environment. We are also focused on building a sustainable company by adhering to 

9




responsible business practices, prioritizing employee safety and providing our employees with opportunities for personal and professional growth, including through programs and initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. We also strive to have a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work and other communities in need through community involvement, educational partnerships and charitable giving.
​
Sustainability Leadership
​
Our Board of Directors has overall authority and responsibility for our sustainability efforts, as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition to general Board oversight, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of governance matters, the Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight of human capital issues and the Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of our corporate ethics and compliance program. At the management level, our General Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, has general oversight responsibility for all sustainability matters. Our General Counsel and Chief Sustainability Officer also chairs our global Sustainability Steering Committee, which is made up of senior company leaders and is responsible for formulating our sustainability strategy and overseeing the execution of our environmental, social and governance initiatives.
​
Sustainability Strategy
​
The materiality principle is one of the core principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In order to address the principle of materiality, a company should undertake a process of identifying its key material topics that have the greatest financial, environmental and social impact on its business, as well as those topics regarded as highly important by its key internal and external stakeholder groups. In 2021, we conducted a sustainability materiality assessment with the assistance of an external consultant. The results of that assessment were used by the Sustainability Steering Committee to identify our key focus areas and from there to build a strategy to address the material environmental, social and governance topics identified by the materiality assessment.
​
Environmental Stewardship
​
We have made substantial progress in minimizing the environmental impact of our operations. Recent initiatives have resulted in a reduction on our global water consumption and our greenhouse gas emissions, including through the implementation of smart monitoring systems in many of our high water use facilities to promote early leak and surge detection and investments in various energy reduction projects. With respect to our product handprint, we provide a portfolio of products, components and systems that conserve water, save energy, reduce waste and preserve water quality and safety. In addition, our goal is to embed sustainability throughout the lifecycle of our products with our goal being to create safe, efficient, long-lasting products made with high-recycling-value materials wherever possible.
​
Social Responsibility
​
We are committed to creating both economic and social value and strive to have a positive impact on our global community. During 2021, we supported those in need through donations of money and products to several non-profit charitable organizations and through the volunteer efforts of our employees. One example was our ongoing partnership with the Planet Water Foundation. During 2021, we worked with Planet Water to fund the construction of six AquaTowers and AquaSan systems, which provide clean, safe drinking water for up to 10,800 people in Cambodia, India, Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam.
​
Governance, Business Ethics, and Compliance
​
We believe that good corporate governance and an environment of high ethical standards are important for us to achieve business success and to create value for our stockholders. Our Board is committed to high governance standards and continually works to improve them. We periodically review our corporate governance policies and practices and compare them to those suggested by various authorities on corporate governance and employed by other public companies and consider changes to our corporate governance policies and practices in light of such guidance and interpretations. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct applicable to all officers, employees and Board members worldwide that serves as the foundation for our ethics and compliance program, and drives policy development, training initiatives, and reinforcement of our values throughout the global organization.

​
Product Liability, Environmental and Other Litigation Matters
​
We are subject to a variety of potential liabilities connected with our business operations, including potential liabilities and expenses associated with possible product defects or failures and compliance with environmental laws. We maintain product liability and other insurance coverage, which we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices. Nonetheless, such insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us fully against substantial damage claims. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

We have been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to a limited number of identified contaminated sites. The levels of contamination vary significantly from site to site as do the related levels of remediation efforts. Environmental liabilities are recorded based on the most probable cost, if known, or on the estimated minimum cost of remediation. Accruals are not discounted to their present value, unless the amount and timing of expenditures are fixed and reliably determinable. We accrue estimated environmental liabilities based on assumptions, which are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties. Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of these estimates include identification of additional sites, environmental regulations, level of clean-up required, technologies available, number and financial condition of other contributors to remediation and the time period over which remediation may occur. We recognize changes in estimates as new remediation requirements are defined or as new information becomes available. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
​
Asbestos Litigation
​
We are defending approximately 400 lawsuits in different jurisdictions, alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos. The complaints in these cases typically name a large number of defendants and do not identify any of our particular products as a source of asbestos exposure. To date, discovery has failed to yield evidence of substantial exposure to any of our products and no judgments have been entered against us.
​
Other Litigation
​
Other lawsuits and proceedings or claims, arising from the ordinary course of operations, are also pending or threatened against us.
