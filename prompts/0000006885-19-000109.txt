ITEM 1.                                        BUSINESS
Our Business
Stage Stores, Inc. and its subsidiary (“we,” “us” or “our”) is a retailer, which operates specialty department stores and off-price stores. We offer our customers, referred to as “guests,” trend-right, moderately priced, name-brand apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods. As of February 2, 2019, we operated in 42 states through 727 department stores under the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES and STAGE nameplates and 68 GORDMANS off-price stores. We also operate an e-commerce website for our department store business. Our department stores are predominantly located in small towns and rural communities. Our off-price stores are predominantly located in mid-sized, non-rural Midwest markets.
Our History
Stage Stores, Inc. was formed in 1988 when the management of Palais Royal, together with several venture capital firms, acquired the family-owned Bealls and Palais Royal chains, both of which were originally founded in the 1920s. At the time of the acquisition, Palais Royal operated primarily larger stores, located in and around the Houston metropolitan area, while Bealls operated primarily smaller stores, principally located in rural Texas towns. 
In 2003, we acquired Peebles Inc. (“Peebles”), a privately held, similarly small-market focused department store chain headquartered in South Hill, Virginia. Our Peebles stores are located in the Mid Atlantic, Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. 
In July 2009, we acquired the “Goody’s” name from Goody’s Family Clothing, Inc. through a bankruptcy auction. Our Goody’s stores are primarily located in the Southeastern and Midwestern states. 
On April 7, 2017, we acquired select assets of Gordmans Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries through a bankruptcy auction (“Gordmans Acquisition”). The results of the Gordmans stores that we operated since the Gordmans Acquisition are included in our consolidated statements of operations (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). Our Gordmans stores are primarily located in the Midwestern states. 
Competition 
The department store and off-price retail markets are highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with local, regional, national and online retailers, including department, specialty, discount and off-price stores, direct-to-consumer businesses and other forms of retail commerce. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the principal differentiating factors that allow us to compete for guests’ patronage include great values on name brand merchandise, assortments that appeal to our target guests, convenient locations, credit availability and our loyalty program.

Stores
Store Openings and Closures. Since the Gordmans Acquisition in 2017, we have focused on growing our off-price business. During 2018, we converted nine department stores to off-price stores and opened one new off-price store. Based on the strong results of these stores and growth potential in the off-price sector, we plan to convert approximately 85 department stores to off-price in 2019, and another 150 in the first half of 2020. The conversions will bring our off-price store count to approximately 300, representing approximately 50% of our total sales volume in 2020. 
As part of a strategic evaluation of our department store portfolio in 2015, we announced a multi-year plan to close stores that we believe do not have the potential to meet our sales productivity and profitability standards. We have since permanently closed 122 department stores, including 41 stores during 2018, and we expect to close approximately 40 to 60 department stores in 2019. We continually review the profitability of each store and will consider closing a store if the expected store performance does not meet our financial standards. The closure of these stores is expected to improve our ability to effectively allocate capital, deliver higher sales productivity and be accretive to earnings.
Store count and selling square footage by nameplate are as follows:

 | Number of Stores | Selling Square Footage (in thousands)
 | February 3, 2018 | 2018 Activity Net Changes | | February 2, 2019 | February 3, 2018 | 2018 Activity Net Changes | | February 2, 2019
Bealls | 181 | | (7 | ) | 174 | | 3,616 | | (68 | ) | 3,548 
Goody's | 217 | | (19 | ) | 198 | | 3,363 | | (339 | ) | 3,024 
Palais Royal | 46 | | (6 | ) | 40 | | 990 | | (139 | ) | 851 
Peebles | 185 | | (13 | ) | 172 | | 3,390 | | (225 | ) | 3,165 
Stage | 148 | | (5 | ) | 143 | | 2,778 | | (83 | ) | 2,695 
Gordmans | 58 | | 10 | | 68 | | 2,825 | | 265 | | 3,090 
Total | 835 | | (40 | ) | 795 | | 16,962 | | (589 | ) | 16,373

Our department stores are predominantly located in small towns and rural communities. Utilizing a ten-mile radius from each store, approximately 61% of our department stores are located in communities with populations below 50,000 people, while an additional 24% of our department stores are located in communities with populations between 50,000 and 150,000 people. The remaining 15% of our department stores are located in higher-density markets with populations greater than 150,000 people, such as Houston, San Antonio and Lubbock, Texas. 
Our Gordmans off-price stores are predominantly located in mid-sized, non-rural Midwestern markets. The majority of our planned conversion stores are located in smaller Midwestern markets.

Merchandising
We offer moderately priced, branded merchandise within distinct merchandise categories of women’s, men’s and children’s apparel, accessories, cosmetics, footwear and home goods that reflect current styles and trends through our department stores, off-price stores and e-commerce website. Our department stores offer a deeper, more curated assortment and our off-price stores offer a scarcity driven, treasure-hunt experience. Merchandise mix may vary from store to store to accommodate differing demographic, regional and climate characteristics.
The following charts depict the distribution of net sales among our various merchandise categories: 
Approximately 83% of sales in our department stores consist of national brands such as Adidas, Calvin Klein, Carters, Chaps, Clinique, Dockers, Estee Lauder, G by Guess, Izod, Jessica Simpson, Levi’s, Nike, Nine West and Skechers, while the remaining 17% of sales are private label merchandise. Our off-price stores offer national brands purchased opportunistically, bringing greater value to our guests. 
We source our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign vendors. We have no significant long-term purchase commitments or arrangements with any of our vendors, and believe that we are not dependent on any one vendor. We believe we have good working relationships with our vendors.

Merchandise Distribution
 We distribute merchandise to our department stores through our distribution centers located in Jacksonville, Texas and Jeffersonville, Ohio and to our Gordmans off-price stores through our distribution center in Omaha, Nebraska. E-commerce orders are predominantly filled from our distribution center in Jacksonville, Texas and to a lesser extent, from select stores and directly from our vendors. We contract with third-party carriers to deliver merchandise to our stores and to our guests in the fulfillment of online orders. Guests also have the option to pick up an online order in a local store through our Buy Online, Ship-to-Store program.
See Item 2, “Properties,” for additional information about our distribution centers.
Marketing 
We use a multi-media advertising approach, including digital and mobile, broadcast, direct mail, and to a lesser degree, newspaper inserts. In 2018, our efforts to shift our marketing focus to digital media resulted in a 16% increase in digital and mobile spend, with offsetting reductions in direct mail and newspaper inserts. 
Our department stores and off-price stores are similar in many respects. However, our department stores offer deeper, more curated assortments with sales driven by high-low pricing promotions, value coupons and advice from knowledgeable associates. Conversely, our off-price stores offer a varied assortment of every day value pricing in a treasure-hunt environment with sales driven by calendar events such as holidays, back-to-school, graduations, birthdays, anniversaries and more. 
Our private label credit card and loyalty program, Style Circle Rewards®, are integral to the value proposition for our guests. These programs allow us to better understand and respond to our guests’ shopping habits and are powerful tools to drive higher transaction value and frequency of visits. On average, private label credit cardholders and loyalty members spend more annually and are less likely to attrite than non-loyalty guests. In our department stores, private label credit card purchases represented 48% of our sales in 2018. In our off-price stores, we acquired a historically underpenetrated private label credit card program in 2017 and implemented best practices developed in our department stores, which we expect to continue to drive future growth. Private label credit card purchases represented 14% of our off-price store sales in 2018. We ended 2018 with nearly 10 million members under our loyalty programs. 
Trademarks
Our principal trademarks, including the BEALLS, GOODY’S, PALAIS ROYAL, PEEBLES, STAGE and GORDMANS nameplates, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered trademarks used in connection with our loyalty program. We regard our trademarks and their protection as important to our success. We also hold the domain names Stage.com and Gordmans.com.

Our Employees
At February 2, 2019, we employed approximately 13,600 full-time and part-time employees, referred to as “associates.” Employment levels vary during the year as we traditionally hire additional sales associates and increase the hours of part-time sales associates during peak seasonal selling periods. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our associates. Eligibility for and the level of benefits vary depending on associates' full-time or part-time status, compensation level, date of hire and/or length of service. Company-paid benefits include a 401(k) plan, deferred compensation plans, medical and dental plans, disability insurance, paid vacation, life insurance and merchandise discounts. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and there are no collective bargaining agreements in effect with respect to any of our associates. 
Seasonality
Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters. Because of the seasonality of our business, results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
