ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We are an enterprise organized for the purpose of searching for, documenting and collecting evidence of the existence of the creature known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch, according to North American folklore, and, in direct connection with this purpose we develop and produce and distribute fictional and documentary films about the creature and our searches.
 
In addition to our films, available on DVD we have added T-shirts and other “branded” products such as decals, coffee mugs, skull caps, and ball caps to our inventory. We have developed artwork which wraps around the travel trailer we use for search expeditions, further increasing the extent to which our Company and logo can be recognized.
 
Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 30, 2011. Pursuant to a purchase agreement, effective January 13, 2013, Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. acquired all the assets of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., a Nevada corporation, for four million four hundred thousand (4,400,000) shares of common stock and a promissory note was issued to the two majority shareholders of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. in the aggregate amount of $484,039. Searching for Bigfoot Inc. was formed for the purpose of researching the existence of Bigfoot, which has financed research and expeditions throughout the United States and Canada.
 
Formed as a simple organization with the intent of raising funds to produce a movie for distribution, “Searching for Bigfoot Inc.” evolved such that it built significant value in video/film footage, materials, artifacts, and relationships with organizations interested in Bigfoot’s existence around the country. In January 2019, the Company reinstated the subsidiary known as Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as an operating subsidiary of Bigfoot Project Investments Inc.
 
When a decision was made to pursue the opportunity to produce and distribute films as an ongoing business venture, a management team was brought together to form an entertainment investment corporation that would aim to capitalize on both current and future investment projects related to Bigfoot. We intend to create entertainment properties surrounding the mythology and research of Bigfoot, as well as potentially finding Bigfoot.
 
We intend to become an entertainment investment company, where our competitive advantage is our developed knowledge base and the advanced level of maturity of our projects. We intend to capitalize on our current inventory of projects; allowing our company to continue creation of media properties and the establishment of physical locations, partnerships and alliances with organizations to augment investment markets to create revenue as a stand-alone enterprise.

The inventory of the Company’s projects currently consists of nine films which are being marketed to both DVD and Video On Demand (VOD) through domestic and international distribution markets. Additionally, preliminary investment plans are being negotiated for a 3D Movie with a movie production company. Foreign distribution markets have recently become available and our contracted marketing company, The Bosko Group, is in the process of negotiating contracts for all nine DVD films, which include the movies being subtitled and dubbed in foreign languages throughout Europe, Asia and South America. Currently, we are represented by our contracted marketing distributor, The Bosko Group, in which they represent and sell the rights for the Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. nine DVD Movies.
 
Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. entered into two separate agreements with its distributor The Bosko Group in May 2017. One agreement is for the re-release of seven of the Company’s documentaries with new introductions and commentaries. The other agreement is for the production of five new feature length films depicting the “Dark and Violent” world of Bigfoot. The first in the series “Brutal Bigfoot” was released August 29th, 2018 and has received mixed reviews on the Amazon.com distributor site.
 
We plan to continue to amass artifacts (footprint castings, skeletal, hair, skin, blood and other creature remains), and media products such as DVD videos, photographs, audio and Written documents, televised, and movie media events from our continued Bigfoot expeditions throughout the United States and Canada. We will use the artifacts we currently have and the artifacts we intend to acquire. The collection of artifacts is used as scientific evidence to substantiate the existence of this creature known as “Bigfoot” as a species through proper DNA testing and scientific examination. The artifacts are provided to the scientific community as evidence in documentation of this creature as a new species. This documentation is used in media projects (television, DVD movies, publications etc.) for marketing and management believes the artifacts have substantial value. Media products such as DVD videos, photographs, audio and written documents, televised, and movie media events from our continued Bigfoot expeditions provide the basis for our media projects, which are marketed and provide revenue. Additionally, we will negotiate and purchase intellectual and physical properties relating to the creature as opportunities become available that will continue to feed the development of additional projects.
 
Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. bears a high degree of risk, lacking maturity and not having a background or reference point to evaluate or compare company performance to the investor. Each of the projects we market will be carefully reviewed for its projected market value by the Company’s Board of Directors. These Projects will be based on agreements with property owners of other organizations. Personnel in each project area will share in the responsibility running our company’s operations.
 
Change of Control
 
On November 13, 2019, the majority shareholder and CEO of the Company signed a Definitive Share Purchase Agreement (“Agreement”) in which Tom Biscardi sold 100% of the issued and outstanding Preferred Series A stock to Joseph Cellura and 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock to Lord Global Corporation. The Agreement outlines specific legal agreements that will be executed in addition to the exchange of stock. The specified legal agreements are currently in negotiations and will be executed as the terms are finalized. The current Board of Directors will resign and be replaced during this process.
Employees
 
Currently, we have no full-time employees other than our officers and directors. The directors are elected on an annual basis. The Company does not compensate the officers or directors for their service. We anticipate that we will be unable to hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we begin to generate significant revenues. Meanwhile, we intend to utilize outsourcing quality personnel in conjunction with the talents of our current officers and directors.
