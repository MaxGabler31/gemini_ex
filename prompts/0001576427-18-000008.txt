Item 1.    Business 
History and Development of the Company
Criteo S.A. was initially incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée, or S.A.S., under the laws of the French Republic on November 3, 2005, for a period of 99 years and subsequently converted to a société anonyme, or S.A. We are registered at the Paris Commerce and Companies Register under the number 484 786 249. Our agent for service of process in the United States is National Registered Agents, Inc. We began selling elements of our offering in France in 2007 and have since expanded our business into other countries in Western Europe. In 2009, we expanded our business into North America and entered the Asia-Pacific region in late 2010. In November 2016, we acquired HookLogic, Inc. ("HookLogic"), a New York-based company that has developed a performance marketing exchange connecting consumer brand manufacturers with retail ecommerce sites via sponsored product ads sold by ecommerce retailers. We now offer HookLogic's products under the "Criteo Sponsored Products" name. 
Business Overview 
We are a global commerce marketing technology company. We help commerce companies and brand manufacturers acquire, convert and re-engage their customers, using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach. We strive to deliver post-click sales at scale to our clients across different marketing objectives to meet their targeted return on investment. Our data is pooled among our clients and offers deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits. To drive sales for our clients, we activate our data assets through proprietary machine-learning algorithms to engage consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements, across devices and environments. By pricing our offering on a cost-per-click and measuring our value based on post-click sales, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for our clients.
Our vision is to build the highest performing and open Commerce Marketing Ecosystem, by connecting shoppers to the things they need and love, and by delivering the highest performance to the commerce companies and brand manufacturers who participate in our ecosystem.
For the past twelve years, we have built our market position by focusing on three pillars: actionable commerce data, predictive technology to activate the data and generate sales, and large consumer reach. We continuously improve our technology and broaden our reach, and recently introduced Criteo Shopper Graph, a highly differentiated group of data collectives built through collaboration and data pooling within our open ecosystem of commerce and brand clients. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one of the world's biggest and most open data sets focused on shoppers.
Our clients include some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world, along with world-class brand manufacturers. We partner with them to capture activity on their websites and/or mobile applications, which we define as digital properties, and optimize the performance of their advertisements based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $615 billion in online sales transactions1 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2017, whether or not a consumer saw or clicked on an advertisement displayed by Criteo. Based on this data and our other assets, we delivered targeted advertisements that generated over 10 billion clicks1 in the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on these clicks, our clients generated approximately $29 billion in post-click sales1 during this period. A post-click sale is defined as a purchase made by a user from one of our clients' digital properties within a certain period of time following the user clicking on an advertisement we delivered for that client. This period of time varies by client, but is a maximum of 30 days. We believe post-click sales are a key performance indicator that our clients generally use to measure the effectiveness of our offering in driving sales and the return on their marketing investment. As of December 31, 2017, we served more than 18,000 clients and, in each of the last three years, our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%1.

Each day we are presented with billions of opportunities to connect consumers with relevant marketing messages from our commerce and brand clients. For each of these opportunities, our algorithms analyze massive volumes of data to observe and predict consumer intent and deliver specific messaging for products or services that are likely to engage that particular consumer and generate a sale for our client. The accuracy of our algorithms improves with every advertisement we deliver, as they incorporate new data, while continuing to learn from prior interactions.
The Criteo model is focused on performance, enabling us to charge our clients only when users engage with an advertisement we deliver, usually by clicking on it. In contrast, most traditional display solutions charge clients when an advertisement is displayed, whether or not the unit is seen or clicked on. Our pay-for-performance pricing model clearly links the cost of a marketing campaign to its effectiveness in driving sales, and is valued as such by our clients. 
As commerce companies and brand manufacturers have embraced our offering, we have achieved significant growth since our inception and are now operating across 98 countries. Our revenue retention rate was 138%, 120% and 115% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.1 We define our revenue retention rate as (i) revenue recognized during a period from clients that contributed to revenue recognized in the prior corresponding period divided by (ii) total revenue recognized in such prior corresponding period. In our view, consistently having over 75% of our Revenue ex-TAC generated from clients that have uncapped budgets directly contributes to our ability to maintain a high level of revenue retention. As a result, our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing clients is a useful indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships.
Our financial results include:

• | revenue of $1,323.2 million, $1,799.1 million and $2,296.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively;


• | revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs, which we refer to as Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $534.0 million, $730.2 million and $941.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively;


• | net income of $62.3 million, $87.3 million and $96.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively; and


• | Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $143.4 million, $224.6 million and $309.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Please see footnotes 3 and 5 to the "Other Financial and Operating Data" table in "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC to revenue, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and Adjusted Net Income to net income, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or "U.S. GAAP".

Our technology is optimized to deliver post-click sales at scale to clients in four key steps:

• | First, we capture the buying intent of individual shoppers, directly from the online stores and product catalogs of our clients' digital properties, to feed our technology platform. In addition, we may collect user technical identifier data from our clients, such as hashed customer logins and/or hashed emails. Before collecting such commerce and identifier data, we seek permission from our clients to pool some of this collected data with other clients who also provide permission for the use of some of their own data.


• | Second, our proprietary technology sequentially performs the following steps in real time:


▪ | Recommends the right product or service to offer to that user, based on the shopping intent data collected for that user and other statistically relevant data points;


▪ | Predicts the individual value of that user for our client, whose product or service is being offered in the advertisement, in order to bid the appropriate price for the advertising inventory on which our advertisement will be displayed; and


▪ | Creates a customized advertisement using optimized creative elements in line with our client's branding guidelines.


• | Third, we deliver the personalized advertisement to the user across a wide range of inventory available to us through customized technical integrations and advertisement serving capabilities with publisher partners.


• | Fourth, we measure in real time the success of the advertisement and make this performance information available to our clients through our client platform.

The process leading up to the delivery of the advertisement can be executed in under 100 milliseconds and, throughout the entire process, our technology monitors and adjusts each of these steps through a real-time feedback loop to optimize performance at all times and better inform existing and future campaigns.

The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem
Our technology and ecosystem are optimized for commerce marketing. While pricing our offering on a cost-per-click basis, we generate post-click sales for our commerce and brand clients by efficiently and effectively targeting, engaging and converting their shoppers.
Criteo technology addresses the entire consumer journey (customer acquisition, conversion and re-engagement) and works seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), digital environments (web and mobile applications), platforms and operating systems, marketing channels (Display Advertising, including social and native, video, and sponsored products advertisements on retailers' websites) and publisher networks (Alphabet Inc. ("Google"), Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") and thousands of publishers and mobile application developers in the open web). The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem, as we define it, is available as a unique and comprehensive offering and cannot be broken down and purchased as separate services, except for individual products.
The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem is comprised of:

• | Criteo Shopper Graph


• | The Criteo Engine


• | Our publisher network


• | Our client platform


• | Our product portfolio

Criteo Shopper Graph
Through integration with substantially all of our clients' digital properties, we obtain large volumes of browsing behavior data, expressed consumer shopping intent, engagement behavior and transactional data at the individual product and individual user level.
Our data assets include our clients' proprietary commerce data, such as transaction activity on their digital properties, representing over $615 billion in online sales in 20171.

Access to high quality data assets fuels the accuracy of our algorithms, which improves with the increasing quantity and quality of data we obtain from our clients and publisher partners, as well as insights gained through our own extensive operational history. The combination of these three data sets gives us powerful insights into consumer purchasing habits that we use to price inventory and create the most relevant advertisements to drive user engagement and ultimately generate sales for our clients. In addition to commerce data at the granular product level, we seek to use as much information as possible about the context and intent of a given user, collected from clients and publisher partners, to further refine our prediction accuracy.
We believe our access to highly granular commerce data validates the trust that our clients place in us. For example, for most of our clients, we typically have real-time access to the products or services a shopper has viewed, researched or bought from them and we continuously receive updated information on 4.5 billion products or services, including pricing, images and descriptions, which is typically characterized as non-Personally Identifiable Information (or Non-PII). A growing number of our clients also provide us with the purchase history data of their shoppers in formats that are non-PII.
Using cookies and non-cookie based technologies, we collect information about the interaction of users with our clients' and publishers' digital properties. Our clients grant us access to their valuable data through direct integration with us, which requires our clients to place Criteo software code throughout their digital properties. The information we collect does not enable us to personally identify the particular user. 
Over the past few years, we have built three data collectives through data pooling among our clients. The combination of these three data collectives forms the Criteo Shopper Graph. With these data collectives, we ask our clients to grant us the permission to share a significant portion of their proprietary data with other clients who also contribute data to this specific collective data pool. With Criteo Shopper Graph, we intend to build one of the world's largest and most open data sets focused on shoppers and their commerce activity. 
Criteo Shopper Graph is comprised of the following three data collectives:

• | The Identity Graph allows us to match user technical identifiers across devices and environments, including online and offline. As of December 31, 2017, 79% of our clients grant us access to some of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) data, such as hashed customer logins and/or hashed emails, to enable us to match users across multiple digital devices or environments. As of December 31, 2017, we had matched 3.7 billion user IDs globally, with an average of three user IDs per individual user. The scope of our Identity Graph is already among the best in the industry, with matching rates, in some markets, that we believe are similar to, if not higher than, Google's and Facebook's2. In addition, the Identity graph allows us to leverage offline CRM data of our clients' physical stores, to match it with online user profiles, based on their offline shopping history. Since the end of 2015, the Identity Graph has seen strong traction within our client base and we believe it has become a solid foundation to reach customers across all devices and environments. The Identity Graph supports and benefits all our products.


• | The Interest Map collects and organizes customer intent and purchasing data across the products available in our commerce clients network, in order to build a comprehensive and accurate shopper profile for all customers on whom we have collected data. We collect data on over $615 billion in online sales3 and, every year, we see close to 8 billion shopping transactions that take place within our commerce ecosystem3. With the Interest Map, we seek our clients' permission to use their data to power products that are jointly used by the collective. In the fourth quarter 2017, eligible clients that give us permission to share their customers' shopping intent data and purchase history within the Interest Map represented 43% of Revenue ex-TAC. We are building applications for the Interest Map, as well as its underlying infrastructure, including the Universal Catalog, a unified view of the 4.5 billion individual products available across the combined product catalogs of our commerce clients. The Interest Map is a key foundation to build and develop compelling commerce marketing products, such as Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA for engaging new prospective customers.


• | The Measurement Network provides SKU-level sales attribution for brand manufacturers across our network of retailer partners that use Criteo Sponsored Products. This means that, using our deterministic measurement approach, our brand clients using Criteo Sponsored Products can precisely track and measure the effectiveness of their marketing spend by attributing their sales at the SKU level to the clicks that were generated on their advertisements across our network of retailers. This permission-based sales attribution, retailer by retailer, is typically not available to brand manufacturers in the offline world, where they still place most of their trade marketing investments. While we plan to widen the Measurement Network to all Criteo retailers with new applications, we are also beginning to add offline sales attribution for brand manufacturers.

The design and governance of the Criteo Shopper Graph are based on four differentiated guiding principles:

• | Openness: we commit to a two-way exchange of data with our clients, whereby all clients who contribute data can access the collective dataset, as well as relevant cross-device user IDs and campaign Key Performance Indicators to better inform and optimize their marketing, in return for their contribution.


• | Transparency: our clients' contribution and sharing of data within the data pools are based on a clear and permission-based usage by Criteo for the mutual benefits of all participants in the ecosystem.


• | Security: as always, we apply the highest data security and user privacy standards to our three data collectives.


• | Fairness: the data collectives are designed and governed in ways such that the value gained by clients participating largely exceeds their individual contribution to the collectives.

The Criteo Engine 
The Criteo Engine has been developed over the past 12 years and consists of multiple machine learning algorithms, and the proprietary global hardware and software infrastructure that enables the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem to operate in real time at significant scale. 
The Criteo Engine leverages our vast and high-quality data assets, with the goal of maximizing consumer engagement and conversion through the delivery of highly relevant and personalized advertisements in real time.
The Criteo Engine consists of:

• | Recommendation algorithms. These algorithms create advertisements tailored to specific customer interest by determining the specific products and services to include in the advertisement. These products and services may be ones that the customer has already been exposed to, or that the algorithms predict the customer could be interested in. Alternatively, these may be products and services that other customers exposed to some of the same products and services, have been interested in. Since our acquisition of HookLogic, Inc. and the launch of Criteo Sponsored Products, we have also made investments in this Engine feature to improve product recommendation on retailer sites.


• | Predictive bidding algorithms. These algorithms predict the probability and nature of a user's engagement with a given advertisement. Such user engagement can take the form, for example, of clicks, conversions, shopping basket value, specific product categories purchased, or even the gross margin of the purchased product or service that our client generates from such purchase. This prediction of engagement incorporates data from our clients, publishers and third-party sources, including user intent, who the client is, the products offered by the client, as well as data on the creative content of the advertisement and the publisher context in which the advertisement is viewed. Together with our recommendation algorithms, the prediction algorithms allow us to determine the most appropriate price to pay for an advertising impression, based on an individual user's predicted click-through, conversion and the dollar value of that conversion, what the client is willing to pay for that engagement, as well as Criteo's own target Revenue ex-TAC margin from placing the advertisement. Our bidding engine executes campaigns based on certain objectives set by our clients (for example, cost-per-click, cost-per-order, cost-of-sales, budget goal). After a bid for an advertising impression is placed and won, the Criteo Engine assembles and delivers individualized advertisements and provides campaign reporting, all in near-real time.


• | Kinetic Design. Based on the results of our algorithms, the Criteo Engine automatically and dynamically assembles customized creative advertising content on an impression-by-impression basis in real time, by optimizing each individual creative component in the advertisement, from the font, color, size and format of product images to the "call to action" or price discount. Our patented Kinetic Design creative technology offers virtually unlimited personalization, with up to 17 trillion visual ad variations, without the need to define advertisement sizes or layouts upfront, while maintaining the consistency of our clients' brand image.


• | Software systems and processes. Our algorithms are supported by robust software infrastructure that allows us to operate seamlessly at a very large scale. The architecture and processing capabilities of this technology have been designed to match the massive computational demands and complexity of our algorithms. This technology enables data synchronization, storage and analysis across a large-scale distributed computing infrastructure in multiple geographies, as well as fast data collection and retrieval using multi-layered caching infrastructure.

• | Experimentation platform. This online/offline platform is used to improve the capabilities and effectiveness of our prediction models by measuring the correlation of specific parameters with user engagement, usually measured by clicks and conversions, typically in the form of sales. A dedicated team is constantly testing new types and data sources to determine whether they help diminish the gap between predicted click-through and conversion, and actual click-through and conversion over the course of a live campaign.

A key attribute of the Criteo Engine is the vast metadata of commerce marketing learning that we have accumulated from having delivered and measured responses to over 4.7 trillion advertising impressions since inception. 
In addition, we have long established Privacy-by-design as a central element of our technology and product design, with a strong commitment to ensuring best practices in privacy, security and safety for consumers and our commerce and brand clients. We have had a designated Data Privacy Officer since 2013 along with a team of privacy experts. These experts are part of the R&D and Product organization and consider all facets of user privacy as key elements in the design of any new product or feature of the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem. They also perform ongoing Privacy Impact Assessments to monitor potential risks during the product lifecycle and proactively mitigate those risks. The Data Privacy team delivers company-wide privacy training, enforces our privacy policies and is integral to ensuring that we build the best products and services. We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary and enforce these policies with our clients, publisher partners and vendors.
Our Publisher Network
We benefit from broad real-time access to inventory through our direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners. We define inventory as the combination of desktop web, mobile in-web and mobile in-app Display Advertising impressions, including social and native display inventory; video inventory; and inventory for sponsored products advertisements on major retail ecommerce sites. 
Through our relationships with thousands of direct publisher partners and with real-time bidding, or "RTB," Display Advertising exchanges, we provide extensive access to advertising inventory. In some cases, we have negotiated direct and privileged access with publishers, giving us the opportunity to select, buy and price, on an impression-per-impression basis and in real time: (1) inventory that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments; and/or (2) particular advertising impressions before such impressions are made available to other potential buyers. We believe that many of our direct publisher partners have granted us preferred access to portions of their inventory as a result of our ability to effectively monetize that inventory. For example, in Japan, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, that grants us privileged access to its advertising inventory for delivering personalized display advertisements. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we access inventory from retail ecommerce sites that is generally not available to traditional advertising demand. This sponsored product inventory from ecommerce retailers is a valuable source of inventory for brand manufacturers looking to advertise their products on a performance basis in a multi-brand retail environment.
We price and buy inventory in real time and typically do not pre-buy any impression, and do not commit to buying any minimum volume of impressions, except in some limited specific cases involving publishers using Criteo Sponsored Products. Across both our direct publisher relationships and inventory purchasing done on RTB exchanges, we leverage the Criteo Engine's ability to quickly and accurately value available advertising inventory, and utilize that information to bid for inventory on a programmatic, automated basis. 
For Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA and Criteo Audience Match BETA, we purchase inventory programmatically from our direct publisher partners, through standard terms and conditions for the purchase of Display Advertising inventory. Pursuant to such arrangements, we purchase impressions on a CPM basis (or cost-per-thousand-impressions) for potential customers that Criteo recognizes on the publishers' digital properties. This means that inventory purchased for Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA and Criteo Audience Match BETA is paid to the publisher irrespective of whether the user engages with the advertisement delivered on that publisher's digital property. Such arrangements are cancellable upon short notice and without penalty. 
For Criteo Sponsored Products, we pay for the inventory of publisher partners based on a revenue share, effectively paying the publishers a portion of the click-based revenue generated by potential customers clicking on the sponsored products advertisements displaying the products of our brand clients. This means that, with Criteo Sponsored Products, the publishers only get paid if a user effectively clicks on the advertisement that is displayed on their digital property.

Alongside our existing technologies to integrate directly with publishers, we have developed the Criteo Direct Bidder, our new generation header bidding technology. In recent years, the publisher landscape has rapidly transitioned towards header bidding technology, allowing publishers to make their inventory simultaneously available for public auction to several competitive bidders, including RTB exchanges. Header bidding replaces a previous auction structure, whereby a publisher's inventory was made available sequentially to auctioneers in a so-called "waterfall" priority system. Thanks to our large scale, Criteo Direct Bidder allows us to connect directly to the ad server of publishers in situations where publishers use header bidding to monetize their inventory, thereby allowing us to by-pass RTB exchanges in the bidding process. Using Criteo Direct Bidder, we were connected to 1,500 large publishers globally as of December 31, 2017, including among others The Weather Channel, Daily Mail, The Washington Post, eBay, Orange, Viber, Axel Springer's websites and the LA Times. Criteo Direct Bidder has been positively received by publishers, helping them to increase the average monetization of their inventory monetized by Criteo by 20% to 40%, relative to our overall spend through all channels1.
We believe that our ability to efficiently access and value inventory at scale results in a deeply liquid marketplace for both buyers and sellers of Display Advertising, allowing us to deliver effective advertisements at the right price for our clients, even as the size and complexity of the campaign increases.
We take a variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved at all times. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to mitigate the risk that their display advertisements are shown in inappropriate content categories, such as in adult, violent or political content. For that purpose, we use numerous internal systems and processes to filter out inventory in real time, including the list of suspect IP addresses from the Trustworthy Accountability Group and the lists of invalid traffic from several specialized external vendors. With respect to our inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize a mix of proprietary methodologies as well as third-party software to verify that inventory where the advertisement placement is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our clients. In addition, we are an active member of the Coalition for Better Ads, supported by Google, and are compliant with their recommendations for the most user-friendly advertising formats.
Client Platform
We offer our clients an integrated technology platform that provides comprehensive visibility and detailed transparency on their campaigns across the consumer journey. This platform enables campaign execution and management through a unified and easy-to-use dashboard and a suite of software and services that automates key campaign processes. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and having to use multiple vendors of commerce marketing products, delivering efficiencies across the consumer journey, even as campaigns grow in size, complexity and product mix.
The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem includes a comprehensive suite of services and software, including:

• | A unified and transparent dashboard to manage campaigns, product by product. This dashboard automates a number of campaign execution and management tasks. Key attributes of the dashboard include:


▪ | easy-to-use interface;


▪ | 24/7 availability;


▪ | granular control, with the ability to specify, for each Criteo product, the CPC that the client is ready to bid on at its own product category level;


▪ | transparent and detailed reporting of key campaign metrics, such as CPCs, impressions served, effective cost per thousand impressions, or eCPM, click-through rate and post-click sales; and


▪ | transparent standard reports that clients can download through the Criteo API, showing detailed impression-level information4, including: publisher domains where their advertisements are shown, time stamps of displayed advertisements and the value of each impression. We believe that more transparency increases the confidence our clients have in Criteo, and further strengthens our relationship with them.

• | Business intelligence and analytics. Included in our client service, we provide high-value consulting services to our larger clients through a team of advisers that aid them in setting goals for, extracting insights from, and evaluating trends and performance of their marketing campaigns across different marketing objectives, sources of inventory supply, marketing channels, and the multiple digital devices that customers may use.

In parallel with accessing transparent performance reporting from the Criteo Client Platform, a large proportion of our clients regularly use their own attribution tools and solutions (such as GoogleTM Analytics, IBM Coremetrics® or Adobe® Analytics) to independently measure and assess the performance of the post-click sales delivered by Criteo.
Our Commerce Marketing Product Portfolio
We offer four products focused on driving sales for our clients.
All our products are priced on a cost per click basis, which means that we only get paid when a user engages with our advertisements. For all of our products, our clients generally measure performance based on post-click sales.

• | Criteo Dynamic Retargeting drives post-click sales for our commerce clients by engaging consumers with personalized advertisements offering products or services for which they have already expressed shopping intent.


• | Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA drives post-click sales for our commerce clients by helping them to acquire new prospective customers, using intent information across a large pool of clients and engaging such prospective customers with personalized advertisements offering products or services that are predicted to be of interest to them.


• | Criteo Audience Match BETA drives more post-click sales for our commerce clients by accurately targeting and re-engaging their existing customers with personalized advertisements offering new products or services that they have not yet purchased.


• | Criteo Sponsored Products drives post-click sales for our brand clients by pricing and delivering in real time sponsored product advertisements to consumers demonstrating intent, or actively searching for a specific product or product category, on the websites of retailers selling such brand product.

With our product portfolio, we help our clients cover the entire consumer journey: acquiring new prospective customers, converting them into buyers and regularly re-engaging them across the customer lifetime.
Excluding our core product, Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, no other product accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated revenue for the periods presented.
Industry Background
The ability to engage and convert customers is critical for most companies, especially for businesses in the broader commerce and consumer brand sectors, who often dedicate a significant portion of their cost base to developing such an ability. 
Ecommerce is Growing Fast But Physical Stores Remain Key Assets for Retailers.
The global retail commerce market is massive in size, representing $22.7 trillion in 2017, and is expected to continue to grow by a 5% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, to $26.5 trillion in 2020, according to eMarketer. While business-to-consumer ecommerce is growing much faster than global commerce (by a 17.2% CAGR, from $2.9 trillion in 2017 to $4.7 trillion in 2020, according to eMarketer), retail ecommerce still represents a fairly limited share of overall retail commerce (growing from 10.1% in 2017 to 14.6% in 2020 according to eMarketer). This means that, despite the rapid growth of ecommerce, physical stores still capture approximately 90% of the global retail commerce market and remain key assets for retail commerce companies looking to offer differentiated services to consumers while distributing their products.

Display Advertising Grows Faster than Search Advertising But Faces Challenges for Broad-Based Performance Marketing.
While the internet and mobile devices continue to be critical to generating customer engagement and driving sales, both online and offline, they remain fragmented and complex marketing platforms, making it difficult and costly to engage and convert prospective customers. For example, the global cart abandonment rate, or the percentage of online customers leaving their order behind instead of purchasing, was 75.6% in the first quarter 2017 according to SaleCycle, including 72.8% in the Retail vertical and 81.7% in the Travel vertical. 
There are two primary marketing channels for customer engagement and conversion in the digital space: Search Advertising and Display Advertising. According to eMarketer, digital marketers spent $185 billion on paid Search Advertising and Display Advertising combined in 2017, with this combined spend, defined as Digital Marketing, expected to grow at a 10.3% CAGR to $249 billion in 2020.
Display Advertising involves placing images, video or advertisements that incorporate animation, sound and/or interactivity, alongside website and mobile application content. According to eMarketer, Display Advertising, including on social media, represented 52% of the Digital Marketing market, or $97 billion in 2017, and is projected to grow at a 12.2% CAGR to $137 billion in 2020. The market for Display Advertising is more fragmented and is projected to grow over 50% faster than the market for Search Advertising, due in part to the rapid rise of mobile internet usage and the continued proliferation of free content across the internet, including on social media platforms.
The market for Display Advertising is growing fast but continues to face a number of significant challenges as an effective intent-driven medium for customer engagement and conversion, including:
Still Difficult to Deliver Targeted, Relevant Ads. In general, traditional Display Advertising solutions have incorporated limited personalization capabilities and have not been effective in utilizing consumer intent as a signal for the delivery of advertisements. As a result, targeting and messaging have mainly been done by buying advertising impressions for generic audiences and placing generic advertisements alongside certain types of content (e.g., non-personalized automotive advertisements on sites related to cars), without incorporating purchase intent or interests. These traditional campaigns often lack relevance and, as a consequence, result in limited user engagement and conversion.
Difficult to Deliver Performance at Scale. Many Display Advertising solutions are unable to sustain performance for larger campaigns or longer trials due in part to the highly fragmented nature of the Display Advertising landscape, increasing amounts of data and lack of robust technology. Therefore, the challenges described above are amplified for larger and more complex campaigns.
Pricing Disconnected from Performance. Display Advertising inventory has historically been sold on a cost-per-impression, or CPM, basis, meaning that an advertiser is charged each time an advertisement is displayed, whether or not a user has effectively seen or interacted with the advertisement. This makes it difficult for advertisers to determine the true cost of an advertising campaign and evaluate the relationship of that cost to the effectiveness of the campaign in driving engagement and sales. Today, the pricing models generally available in the Display Advertising market include the cost-per-action, or CPA, pricing model, where an advertiser is charged when a user takes a specific action; and hybrid pricing models, which reflect a combination of one or more of the CPM, CPC and CPA models. While Search Advertising inventory is generally priced on a CPC model, we believe Display Advertising inventory has generally been and continues to be largely priced on a CPM basis and, as a result, does not offer a clear performance-based pricing to marketers.
Inefficient Campaign Execution. Deployment of Display Advertising campaigns can be inefficient and costly. Traditional solutions are often a combination of many point solutions, requiring businesses to connect and manage multiple intermediaries and complex elements of the advertising campaign execution process, including media planning, data management and analysis, targeting, creative assembly, media buying, optimization, advertisement serving and reporting. In addition, meaningful portions of campaign planning, execution and management remain highly manual.
Lack of Performance-Based Advertising Options for Brand Manufacturers. Brand manufacturers, who usually do not directly sell their products online via their own ecommerce store, face a number of significant challenges when attempting to invest in performance-based digital advertising outside of Search Advertising to engage customers and drive sales. Among such challenges is a very limited number of options to advertise their products on a performance basis via Display Advertising campaigns and to get a clear and measurable view of how such advertising campaigns drive their sales.

Increasing Complexity and Fragmentation of the Path to Purchase. The consumer path to purchase has become complex and highly fragmented as shoppers move across multiple digital devices and platforms, from the initial intent to buy a product, to engaging with an advertisement and finally purchasing the product. It is therefore critical for marketers willing to use Display Advertising to drive sales that such marketing campaigns be developed and executed across all devices and environments. 
Four Trends Point to Digital Display Advertising Reaching an Inflection Point in Driving More Sales for Marketers
We believe that, over the past few years, Display Advertising has reached an inflection point, becoming both a brand building medium and a more effective engagement and conversion channel. Four trends are driving this transformation:
Mobile and Cross-Device Commerce. Penetration of smartphones and tablets is driving rapid growth of global mobile commerce. Mobile commerce represented $1.4 trillion globally in 2017, and is expected to grow at a 29% CAGR between 2017 and 2020, according to eMarketer. In parallel, consumers increasingly use multiple devices to shop across ecommerce websites and mobile applications. As a result, we believe that transactions involving the use of multiple devices, referred to as "cross-device" transactions, represent between 40% and 50% of ecommerce, growing much faster than ecommerce.
Programmatic Buying. Technologies for more automated and efficient buying and selling of Display Advertising have been gaining traction for several years with both advertising buyers and publishers. Programmatic buying from real-time, automated bidding platforms and exchanges, as well as through relationships with publishers, provides advertisers with dynamic, targeted and efficient ways to access the proper inventory, and helps publishers maximize the value of their inventory. Worldwide spending in programmatic Display Advertising is expected to grow from $58 billion in 2017 to $85 billion in 2019 according to Zenith Optimedia, representing a CAGR of 21%.
Machine Learning. According to IDC Research, from now until 2020, the digital information universe is expected to double in size every two years. The large and diverse data sets that make up this digital information, often referred to as big data, are generally categorized into: business application data, human-generated content and machine data. New computational approaches and the falling costs of computing power enable technology companies to process and draw insights from this data using machine-learning approaches. These insights can be used to optimize Display Advertising campaigns in ways that were not previously possible. The ability to collect, collate and analyze shopping intent data points using machine-learning technology, is becoming a key differentiator for advertisers, including brand manufacturers.
Increasing Willingness from Commerce Companies and Brands to Share Data Within Collectives. We believe that brand manufacturers and retailers not only realize the strong potential of their commerce data, but also increasingly view collaboration and pooled data as key assets in order to better meet customers' needs, drive value for their business and better compete in today's environment. According to a study published by Forbes Insights in collaboration with Criteo in October 2017, 71% of retailers are willing to contribute online product searches data to a pool5. 60% of surveyed retailers are already part of a data cooperative, with almost 70% of those companies already pleased with their collaboration as well as the data they receive. Additionally, 72% of marketers cite "increased revenue" as a key benefit they experience from pooled data.
The Rise of Commerce Marketing Provides Significant Opportunities for Commerce Companies and Brand Manufacturers
In today's highly competitive environment, commerce companies and brand manufacturers increasingly focus on profitably engaging and converting their customers. To achieve this, they need a marketing partner who effectively capitalizes on large amounts of consumer intent and identification data and has the ability to activate this dataset through machine-learning technology, to drive measurable sales at scale across digital devices and environments.
Building on the four trends discussed above, we believe Commerce Marketing is quickly emerging as the next big marketing category. We define Commerce Marketing as the category of marketing that directly drives sales and profits from shoppers, unlike other forms of marketing that focus on media consumption and rely on objectives such as awareness, reach and engagement. 

• | Commerce Marketing is not limited to digital. While many marketing channels, including Search Advertising and Social Platforms, are more naturally digital-native, Commerce Marketing has the potential to be the category where physical and digital converge, enabling retailers who operate physical stores, that provide valuable commerce data assets, to leverage their offline presence to drive sales online and vice versa.

11


• | Commerce Marketing centers on inspiring people to buy things. Unlike Search Advertising, which focuses on finding relevant information, and Social Platforms, which are all about connecting people, the sole focus of Commerce Marketing is inspiring consumers to purchase products using data to deliver relevant ads tailored to their interests and needs.


• | Commerce Marketing is measured by performance, directly driving sales and profits. Unlike all other marketing categories, Commerce Marketing is solely measured by the sales and corresponding profits it is driving for marketers through personalized campaigns at the individual user and individual product level.

We believe our large network of retailers provides us with a key role as an aggregator for the online retail industry. 
We believe that Commerce Marketing is at the junction of Commerce Sales, Digital Marketing and CRM technology, supported by massive growth in big data and machine-learning capabilities6. As a result, we believe the following market dynamics will continue to support the growth in Commerce Marketing:

• | Global retail commerce will represent sales of $26.5 trillion by 2020, including $4.7 trillion in global retail ecommerce, growing by 17% CAGR, according to eMarketer.


• | Digital Marketing will grow 10% CAGR to represent $270 billion by 2020, including 12% CAGR to $137 billion for Display Advertising, according to eMarketer.


• | Sales of CRM software will grow 14% CAGR to represent $39 billion by 2021, according to Gartner.

We see Commerce Marketing as a powerful marketing category for marketers seeking to maximize customer engagement and conversion from current and past shoppers at scale. With marketers focused more and more on measurable performance, we believe Commerce Marketing is poised for rapid growth and will represent a major marketing category in the future. 
Since inception, Criteo has solely focused on Commerce Marketing and developed numerous competitive strengths over time.
Competitive Strengths of the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem
We believe that our solution is transforming the way our commerce and brand clients use commerce marketing by making their marketing investments, in particular in Digital Marketing, more efficient, effective and measurable by driving sales across the consumer journey. We believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to capture a growing share of commerce marketing spend:
Criteo Shopper Graph Leverages a Massive, Granular and Open Data Set Focused on Commerce. Over the past few years, we have built the Criteo Shopper Graph, comprising three data collectives -the Identity Graph, the Interest Map and the Measurement Network- through data sharing among our clients. With the Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one of the largest data sets focused on shoppers, with a scope among the largest in the industry. With 79% of our clients providing CRM data to enable us to match 3.7 billion user IDs across multiple digital devices or environments, we believe the matching rates of our Identity Graph are, in some markets, similar to, if not higher than, Google's and Facebook's7. In addition, our Interest Map offers a comprehensive and accurate shopper profile for all customers on whom we have collected information, and is the foundation for the development of compelling new products that will span the consumer journey. Importantly, we believe the guiding principles of Criteo Shopper Graph, in particular its open, transparent and fair approach to sharing and leveraging data within data collectives, differentiate it from the proprietary data management approaches of most of the large Internet companies.

Our Powerful Technology Activates Our Dataset for Commerce. While shopping data is readily available to our commerce and brand clients, and plays a critical role for them, we believe the real challenge in commerce marketing is the ability to effectively activate this dataset to drive sales. The Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem is the result of 12 years of research and development and investment in our technology, with a single focus on driving sales for clients. Through our deep data-driven understanding of consumer intent and behavior, we are able to deliver highly relevant, targeted and personalized advertisements across multiple marketing objectives and digital devices. The scale and breadth of our data is constantly expanding as users interact with our clients and as we deliver targeted advertisements. For example, in 2017, we delivered over 1.3 trillion targeted advertisements. By dynamically matching a user's intent or interest with a personalized advertisement, we are able to deliver more relevant and engaging advertisements to users, which are more likely to lead to sales. Our average click-through rate ("CTR"), or the ratio of clicks generated by our advertisements over the number of advertising impressions we purchased, was 0.84% in 20178, which represents a factor of over six times the average CTR as measured by the DoubleClick display benchmark tool9. We believe our superior CTR demonstrates the performance we consistently deliver. In addition, the Criteo Engine is supported by a flexible and scalable high-performance computing infrastructure, made of two Hadoop clusters hosting 76,000 processing cores with total storage capacity of 240,000 terabytes and 530 terabytes of random-access memory. Every day, our platform can process 250 terabytes of additional compressed data. We own approximately 25,500 servers through a global network of eight data centers. We believe the power and scalability of our core technology assets are increasingly hard to replicate by other market participants. 
Our Large Scale Drives Powerful Network Effects. Our technology, developed and maintained by over 700 engineers, operates at significant scale and is powered by machine-learning algorithms whose accuracy and performance improve with each new piece of information about a user and the billions of advertising impressions we analyze daily. We believe this creates a cycle of increasing network effects. Over the past twelve years, we have built an extensive network of relationships with our clients and publishers, creating a highly liquid marketplace for advertising inventory. As of December 31, 2017, we had over 18,000 clients, including some of the largest commerce companies in the world. As we continue to grow our client base, we continue to grow the number of users who interact with our advertisements, which allows us to benefit from greater scale when we purchase inventory from publisher partners, many of whom have granted us preferred access to portions of their advertising inventory. On the supply side, we have direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners and are also integrated with the leading RTB advertising exchanges. As of December 31, 2017, we had matched an estimated 1.2 billion individual users, with an average of three user IDs matched per user, globally within our Identity Graph, making it one of the biggest user graphs in the market. As commerce clients spend more with us and we attract more publisher inventory and deliver more advertisements, our data assets grow, enabling us to deliver even more precisely targeted and personalized advertisements and generate additional sales for our clients. For brands, we have also created a strong network effect with Sponsored Products by offering brands the opportunity to advertise on a large network of retailers with a single campaign. As a result, we believe more commerce and brand clients will use our offering and potentially increase their spend with us. This, in turn, will enable us to increase advertising revenue for our publishers, further expanding our publisher network and enhancing our ability to drive increasing volumes of sales for clients. We expect this cycle of self-reinforcing network effects to continue to fuel our growth. 
We Have a Complete Commerce Marketing Solution. Our solution addresses the entire consumer journey (customer acquisition, conversion and re-engagement) and works seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), digital environments (web and mobile applications), platforms and operating systems, marketing channels (Display Advertising inventory, including social and native, video inventory, and sponsored products advertisements on retail ecommerce sites), and publisher networks (Google, Facebook and thousands of publishers and mobile application developers in the open web). With the fast increase in smartphone and tablet usage in an increasingly fragmented digital landscape, it has become critical for marketers to engage and convert their customers across multiple digital devices. We believe that, for marketers looking to engage with their prospective customers, or existing customers, irrespective of their position in the consumer journey, their digital device, digital environment, platform, marketing channel or publisher network where the customer may be reached and engaged, our complete commerce marketing solution provides a clear advantage over other solutions available on the market.

We Have a Performance-Driven Model. With all our commerce marketing products, we only get paid when a user engages with one of our advertisements, usually by clicking on it, and our clients generally measure the performance of our solution based on post-click sales. This is a proven model, valued by our clients because it provides a clear link between the cost of marketing campaigns and their effectiveness in generating sales. As the Criteo Engine becomes more sophisticated, we are optimizing our technology to maximize post-click sales at a target cost-of-sales or the target gross margin per product of our clients. As a result of our measurable pay-for-performance model, most of our clients set their budgets with us whereby their total spend with us is effectively constrained mainly by our ability to find enough relevant opportunities that achieve their specific return objectives. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2017 over 75% of our Revenue ex-TAC was derived from clients whose budgets were either uncapped or so large that the budget constraint did not restrict purchases of advertisements by us. In addition, existing clients continue to increase their spend with us, as illustrated by our 115% revenue retention rate10 for the year ended December 31, 2017, demonstrating our ability to drive revenue expansion within our existing client base.
Our Product Portfolio Covers the Entire Consumer Journey. With our existing product portfolio, consisting of Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA, Criteo Audience Match BETA and Criteo Sponsored Products, we help our clients cover the entire consumer journey: acquiring new prospective customers, converting them into buyers and regularly re-engaging them over the customer lifetime. We continue to build and develop compelling new products for our commerce and brand clients to help them drive sales and profits through additional marketing scenarios along the consumer journey. We believe our ability to drive sales and profits for clients according to numerous marketing objectives and scenarios across the consumer journey is a key competitive advantage on the market.
We Have a Scaled Global Presence. We do business in 98 countries and have a direct operating presence through 31 offices in 19 countries. In 2017, 40% of our revenue was derived from clients who conducted commerce marketing campaigns with us in more than one national market. We have achieved this global presence by replicating and scaling our business model across all geographic markets. Large businesses are increasingly seeking global marketing partners with comprehensive commerce marketing solutions that are effective across multiple geographies. We believe we are able to meet this demand by leveraging our scalable technology and global network of relationships and are well positioned to serve our clients in virtually every market in which they seek to drive sales.
We Offer Transparent Measurement and End-To-End Service. Our offering is end-to-end and all-inclusive, encompassing the integration of our clients' digital properties, user reach and tracking, the real-time buying of impressions on a large network of publishers, the real-time creation of customized advertisements for each specific client and its prospective end customer, the serving and delivery of the advertisements and the provision of real-time analytics on the performance of our campaigns. In addition, our clients have 24/7 access to a unified dashboard to manage their commerce marketing spend, product by product. Our platform automates most of the processes associated with executing a commerce marketing campaign, such as creative assembly, real-time buying of inventory, campaign optimization, and billing. Using our platform, our clients are able to manage their campaigns based on their specific cost of sales or return on investment objectives on large volumes, with real-time control over the price they pay. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and multiple providers involved in the management of performance-based multi-product marketing campaigns. Further, we are able to continue to deliver these efficiencies even as marketing campaigns scale and become more complex in size and product mix. We also provide our clients with transparent and detailed reporting of key campaign metrics, and transparent standard reports showing detailed impression-level information (See the "Client Platform" description in the section about the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem). We believe the ease of use and transparency of our offering is a key strength on the market.

We Apply Best-In-Class User Privacy Standards. We are strongly committed to consumer privacy. The user information we collect relates primarily to purchase intent and is therefore not considered as information that can directly identify a user. In 2009, we were one of the first companies to include an "Ad Choices" link in all the advertisements we deliver, which gives users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized advertisements and the data practices associated with the advertisements they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted advertisements we deliver, either for all campaigns or for a specific client or specific period of time. We believe that this transparent consumer-centric approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the advertisements we deliver and monitor. We believe our industry-leading privacy, security and safety standards for consumers and our commerce and brand clients are key competitive advantages on the market.
Our Growth Opportunities 
Our goal is to drive post-click sales at scale for our clients at their targeted return on investment and across the entire consumer journey. Our vision is to build the highest performing and open Commerce Marketing Ecosystem, by connecting shoppers to the things they need and love, and by delivering the highest performance to the commerce companies and brand manufacturers who participate in our ecosystem. We are currently expanding our business and strengthening our Commerce Marketing Ecosystem through several growth opportunities, both within our core business and in new areas focused on driving client sales. The core elements of our growth strategy include:
Further Build and Leverage the Criteo Shopper Graph. Since 2015, we have been developing the Criteo Shopper Graph, which comprises three data collectives -the Identity Graph, the Interest Map and the Measurement Network- through data sharing among our clients. With the Criteo Shopper Graph, we are building one the world's largest data sets focused on shoppers, that offers our clients openness, transparency, security and fairness. The Criteo Shopper Graph, in particular the Identity Graph and the Interest Map, is central to our plans to bring compelling new commerce marketing products to market. We will continue to build and enhance our three data collectives that make up the Criteo Shopper Graph.
Continue to Innovate and Invest in Technology and Data. We will continue to make substantial investments in research and development with a focus on our machine-learning algorithms and further scaling our technology platform. As the rich data sets that drive performance on a real-time basis are central to the value we deliver to our clients, we intend to invest in additional data assets to extract more value from the data we collect.
Upsell New Products Across the Consumer Journey. Our broad product portfolio helps our clients cover the entire consumer journey, by acquiring new prospective customers, converting them into buyers and regularly re-engaging them along the customer lifetime. Since all of our existing products address the needs of our commerce clients, in particular retailers, we intend to continue to upsell Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA and Criteo Audience Match BETA to our existing commerce clients and to offer Criteo Sponsored Products as a key advertising channel to our retail commerce clients to generate high gross margin revenue from brands. 
Broaden Quality Inventory Supply Across our Publisher Network. We currently partner with thousands of media publishers globally for Display Advertising. While we work with both real-time bidding Display Advertising exchanges and direct publishers, including premium publishers, 37% of our Revenue ex-TAC in 2017 was generated from inventory sourced from publishers with whom we have a direct, preferred relationship. We intend to maintain a high level of preferred relationships, with both premium and mid-sized publishers, including through the broader deployment of Criteo Direct Bidder, our latest header bidding technology, with large publishers. In addition, we continue to expand our supply of quality advertising inventory, especially in mobile applications, native and social inventory. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we intend to increase our publisher reach with retailers by providing a broader share of our existing commerce client base with the opportunity to monetize their inventory through brand demand. 
Further Expand our Client Base Globally and Across Sizes, Including Consumer Brand Manufacturers. We have a record of entering new geographic markets, adding new clients successfully and rapidly gaining commercial traction. We intend to continue to grow our client base, both in the large client and the midmarket categories. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, we invested significantly to capture the midmarket opportunity and intend to continue to invest in this large market category. We plan to expand our midmarket presence in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific. We believe significant opportunities remain to also grow our business with large clients in geographic markets where we already operate, such as Western Europe, the United States and Japan. 
15

Additionally we plan to undertake a significant transformation of our go-to-market approach, aiming at maximizing our commercial opportunity while becoming more strategic to large clients and scaling our midmarket operations more efficiently and profitably. This will include focusing on a multi-product sales approach, refining service levels based on client size and potential, and building self-service capabilities for the midmarket. 
Criteo primarily addresses commerce marketing for companies in the retail, travel and classifieds verticals, which we define as commerce clients. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we address the need for measurable performance of brand manufacturers, who can market their products on major retail ecommerce sites. We believe the demand for performance-based marketing from brand manufacturers represents a significant opportunity for us. We will continue to focus on growing our share of brand manufacturers through the expansion of Criteo Sponsored Products to a larger number of retail ecommerce sites.
Develop New Products for Commerce and Brand Clients. In 2007, we started delivering elements of our commerce marketing offering through Dynamic Retargeting on internet display advertisements in desktop browsers. Since then, we have expanded Dynamic Retargeting into mobile in-browser and in-app, native display, including on social media platforms, and, more recently video inventory. In parallel, we have broadened our product portfolio to include: a customer acquisition product for retailers, Criteo Customer Acquisition BETA; a customer re-engagement product for retailers, Criteo Audience Match BETA; and a performance-based product for brand clients to market their products on retail ecommerce sites, Criteo Sponsored Products. To enable our commerce and brand clients to expand their reach inside the consumer journey, we intend to invest in developing products across new marketing scenarios, while always offering a single solution priced on a transparent performance-based model. For example, we are exploring ways to expand into "look-alike" audience targeting for commerce clients, mobile applications installation for commerce clients, or performance-based campaigns for brand manufacturers outside of the retailer environment. 
Grow our Omnichannel Capabilities. A large portion of our commerce client base operates physical stores and still generates a significant percentage of their sales from offline stores. While retailers extract massive amounts of sales data from their physical stores, they often lack the sophisticated technology necessary to activate this dataset for sales generation, both online and offline. As a result, retailers are increasingly interested in omnichannel marketing solutions that allow them to target their customers everywhere and bridge the gap between online and offline. We are expanding our solutions for omnichannel marketing, by feeding our clients' offline CRM data into our Identity Graph, in order to match offline consumers with their online profile. For example, Criteo Audience Match BETA, our customer re-engagement product, allows the uploading of online and offline CRM identities, like hashed emails, to inform and run online campaigns. We are also working on Store-to-web retargeting campaigns, new campaign types to reengage offline buyers to buy more both online and offline. 
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We acquired six companies since our inception. We selectively evaluate technologies and businesses that we believe have potential to enhance, complement or expand our technology platform and product portfolio, or strengthen our research and development team. We target acquisitions that can be efficiently integrated into our technology platform, global operations and company culture, while preserving the quality and performance of our offerings. We believe we are an acquirer of choice among prospective acquisition targets thanks to our entrepreneurial culture, growth, global scale, strong brand and market position.
Strategic Relationship with Yahoo! Japan
In August 2012, we entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, a leading provider of advertising inventory in Japan, which grants us privileged access to their performance-based display inventory. In connection with this strategic relationship, Yahoo! Japan invested in our subsidiary, Criteo K.K. We retain 66% ownership of Criteo K.K. and Yahoo! Japan holds a 34% ownership. Yahoo! Japan has the right to require us to buy back its interest upon the occurrence of certain events (such as bankruptcy or breach of obligations), and we have the right to require them to sell their interest in Criteo K.K. under specified circumstances, such as a termination of the commercial relationship. 
This strategic relationship may be terminated by either party for material breach and other customary events. The term of this strategic relationship automatically renewed to August 2018 and will continue to renew automatically thereafter for one-year terms if neither party provides advance written notice of its intent not to renew within a specified period of time. 
16

Infrastructure
Our ability to execute depends on our highly sophisticated global technology software and hardware infrastructure. As of December 31, 2017, our global infrastructure included approximately 25,500 servers, including two Hadoop clusters comprising 3,350 servers providing a storage capacity exceeding 240,000 terabytes and 530 terabytes of random-access memory. Our global infrastructure is divided into three independent geographic zones in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. In each of these zones, our services are delivered through data centers that support this zone. We generally rely on more than one data center in any given zone. The data centers are strategically placed within large zones to be close to our clients, publishers and users. This provides the benefit of minimizing the impact of network latency within a particular zone, especially for time-constrained services such as RTB. In addition, we replicate data across multiple data centers to maximize availability and performance. We also generally seek to distribute workload across multiple locations to avoid overloads in our systems and increase reliability through redundancy.
Within each data center, computing power is provided by horizontal build-outs of commodity servers arranged in multiple, highly redundant pools. Some of these pools are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering advertisements while others are devoted to the data analytics involved in creating these advertisements. In particular, we use clusters using software specifically designed for processing large data sets, such as Hadoop, to run offline data analyzes. The results are then fed back to refresh and improve our prediction and recommendation algorithms.
We use multiple-layered security controls to protect the Criteo Engine and our data assets, including hardware- and software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management.
Our Clients 
Our client base consists primarily of companies in the retail, travel and classifieds verticals, which we define as commerce clients, and includes some of the largest and most sophisticated commerce companies in the world. These companies range from large, global, diversified commerce companies to mid-sized regional companies. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we also serve brand manufacturers, which we refer to as brand clients. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than 18,000 clients (commerce and brand clients combined), representing clients who had a marketing campaign live with us on any given day over a 12 trailing-month period. In 2017, approximately 84% of our client relationships11 were held directly with the client, whereby there was no advertising agency or any other third-party involved in our client relationship. 
We believe our business is not substantially dependent on any particular client or group of clients. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, our largest client represented 1.9%, 2.0% and 1.9% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2017 our largest 10 clients represented 11.2% of our revenue in the aggregate. 
There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
We define a client to be a unique party from whom we have received an insertion order and delivered an advertisement during the previous 12 months. We count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders with us. On the other hand, we count a client who runs campaigns in multiple geographies as a single client, even though multiple insertion orders may be involved. When the insertion order is with an advertising agency, we generally consider the client on whose behalf the marketing campaign is conducted as the "client" for purposes of this calculation. In the event a client has its marketing spend with us managed by multiple agencies, that client is counted as a single client.
Our client base is composed of two client categories: the large client category and the midmarket category. We define large clients as the top-50 or the top-100 commerce websites per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, based on the number of monthly unique visitors as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. We define a midmarket client as any client outside of the large client category per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, and with a certain minimum threshold number of unique monthly visitors to their digital property, as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. This minimum threshold varies by market, but is generally around 40,000 unique monthly visitors for our more developed markets. The delineation between the large client and midmarket categories is fluid and the Company may decide, from time to time, to move some clients from one category to another.

Research and Development 
We invest substantial resources in research and development to conduct fundamental research on machine-learning models, enhance the algorithms in our Engine, develop new features and products, conduct quality assurance testing, improve our core technology and enhance our technology infrastructure. Our engineering group is primarily located in research and development centers in Paris, France; Grenoble, France; Palo Alto, California and Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect to continue to expand capabilities of our technology in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development and new product efforts. We had over 700 employees primarily engaged research and development and product at December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses, including expenses related to the Product group, totaled $86.8 million, $123.6 million and $173.9 million for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require employees, consultants, clients, publishers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Agreements with our employees and consultants may also be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies to redress any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights to know-how and inventions relating thereto or resulting therefrom. Finally, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
As of December 31, 2017, we held five patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, one patent issued by the French Patent Office, one patent issued by the European Patent Office, one patent issued by the Japan Patent Office and one patent issued by the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and had filed 29 non-provisional U.S. patent applications, five European patent applications and one international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our products and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our clients or our publishers. Litigation and associated expenses may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights.
Privacy, Data Protection and Content Control
Legal and Regulatory
Privacy and data protection laws play a significant role in our business. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of consumer data by advertising networks, advertisers and publishers is frequently evolving in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The United States and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share non-identifying data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies.

In the United States, at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. At the federal level, online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. Various states have also enacted legislation that governs these practices. For example, on September 27, 2013, the governor of California signed into law AB 370, an amendment to the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, or CalOPPA. This amendment requires that we disclose in our privacy policy how we respond to web browser "do not track" signals. Our privacy policy discloses that we do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals but that we do respond to opt-out requests made through our proprietary opt-out button or through industry opt-out platforms (namely Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance).
In addition, the Criteo Commerce Marketing Ecosystem reaches users throughout the world, including in Europe, Australia, Canada, South America and Asia-Pacific. As a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, data protection laws in Europe can be more restrictive regarding the collection and use of data than those in U.S. jurisdictions.
In the European Union, the two main pillars of the data protection legal framework are the E-Privacy Directive (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications), which is currently under review, and the new General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in April 2016.
Directive 2002/581-EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or the E-Privacy Directive, was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2009, or the E-Privacy Directive Amendment, to require countries in the European Union to enact specific legislation requiring companies like ours, along with advertisers and publishers, to present users with an information notice and to obtain their consent prior to placing cookies or other tracking technologies for purposes of targeted advertising. The E-Privacy Directive Amendment was intended to be implemented in all 28 countries of the European Union, but it has been implemented differently across the European Union member states. Some member states, like the United Kingdom, permit companies to imply consent from the user’s proceeding onto the website and continuing his/her navigation after s/he has been clearly informed about how cookies are used without disabling them. 
Other member states currently require, through law and/or guidance, that the user’s consent must be obtained prior to the placement of cookies for targeted advertising purposes. The position regarding prior consent versus consent at the time of cookie dropping is not fully settled within the European Union. 
The position regarding explicit versus implied consent also is still not fully settled within the European Union. On October 2, 2013, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, a group with an advisory status composed of representatives of the European Union data protection authorities and the European Commission, issued new guidance on the obtaining of consent for cookies under the E-Privacy Directive and recommended that consent be expressed by the user's positive action or other active behavior, such as clicking on a link, image or other content, based on clear information that cookies will be set due to this action. While the European Institutions are still in the process of adopting a regulation proposal to review the E-Privacy Directive, there is no assurance that tracking for advertising purposes will not be affected, as the mechanisms for "cookie" consent are being re-discussed. 
In December 2016, E.U. institutions reached an agreement on a draft regulation that was formally adopted in April 2016, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR updates and modernizes the principles of the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The GDPR significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance. The European Union data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the data controller's or data processor's total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. We believe that the regulation should not have a material impact on our business or the way our technologies operate. However, interpretations of the GDPR may vary, especially with respect to the conditions for collection of a valid "non-ambiguous" consent, and thus there can be no assurance that this will be the case. To illustrate this risk of different interpretations by the competent authorities, the Spanish Data Protection Authority (Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos) published guidance on GDPR compliance for Data Controllers in which it is stated that continuing to browse a website could materialize the consent of a user for cookie tracking, while the UK Data Protection Authority (Information Commissioner's Office) is listing stricter requirements in its own guidance and seems to impose a very clear and specific statement of consent. The regulation will be enforced after a two-year transition period beginning in May 2018. 
As we continue to expand into other foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.

Self-Regulation
In addition to complying with extensive government regulations, we voluntarily and actively participate in several trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct relating to targeted advertising. For example, the Internet Advertising Bureau EU & US, the Network Advertising Initiative, the European Digital Advertising Alliance and the Digital Advertising Alliance have developed and implemented guidance for companies to provide notice and choice to users regarding targeted advertising.
In addition to complying with such guidance, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising, and allow them to opt out from the use of such data for the delivery of targeted advertising. In an effort to harmonize the industry’s approach to internet-based advertising, these programs facilitate a user's ability to disable services of integrated providers, but also educate users on the potential benefits of online advertising, including access to free content and display of more relevant advertisements to them. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that we participate in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
In 2009, we became one of the first companies to broadly include an "Ad Choices" link in all the advertisements we deliver, which gives users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized advertisements and the data practices associated with the advertisements they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted advertisements we deliver, either for all campaigns or for a specific client or specific period of time. We believe that this transparent consumer-centric approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to the advertisements we deliver and monitor.
Content Control and Brand Safety 
To protect against unlawful advertiser and publisher content, we include restrictions on content in our terms and conditions. We also take a large variety of brand safety measures to ensure that the brand equity of our clients is preserved at all times. These measures include determining that each publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and those of our clients to ensure that their display advertisements are not shown in inappropriate content categories. For that purpose, we use numerous internal systems and processes to filter out inventory in real time, including the list of suspect IP addresses from the Trustworthy Accountability Group and the lists of invalid traffic from several specialized external vendors. With respect to our inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize a mix of proprietary methodologies as well as third-party software to verify that inventory where the advertisement placement is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our clients. 
Government Regulation
In addition to the laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection described above, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
Competition 
We compete in the market for commerce marketing, primarily through Display Advertising. Our market is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex and still fragmented, although rapidly consolidating. We face significant competition in this market, which we expect to intensify in the future, partially as a result of potential new entrants in our market, including but not limited to large well-established internet publishers and players. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Alliance Data, Corp. ("Alliance Data"), Google, Amazon.com ("Amazon"), Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"), as well as smaller, privately held companies. Potential competition could emerge from large enterprise marketing platforms, like Adobe Systems Inc. ("Adobe"), Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), and Salesforce.com, Inc. ("Salesforce"). In addition, web browsers, and desktop and mobile operating systems developed by large software companies like Google and Apple Inc. ("Apple") can have a significant influence and impact on the way we operate. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 
20


• | access to granular commerce data on a large scale;


• | technology-based ability to activate commerce data for sales generation;


• | technology-based ability to generate high return on marketing spend at scale;


• | breadth and depth of consumer reach;


• | measurability of the marketing spend performance, based on clear and transparent accountability metrics;


• | completeness and effectiveness of solution across digital devices, environments, platforms, marketing channels and publisher networks;


• | relevance and breadth of product portfolio to address numerous commerce marketing objectives;


• | openness, transparency, security and fairness of data sharing and data management practices;


• | client trust;


• | global presence;


• | client service and detailed, transparent client reporting;


• | commitment to data protection and user privacy; and


• | ease of use.

We believe that we are well positioned with respect to all of these factors and expect to continue to grow and capture an increasing share of commerce marketing budgets worldwide.
Seasonality
Our client base consists primarily of businesses in the digital retail, travel and classifieds industries, which we define as commerce clients. In the digital retail industry in particular, many businesses devote the largest portion of their advertising spend to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday spending by consumers. With respect to Criteo Sponsored Products, the concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter of the calendar year is particularly pronounced. Our retail commerce clients typically conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the first and second quarters than they do in other quarters, while our travel clients typically increase their travel campaigns in the first and third quarters and conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the second quarter. As a result, our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature, but the impact of this seasonality has, to date, been partly offset by our significant growth and geographic expansion. If the seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,764 employees. Our employees employed by French entities (957 employees) are represented by a labor union, employee representative bodies (works' council, employee delegates and a health and safety committee) and covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider labor relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
