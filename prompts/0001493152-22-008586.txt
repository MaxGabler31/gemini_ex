Item 1. Business.
Business History
 
Our company was incorporated as LandStar, Inc., a Nevada corporation, on May 4, 1998, for the purpose of purchasing, developing and reselling real property, with its principal focus on the development of raw land.
 
In or around July 2017, we sought to effect a merger transaction (the “Merger”) under which the Company would be merged into Data443 Risk Mitigation, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“Data443”). Data443 was originally formed under the name LandStar, Inc. The name of the North Carolina corporation was changed to Data443 in December 2017. In November 2017, our controlling interest was acquired by our current chief executive officer and sole board member, Jason Remillard, when he acquired all of the Company’s outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Shares (the “Series A Shares”). Mr. Remillard, at that time, was appointed as our sole director and sole officer of Data443.
 
In January 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Myriad Software Productions, LLC, which was owned 100% by Mr. Remillard. Those assets were comprised of the software program known as ClassiDocs®, and all intellectual property and goodwill associated therewith. As a result of the acquisition, the Company was no longer a “shell” under applicable securities rules. In consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to a purchase price of $1,500,000, comprised of: (i) $50,000 paid at closing; (ii) $250,000 in the form of a promissory note; and (iii) $1,200,000 in shares of our common stock, valued as of the closing, which equated to 800 shares of our common stock. The shares have not yet been issued and are not included as part of our issued and outstanding shares. However, these shares have been recorded as “Acquisition of ClassiDocs” included in additional paid in capital within our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.

In June 2018, after careful analysis and in reliance upon professional advisors we retained, it was determined that the Merger had not been completed, and that the Merger was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. As such, the Merger was legally terminated. In June 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of Data443 (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Data443 became our wholly-owned subsidiary, with both the Company and Data443 continuing to exist as corporate entities. As consideration in the Share Exchange, the Company agreed to issue to Mr. Remillard: (a) 67 shares of our common stock and (b) on the eighteen-month anniversary of the closing of the Share Exchange (the “Earn Out Date”), an additional 67 shares of our common stock, provided that Data443 has at least an additional $1,000,000 in revenue by the Earn Out Date (not including revenue directly from acquisitions). None of the shares of our common stock to be issued to Mr. Remillard under the Share Exchange have been issued. As such, none of said shares are included as part of our issued and outstanding shares. However, these shares have been recorded as “Share exchange with related party for Data443 additional share issuable” included in additional paid in capital within our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.
 
On April 21, 2021, the Company again amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock from 1.8 billion to 3.8 billion.
 
On or around February 7, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Management Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Wala, Inc. (“Wala”). Under the License Agreement the Company was granted the exclusive right and license to receive all benefits from the marketing, selling, and licensing of the data archiving platform known as ArcMail and all assets related thereto (the “ArcMail Assets”). In connection with the License Agreement, the Company also executed (i) a Stock Rights Agreement, under which the Company had the right to acquire all shares of stock of Wala; and, (ii) a Business Covenants Agreement, under which Wala and its CEO agreed to not compete with the Company’s use of the ArcMail assets for a designated period of time. The Company has not purchased any outstanding shares under the Stock Purchase Rights Agreement. The License Agreement, Stock Rights Agreement, and Business Covenants Agreement are collectively referred to herein as the “ArcMail Agreements”).
 
On February 12, 2021, and effective January 31, 2021 the Company terminated each of the ArcMail Agreements and has asserted numerous claims under the ArcMail Agreements. Further, Wala lost all rights to the ArcMail Assets through a foreclosure action brought by certain secured creditors of Wala (the “Wala Creditors”). The Company considers its relationship with Wala to be closed and does not intend to pursue any further action in that regard.
 
On February 12, 2021 the Company closed its acquisition of the ArcMail Assets from the Wala Creditors pursuant to the terms and conditions of an Asset Sale Agreement executed by and between the Company and the Wala Creditors. The effective date of the Asset Sale Agreement and the acquisition was deemed to be January 31, 2021. Total purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) was One Million Four Hundred Four Thousand Dollars ($1,404,000), evidenced by three promissory notes in favor of the Wala Creditors in the total amount of the Purchase Price (the “Notes”). Payments under the Notes commence in 30-days and continue monthly thereafter for 60-months. The Notes are secured by a pledge of the ArcMail Assets as collateral under the terms of a Security Agreement in favor of the Wala Creditors. The foregoing descriptions of the Asset Sale Agreement; Notes; and, Security Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the actual language contained in the Asset Sale Agreement, Notes, and Security Agreement, respectively, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report.
 
On June 10, 2021, the Company effected the following actions:
 
(1) Amendment of our articles of incorporation (the “Articles of Incorporation”) to decrease the authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 1,800,000,000 to a number of not less than 10,000,000 and not more than 1,000,000,000 (the “Authorized Common Stock Reduction”), at any time prior to the one year anniversary of the filing of the Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14C with respect to these actions filed on February 23, 2021 (the “Definitive Information Statement”), with the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) having the discretion to determine whether or not the Authorized Common Stock Reduction would be effected, and if effected, the exact number of the Authorized Common Stock Reduction within the above range.
 
(2) That the Board be authorized to implement a reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock by a ratio of not less than 1-for-10 and not more than 1-for-2,000, (the “Reverse Split”), at any time prior to the one year anniversary of the filing of the Definitive Information Statement, with the Board having the discretion to determine whether or not the Reverse Split is to be effected, and if effected, the exact ratio for the Reverse Split within the above range.

On April 23, 2021, the Company entered into and closed a financing transaction pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Auctus Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Auctus”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Auctus purchased from the Company a Senior Secured Promissory Note (the “Note”) in the aggregate principal amount of $832,000 (the “Principal Amount”), and delivered gross proceeds of $750,000 (excluding legal fees of Auctus and a transaction fee charged by Auctus). The Note is secured by a security interest in the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”). Timely payment under the Note is further secured by the issuance of Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the “Second Warrant”) to Auctus for 55,467 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $15.00, exercisable only in the event of a default under the Note. Interest on the Principal Amount of the Note accrues at the rate of 12% per annum, which amount is fully due and owing upon the issuance of the Note. Repayment of all amounts due under the Note shall be tendered on the 12-month anniversary of the Note. The Note may be prepaid in whole at any time without prepayment penalty or premium. If the Company fails to meet its obligations under the terms of the Note, the Note shall become immediately due and payable and subject to penalties provided for in the Note. The Company also granted to Auctus warrants to acquire 55,467 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant (the “First Warrant”). Exercise price for the warrants is $15.00, with a cashless exercise option. Both the First Warrant and the Second Warrant impose an obligation on the Company to reserve for issuance that number of shares of the Company’s common stock which is 5 times the number of shares issuable under both the First Warrant and the Second Warrant.
 
As of September 30, 2021, the Company had sold to Triton 83,334 shares of its common stock pursuant to the CSPA, which shares were registered under the Company’s Registration on Form S-1 initially flied on June 4, 2021 and subsequently amended on December 7, 2021. All sales occurred during the three month period ended March 31, 2021 and resulted in the receipt by the Company of net proceeds in the amount of $847,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2021.
 
A 1-for-2,000 Reverse Stock split was processed by FINRA and became effective at the start of trading on July 1, 2021. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 2,000 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, were converted into one (1) share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share.
 
On January 5, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) which (i) reduced the number of authorized shares of common stock to one hundred twenty-five million (125,000,000); and, (ii) effected a reverse stock split (the “1-for-8 Reverse Stock Split”) of its issued common stock in a ratio of 1-for-8. The preferred stock of the Company was not changed. The 1-for-8 Reverse Stock split was processed by FINRA and became effective at the start of trading on March 8, 2022. As a result of the 1-for-8 Reverse Stock Split, each 8 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, was converted into one (1) share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 1-for8 Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares because they hold a number of pre-1-for-8 Reverse Stock Split shares of the Company’s common stock not evenly divisible by 8 had the number of post-1-for-8 Reverse Stock Split shares of the Company’s common stock to which they are entitled rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of the Company’s common stock. No stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. The share and per share information in this Annual Report reflects such assumed reverse stock split.
 
On January 19, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Centurion Holdings I, LLC (“Centurion”) to acquire the intellectual property rights and certain assets collectively known as Centurion SmartShield Home and SmartShield Enterprise, patented technology that protects and recovers devices in the event of ransomware attacks. The total purchase price of $3,400,000 consists of: (i) a $250,000 cash payment at closing; (ii) the $2,900,00 promissory note issued by Data443 in favor of Centurion; and (iii) $250,000 in the form of a contingent payment.

The mounting threat landscape has accelerated security adoption rates and our extensive portfolio of data security and privacy products provide a holistic methodology to data privacy as a new security standard. Our offering is anchored in privacy management, equipping organizations with a seamless approach to safeguarding their data, protecting against attacks, and mitigating the most critical risks.
 
Data security and privacy legislation is driving significant investment by organizations to offset risks from data breaches and damaging information disclosures of various types. We provide solutions for the marketplace that are designed to protect data via the cloud, hybrid, and on-premises architectures. Our suite of security products focus on protection of: sensitive files and emails; confidential customer, patient, and employee data; financial records; strategic and product plans; intellectual property; and any other data requiring security, allowing our clients to create, share, and protect their data wherever it is stored.
 
We deliver solutions and capabilities via all technical architectures, and in formats designed for each client. Licensing and subscription models are available to conform to customer purchasing requirements. Our solutions are driven by several proprietary technologies and methodologies that we have developed or acquired, giving us our primary competitive advantage.
 
We sell substantially all of our products, solutions, and services through a sales model which combines the leverage of channel sales with the account control of direct sales, thereby providing us with significant opportunities to grow our current customer base and successfully deliver our value proposition for data privacy and security. We also make use of channel partners, distributors, and resellers which sell to end-user customers. This approach allows us to maintain close relationships with our customers and benefit from the global reach of our channel partners. Additionally, we are enhancing our product offerings and go-to-market strategy by establishing technology alliances within the IT infrastructure and security vendor ecosystem. While our products serve customers of all sizes in all industries, the marketing focus and majority of our sales focus is on targeting organizations with 100 users or more which can make larger purchases with us over time and have a greater potential lifetime value.
 
Size of Our Market Opportunity
 
Worldwide spending on information security products and services will reach more than $114 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.4 percent from last year, according to the latest forecast from Gartner, Inc. In 2019, the market was forecast to grow 8.7 percent to $124 billion, with further increases expected for 2020. As cloud-based services increase in popularity, that market increases to an estimated $300 billion by 2021. The International Data Corporation’s Data Age 2025: The Evolution of Data to Life-Critical study estimates that the amount of data created in the world will grow to 163 Zettabytes (or 151 trillion gigabytes) in 2025, representing a nearly tenfold increase from the amount created in 2016. They estimate that nearly 20% of that data will be critical to our daily lives (and nearly 10% will be hypercritical). The study also suggests that by 2025, almost 90% of all data will require a meaningful level of security, but less than half will be secured. Every enterprise and governmental agency will almost certainly require new technologies to protect and manage data.
 
We believe that the functionalities offered by our programs and services position us to benefit from this growing market. Further, as we continue to grow our business, we believe that we may have opportunities to expand into collateral growing markets, such IT operations management, storage management and data integration.

Services
 
Maintenance and Support
 
Our intended customers will typically purchase software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our products. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period and access to our technical support services. We will maintain a customer support organization that provides all levels of support to our customers.

We have a highly-trained professional sales force that is responsible for overall market development, including the management of the relationships with our channel partners and supporting channel partners.
Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy focuses on building our brand and product awareness, increasing customer adoption and demand, communicating advantages and business benefits and generating leads for our channel partners and sales force.

Seasonality
 
Our business is not subject to seasonality.
 
Research and Development
 
While currently limited, our planned research and development efforts is expected to focus on improving and enhancing our existing products and services, as well as developing new products, features and functionality. We plan to regularly release new versions of our products which incorporate new features and enhancements to existing ones.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company requires key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship. The Company also requires relevant employees to assign all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with the Company to the Company. In addition, the Company requires individuals and entities with which it discusses potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. The Company’s agreements with clients include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions. We cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.
 
We currently make use of a number of trademarks in our business, including, without limitation, the following:
 

● | ClassiDocs® 
--+-------------
● | ARALOC® 
● | DataExpress™

 
Unlike copyrights and patents, trademark rights can last indefinitely so long as the owner continues to use the mark to identify its goods or services. The term of a federal trademark is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms. The expiry dates for the federal trademark on the three trademarks we make use of in our business are as follows:
 
ClassiDocs: Expires September 14, 2027
 
ARALOC: September 14, 2027
 
DataExpress: September 14, 2027
 
Competition
 
The industry in which we compete is highly competitive. Many companies offer similar products and services for data security. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out operations and marketing efforts. We hope to maintain our competitive advantage by offering quality at a competitive price, and by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our management team.
 
We will face competition from more established companies that have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger sales, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. Increased competition could result in us failing to attract customers or maintaining them. It could also lead to price cuts, alternative pricing structures or the introduction of products available for free or a nominal price, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed.

As of March 28, 2022, we had 26 employees and 4 independent contractors, of which one was considered to be part of our management team; our CEO, Jason Remillard. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. The Company believes that it will be successful in attracting experienced and capable personnel. The Company’s employees are not represented by any labor union.
 
Government regulation
 
We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the “JOBS Act.” An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As a result, the information that we provide to stockholders may be different than the information you may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity. For example, as long as we are an emerging growth company:

● | we are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | we are not required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
● | we are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden parachutes”; and 
● | we are not required to comply with certain disclosure requirements related to executive compensation, such as the requirement to disclose the correlation between executive compensation and performance and the requirement to present a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to our median employee compensation. 

 
We may take advantage of these reduced disclosure and other requirements until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. For example, if certain events occur before the end of such five-year period, including if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company.
 
As mentioned above, the JOBS Act permits us, as an emerging growth company, to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period which means that when an accounting standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, as an emerging growth company, we can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make it difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used to compare our financial statements with the financial statements of a public company that is not an emerging growth company, or the financial statements of an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period.
