Our growth strategy is based upon the following principles: (1) market-driven organization, (2) innovation leadership, (3) synergistic mergers and acquisitions, and (4) operational excellence. As a market-driven organization, we are focused on growth drivers, including advanced mobility and advanced connectivity. More specifically, the key trends and markets that affect our business include the increased use of advanced driver assistance systems, and adoption of electric and hybrid electric vehicles and new technology adoption in the telecom industry, including next generation wireless infrastructure. In addition to our focus on advanced mobility and advanced connectivity, we sell into a variety of other end markets including renewable energy, aerospace and defense and diverse general industrial applications. 
Our sales and marketing approach is based on addressing these trends, while our strategy focuses on factors for success as a manufacturer of engineered materials and components: quality, service, cost, efficiency, innovation and technology. We have expanded our capabilities through organic investment and acquisitions and strive to ensure high quality solutions for our customers. We continue to review and re-align our manufacturing and engineering footprint in an effort to attain a leading competitive position globally. We have established or expanded our capabilities in various locations in support of our customers’ growth initiatives.
We seek to enhance our operational and financial performance by investing in research and development, manufacturing and materials efficiencies, and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers. We strive to evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to improve our business structure and align our business with the changing needs of our customers and major industry trends affecting our business. 
In executing on our growth strategy, we have completed three strategic acquisitions: (1) in January 2017, we acquired the principal operating assets of Diversified Silicone Products, Inc. (DSP), a custom silicone product development and manufacturing business, serving a wide range of high reliability applications, (2) in November 2016, we acquired DeWAL Industries LLC (DeWAL), a leading manufacturer of polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene films, pressure sensitive tapes and specialty products for the industrial, aerospace, automotive, and electronics markets, and (3) in January 2015, we acquired Arlon LLC and its subsidiaries, other than Arlon India (Pvt) Limited (the acquired entities, collectively, Arlon), a leading manufacturer of high performance materials for the printed circuit board industry and silicone rubber-based materials.

Elastomeric Material Solutions
Our EMS operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells elastomeric material solutions for critical cushioning, sealing, impact protection and vibration management applications including general industrial, portable electronics (e.g., mobile internet devices), consumer goods (e.g., protective sports equipment), automotive, mass transportation, construction and printing applications. We sell our elastomeric materials under various trade names, including DeWAL™, ARLON®, PORON®, XRD®, BISCO®, eSORBA® HeatSORB™, and Diversified Silicone Products. The acquisitions of DeWAL and DSP, and their subsequent integration into our EMS operating segment, has enabled us to increase scale and complement our existing product offerings, thus enhancing our ability to support our customers.
Our EMS operating segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Woodstock, Connecticut; Rogers, Connecticut; Bear, Delaware; Carol Stream, Illinois; Narragansett, Rhode Island; Santa Fe Springs, California; Suzhou, China; and Ansan, Korea. We also own 50% of: (1) Rogers Inoac Corporation (RIC), a joint venture established in Japan to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products predominantly for the Japanese market and (2) Rogers INOAC Suzhou Corporation (RIS), a joint venture established in China to design, develop, manufacture and sell PORON products primarily for RIC customers in various Asian countries. INOAC Corporation owns the remaining 50% of both RIC and RIS. RIC has manufacturing facilities at the INOAC facilities in Nagoya and Mie, Japan, and RIS has manufacturing facilities at Rogers’ facilities in Suzhou, China.
Power Electronics Solutions
Our PES operating segment designs, develops, manufactures and sells ceramic substrate materials for power module applications (e.g., variable frequency drives, vehicle electrification and renewable energy), laminated busbars for power inverter and high power interconnect applications (e.g., mass transit, hybrid-electric and electric vehicles, renewable energy and variable frequency drives) and micro-channel coolers (e.g., laser cutting equipment). We sell our ceramic substrate materials and micro channel coolers under the curamik® trade name, and our busbars under the ROLINX® trade name. 
Our PES operating segment has manufacturing and administrative facilities in Ghent, Belgium; Eschenbach, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; and Suzhou, China.
Other
Our Other operating segment consists of elastomer components for applications in ground transportation, office equipment, consumer and other markets; elastomer floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks; and inverters for portable communications and automotive markets. Trade names for our elastomer components include: NITROPHYL® floats for level sensing in fuel tanks, motors, and storage tanks and ENDUR® elastomer rollers. The Arlon polyimide and thermoset laminate business was also included within our Other operating segment prior to its divestiture in December 2015.
Sales and Competition
We sell our materials and components primarily through direct sales channels positioned near major concentrations of our customers in North America, Europe and Asia. We sold to over 5,000 customers worldwide in 2017, primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and component suppliers. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total net sales for 2017; however, there are concentrations of OEM customers in our ACS (Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturers) and PES (semiconductor and automotive manufacturers) operating segments. Although the loss of all of the sales made to any one of our larger customers would require a period of adjustment during which the results of a particular operating segment would be adversely impacted, we believe that such events could be successfully mitigated over a period of time due to the diversity of our customer base.
We employ a technical sales and marketing approach pursuant to which we work collaboratively to provide design engineering, testing, product development and other technical support services to OEMs that incorporate our engineered materials and components in their products. Component suppliers convert, modify or otherwise incorporate our engineered materials and components into their components for these OEMs in accordance with their specifications. Accordingly, we provide similar technical support services to component suppliers.
We compete primarily with manufacturers of high-end materials, some of which are large, multi-national companies, principally on the basis of innovation, historical customer relationship s, product quality, reliability, performance and price, technical and engineering service and support, breadth of product line, and manufacturing capabilities. We also compete with manufacturers of commodity materials, including smaller regional producers with lower overhead costs and profit requirements located in Asia that attempt to upsell their products based principally upon price, particularly for products that have matured in their life cycle. We believe that we have a competitive advantage because of our reputation for innovation, the quality and reliability of our materials and components and our demonstrated commitment to technical support and customer service.

Research and Development
We have a history of innovation, and innovation leadership is a key component of our overall business strategy. The markets we serve are typically characterized by rapid technological changes and advances. Accordingly, the success of our strategy is in part dependent on our ability to develop market-leading products, which is primarily driven by efforts in research and development. We are focused on identifying technologies and innovations related to both our current product portfolio as well as other long term initiatives targeted at further diversifying and growing our business. As part of this technology commitment, we have Rogers Innovation Centers at Northeastern University in Burlington, Massachusetts, as well as at our facilities in Chandler, Arizona, Eschenbach, Germany and Suzhou, China. Our Innovation Centers focus on the earliest stages of technical and commercial development of new high-tech materials solutions in close alignment with market direction and needs.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We have many domestic and foreign patents, licenses and have additional patent applications pending related to each of our operating segments. These patents and licenses vary in duration and provide some protection from competition.
We also own a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and have acquired and developed certain confidential and proprietary technology, including trade secrets that we believe to be of some importance to our business.
While we believe our patents and other intellectual property provide a competitive advantage to our operating segments, we believe that a significant part of our competitive position and future success will be determined by factors such as the innovative skills, systems and process knowledge, and technological expertise of our personnel; the range and success of new products we develop; and our customer service and support.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
The key raw materials used in our business are as follows: for our ACS operating segment, copper and polymer materials; for our EMS operating segment, polyurethane, polytetraflouroethylene, polyethylene and silicone materials; and for our PES operating segment, copper and ceramic materials.
Some of the raw materials used in our business are available through sole or limited-source suppliers. While we have undertaken strategies to mitigate the risks associated with sole or limited source suppliers, these strategies may not be effective in all cases, and disruptions in our supply of raw materials could negatively impact our production and have a material adverse impact on our business. For more information, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
Except for some minor seasonality for consumer products, which often aligns with year-end holidays and product launch cycles, the operations of our segments have not been seasonal.
Our Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,400 people.
Backlog 
Our backlog of firm orders was $122.8 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $106.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The ACS, PES and Other operating segments experienced year-over-year increases in backlog of $2.2 million, $13.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively while the EMS operating segment experienced a year-over-year decrease of $6.4 million. The increase in backlog for the ACS, PES and Other operating segments is primarily due to overall sales growth in 2017 compared to 2016, as well as increases in long-term buying patterns in the ACS operating segment, and favorable currency fluctuations in our PES operating segment. The decrease in backlog for the EMS operating segment is primarily due to an increase in order fulfillment during 2017 as compared to 2016. Additionally, the 2017 EMS backlog contains $2.1 million related to DSP. The backlog of firm orders is expected to be filled within the next 12 months.
