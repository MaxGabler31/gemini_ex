MARKET INFORMATION 
General Industry Background

Poly operates predominantly in the unified communications industry and focuses on the design, manufacture, and distribution of headsets, voice, video and content sharing solutions as well as a comprehensive line of support and service solutions to ensure customer success. We develop enhanced communication products for offices and contact centers, mobile devices, Open SIP desktop phones, PCs and gaming consoles. Currently, we offer our services under the Poly, Plantronics and Polycom brands, and also offer select products under the brand Poly. Our Consumer gaming headsets are sold under the sub-brand RIG.
We believe the proliferation of communications and collaboration applications across much of people's daily lives makes efficiency, ergonomic comfort, ease of use, interoperability, and safety key factors for our customers' purchasing decisions. We believe important drivers for the adoption of our solutions include:

• | expansion of business applications and ecosystems with integrated web-based video and content collaboration that demand interoperability;

 2


• | virtualization and accelerated adoption of private, public, and hybrid clouds and the resulting customer desire for cloud management tools;


• | ease of use and ease of deployment;


• | global growth of open office environments, small conference and huddle rooms, and the number of mobile and remote workers, with video as a preferred method of communication;


• | adoption of UC&C by small and medium-sized business (SMBs); and


• | continued commitment by organizations and individuals to reduce their expenses and carbon footprint by choosing voice, video and content collaboration over travel.

We believe we are uniquely positioned as the UC&C ecosystem partner of choice through our strategic partnerships, support of open standards, innovative technology, multiple delivery modes, and customer-centric go-to-market capabilities.
We leverage state-of-the-art technologies in our solutions that can be easily used in conjunction with our strategic partners' tools and common communication platforms in both personal and enterprise settings. The increased adoption of technologies such as UC&C, Bluetooth, Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP"), Digital Signal Processing ("DSP"), Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (“DECT™”), and Video-as-a-Service ("VaaS"), each of which is described below, has contributed to increased demand for our solutions:

• | UC&C is the integration of voice, data, chat, and video-based communications systems enhanced with software applications and Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It includes more traditional unified communications consisting of on-premise IP telephony, such as e-mail, instant messaging, presence information, audio and video conferencing, and unified messaging; and more modern team collaboration consisting of cloud-based persistent chat and team workspaces, integrated UC and application integrations; as well as browser-based online meetings consisting of integrated audio, video, and web conferencing. UC&C seeks to provide seamless connectivity and user experience for enterprise workers regardless of their location and environment, improving overall business efficiency and providing more effective collaboration among an increasingly distributed workforce. 


• | Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications protocol intended to replace the cables connecting portable and fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security. The key features of Bluetooth technology are ubiquity, low power, and low cost. The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other. Bluetooth standard has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost anywhere in the world, can connect to other Bluetooth enabled devices in proximity. 


• | VoIP is a technology that allows a person to communicate using a broadband internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) telephone line. VoIP converts the voice signal into a digital signal that travels over the internet or other packet-switched networks and then converts it back at the other end so that the caller can speak to anyone with another VoIP connection or a regular (or analog) phone line. 


• | DSP is a technology that delivers acoustic protection and optimal sound quality through noise reduction, echo cancellation, and other algorithms which improve transmission quality.


• | DECT is a wireless communications technology that optimizes audio quality, lowers interference with other wireless devices, and digitally encrypts communication for heightened call security.


• | Video-as-a-Service (VaaS) is the delivery of multiparty or point-to-point videoconferencing capabilities over an IP network by a managed service provider.

Solutions 
UC&C audio and video solutions continue to represent our primary focus area. We believe our portfolio of solutions, which combines hardware with highly innovative sensor technology and software functionality, provides the ability to reach people using the mode of communication that is most effective, on the device that is most convenient, and with control over when and how people can be reached. In addition, we recognize the importance of supporting increasingly popular remote and mobile work styles that are more prevalent in UC&C environments and the trend toward open plan offices which causes unique noise challenges for office-based work styles. We believe we are still early in the UC&C solutions market adoption cycle and that UC&C systems will become more commonly adopted by enterprises to reduce costs and improve collaboration. We believe our solutions will be an important part of the UC&C environment through the offering of contextual intelligence, a full portfolio of products designed according to quantitatively researched global work styles, and a unique software-as-a-service solutions such as Plantronics Manager Pro and Polycom Device Management Service (PDMS).

Consumer Headsets
We believe the mobile headset category will continue to grow as individuals use the technology for both communications and entertainment.
Revenues from our Consumer Headsets product category are seasonal and typically strongest in our third fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season. Other factors that directly impact performance in the product category include product life cycles (including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology), market acceptance of new product introductions, consumer preferences and the competitive retail environment, changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. 
We also sell gaming and computer audio headsets, sold under our RIG sub-brand, used for interactive on-line and console gaming, that allow users to switch between music and phone calls for multi-functional devices.
In an effort to align our strategy and focus on our core enterprise markets, we announced on May 7, 2019 that we intend to evaluate strategic alternatives for our Consumer Headset products. We have not yet determined the timing, structure, or financial impact of any potential transaction.
Voice, Video, and Content Sharing Solutions
Our Voice products include Open SIP Desktop Phones, which aid both traditional and diverse small-to-medium business and enterprise environments in their UC&C transitions, and conference phones, such as the Polycom Trio line of conference phones. Our Desktop Phone devices extend clear HD voice to desktops, home offices, mobile users, and branch sites. Sales of our Desktop Phones are largely driven from a growing cloud Service Provider channel and strategic partnerships with ecosystem and platform partners seeking to add familiar, but evolved telephony offerings, to meet a wide range of hardware-based voice and video demands. The Polycom Trio line of conference phones is a collaboration hub that has a modular approach to high quality audio, video and content sharing solution for rooms of all sizes. Audio only versions of the Polycom Trio are available in multiple sizes and price points. Trio supports native Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business interfaces as well as connectivity to multiple popular voice and video platforms.
Our Video products consist of The RealPresence Group Series solutions, which comprises a portfolio of high-performance, integrator-ready, and easy-to-use room and immersive telepresence video conferencing systems, as well as the Polycom Studio, our new plug and play video bar and first product in the rapidly growing huddle room video market. Customers have multiple options to incorporate HD data sharing and collaboration into a video conference. 
For customers that prefer an on-premises video infrastructure solution, our RealPresence Clariti solution offers a powerful collaboration software platform through which customers can create audio, video, and content collaboration sessions that can connect with any device from anywhere. The platform also provides best in class interoperability that allows any standards-based endpoint to connect into Microsoft Skype or Teams platforms without having to replace their endpoint investments. We also offer a suite of complementary cloud services that aid management of collaboration endpoints and enable third party cloud services on our devices.

Services Solutions 
We offer a full range of support, professional, managed and cloud services and solutions to customers on a global basis. We provide these services directly, as well as through our worldwide ecosystem of channel partners. We believe our service and support are critical components of customer success and create a platform for stronger customer relationships. We offer a full suite of professional services that allow customers to plan, deploy, and optimize solutions in a UC&C environment. By engaging at all points in this process, we and our partners help customers accelerate deployment, adoption, of UC&C and maximize their Return-On-Investment (ROI). For the ongoing support of end-user customers, we provide maintenance services that include Technical Assistance Center support, software upgrades and updates, parts exchange, on-site assistance, and direct access to engineers for real-time resolution. We also offer an online support portal for customers and a support community where customers can share information and access support 24 hours a day.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS

In Fiscal Years 2017, 2018, and 2019, net revenues outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 45%, 49%, and 53%, respectively, of our total net revenues.  Revenues derived from foreign sales are generally subject to additional risks, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, increased tariffs, the imposition of other trade restrictions or barriers, adverse global economic conditions, and potential currency restrictions.  The impact to consolidated net revenues resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates was not material in Fiscal Year 2019.
We continue to engage in hedging activities to limit our transaction and economic exposures, and to mitigate our exchange rate risks.  We manage our economic exposure by hedging a portion of our anticipated Euro ("EUR") and British Pound Sterling ("GBP") denominated sales and our Mexican Peso ("MXN") denominated expenditures, which together constitute the most significant portion of our currency exposure.  In addition, we manage our balance sheet exposure by hedging EUR, GBP, and Australian Dollar ("AUD") denominated cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable balances. Excess foreign currencies not required for local operations are converted into U.S. Dollars ("USD"). While our existing hedges cover a certain amount of exposure for Fiscal Year 2020, long-term strengthening of the USD relative to the currencies of other countries in which we sell may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, our results may be adversely impacted by future changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to original hedging contracts generally secured 12 months prior. See further discussion on our business risks associated with foreign operations under the risk titled, "We are exposed to differences and frequent fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our revenues, gross profit, and profitability" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.
Further information regarding our foreign operations, as required by Item 101(d) of Regulation S-K, can be found in Note 18, Geographic Information, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.
COMPETITION

The market for our products is competitive and some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, as well as more substantial production, marketing, engineering and other capabilities to develop, manufacture, market, and sell their products.

We compete broadly in the UC&C market, where we have multiple competitors (depending on the product line) on a global basis. These competitors include, Cisco Systems, Inc., Avaya Inc., ClearOne Communications, Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Logitech International S.A., GN Netcom, LifeSize Inc., Snom Technology GmbH, Vidyo, Inc., Yamaha Corporation/Revolabs, Inc., Yealink Network Technology Co., Ltd., ZTE Corporation, Grandstream Networks, Aver Information, Inc., Sennheiser Communications and others. In some cases, we also cooperate and partner with these companies in programs and various industry initiatives.

One of our primary competitors in the Enterprise Headsets and Consumer Headsets areas and, to a lesser extent, in the gaming and PC audio areas is GN Netcom, a subsidiary of GN Store Nord A/S., a Danish telecommunications conglomerate.  In addition, Motorola, Samsung, and LG are significant competitors in the consumer mono Bluetooth headset category. Sennheiser Communications and regional companies are competitors in the computer, office, and contact center categories, while Apple, Skullcandy, Logitech, Bose, and LG are competitors in the stereo Bluetooth headset category.  In addition, Turtle Beach, Skullcandy, Logitech, and Razer are competitors in the gaming category.
 6

Our main competitors in the Voice and Video categories consists of both larger companies, such as Cisco Systems, with substantial financial resources and more sizable sales, marketing, engineering and other capabilities with which to develop, manufacture, market, and sell their solutions, and smaller niche competitors. Our strategy of offering a best-in-class complete portfolio of UC voice and video endpoints faces challenges from competitors, who create end-to-end service and endpoint solutions, as well as low cost competitors in specific categories, or other industry players, who are potentially able to develop unique technology or compete in a specific geography.
For Services, some of our partners resell our maintenance and support services, while others sell their own branded services. To the extent that channel partners sell their own services, these partners compete with us; however, they typically purchase maintenance contracts from us to support these services. As we expand our professional services offering, we may compete more directly with partners in the future.
We believe the principal factors to be successful and competitive in each of the markets we serve are as follows:

• | Understanding emerging trends and new communication technologies, such as UC&C and VaaS, and our ability to react quickly to the opportunities they provide


• | Alliances and integration/compatibility with major UC&C vendors


• | Ability to design, manufacture, and sell products that deliver on performance, style, ease-of-use, comfort, features, sound quality, interoperability, simplicity, price, and reliability


• | Ability to create and monetize software solutions that provide management and analytics and allow business to improve IT and employee performance through insights derived from our analytics.


• | Brand name recognition and reputation


• | Superior global customer service, support, and warranty terms


• | Global reach, including effective and efficient distribution channels

We believe our products and strategy enable us to compete effectively based on these factors.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The success of our new products is dependent on several factors, including identifying and designing products that meet anticipated market demand before it has developed and as it matures, timely development and introduction of these products, cost-effective manufacturing, quality and durability, acceptance of new technologies, and general market acceptance of the products we develop.  See further discussion regarding our business risks associated with our manufacturers under the risk titled, "We face risks associated with developing and marketing our products, including new product development and new product line" within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 
Historically, we have conducted most of our research, development, and engineering with an in-house staff and a limited use of contractors.  Key locations for our research, development, and engineering staff are in the U.S., Mexico, China, and India.
During Fiscal Year 2019, we developed and introduced innovative products that enabled us to better address changing customer demands and emerging trends.  Our goal is to bring the right products to customers at the right time utilizing best-in-class development processes.

The products we develop require significant technological knowledge and the ability to rapidly develop the products in intensely competitive and transforming markets. We believe our extensive technological knowledge and portfolio of intellectual property gives us a competitive advantage. We furthermore continually strive to improve the efficiency of our development processes through, among other things, strategic architecting, common platforms, and increased use of software and test tools.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION 

We maintain a worldwide sales force to provide ongoing global customer support and service.  To support our partners in the Enterprise market and their customers' needs, we have a well-established, two-tiered distribution network in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific regions and, in select markets, direct resellers. 
Our global channel network includes enterprise distributors, direct and indirect resellers, retailers, network and systems integrators, service providers, traditional and online consumer electronics retailers, consumer product retailers, office supply distributors, wireless carriers, catalog and mail order companies, and mass merchants.  
 7

Our distributors, direct and indirect resellers, system integrators, managed service providers, e-commerce partners, telephony and computer equipment providers resell our commercial headsets and endpoint products. Wireless carriers, retailers, and e-commerce partners also sell our consumer headsets as Plantronics branded products. As we expand into new markets and product categories, we expect to build relationships in new distribution and marketing models.
In addition, we have built a strong foundation of alliance partners, which allow existing and future distribution and reseller partners to sell into Microsoft, Zoom, Google and other service provider environments. Our commercial distribution channel maintains an inventory of our products.  Our distribution of specialty products includes retail, government programs, customer service, hospitality and healthcare professionals. Plantronics branded consumer headsets are sold through retailers to corporate customers, small businesses, and individuals who use them for a variety of personal and professional purposes.  Revenues from this channel are seasonal, with our third fiscal quarter typically being the strongest quarter due to holiday seasonality.
Our commercial distributors and retailers represent our first and second largest sales channels in terms of net revenues, respectively. Two customers, ScanSource and Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 16.0% and 11.4%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues in Fiscal Year 2019. One customer, Ingram Micro Group, accounted for 10.9% of consolidated net revenues in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2017. 
Some of our products may also be purchased directly from our website at www.poly.com.
We continue to evaluate our logistics processes and implement new strategies to further reduce our transportation costs and improve lead-times to customers. Currently, we have distribution centers in the following locations:

• | Tijuana, Mexico, which provides logistics services for products destined for customers in the U.S., Canada, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America regions


• | Laem Chabang, Thailand, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Asia Pacific regions


• | Moerdijk, Netherlands, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Europe and Africa regions


• | Prague, Czech Republic, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in our Europe and Africa regions


• | Beijing and Suzhou, China, which provide logistics services for products shipped to customers in Mainland China


• | Melbourne, Australia, which provides logistics services for products shipped to the retail channel in Australia and New Zealand


• | San Diego, United States, which provides logistics services for products shipped to customers in the Americas Region

With respect to the above locations, we use third party warehouses in the Czech Republic, Thailand, Netherlands, Beijing, and
Australia. We operate warehouse facilities in Mexico, San Diego and Suzhou.
BACKLOG

We have a “book and ship” business model whereby we fulfill most orders within 48 hours of receipt. As a result, our net revenues in any fiscal year depend primarily on orders booked and shipped in that year. In addition, our backlog is occasionally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers on short notice with little or no penalty.  Therefore, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between backlog at the end of a fiscal year and the following fiscal year's net revenues. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in net revenues. Consequently, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business.

MANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF MATERIALS

Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of assembly, testing, and packaging, which are performed in our facility in Tijuana, Mexico.  We outsource the manufacturing of most of our Bluetooth products to third party manufacturers in China. We also outsource the manufacturing of a number of our other products to third parties, typically in China and other countries in Asia.  For a further discussion of the business risks associated with our manufacturers see the risk titled, “We have significant manufacturing, assembly and packaging operations in Mexico and rely on third party manufacturers located outside of U.S. which creates manufacturing and management risks that may limit our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver products to customers and thereby adversely impact our revenues or profitability” within Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We purchase the components for our Headset products primarily from suppliers in Asia, Mexico, and the U.S., including proprietary custom integrated circuits, electrical and mechanical components, and sub-assemblies.  A majority of the components and sub-assemblies used in our manufacturing operations are obtained, or are reasonably available, from dual-source suppliers, although we do have a number of sole-source suppliers.
We subcontract the manufacturing of most of our voice and video products to Celestica Inc. (“Celestica”), Askey Computer Corporation (“Askey”), Foxconn Technology Group (“Foxconn”), Pegatron Corporation (“Pegatron”), and VTech Holdings Ltd (“VTech”). These companies are all third-party electronic manufacturing service providers. We use Celestica’s facilities in Thailand and Laos, and Askey’s, Foxconn’s, Pegatron’s, and VTech’s facilities in China. At the conclusion of the manufacturing process, these products are distributed to channel partners and end users through warehouses located in Thailand, the Netherlands, and the United States, and in some cases, direct to channel partners. The key components of our UC Platform products are manufactured by third parties in China, Taiwan, and Israel. Final system assembly, testing and configuration is performed by Celestica China and Celestica Thailand. These UC Platform products are distributed directly to end users from these manufacturing locations.
We procure materials to meet forecasted customer requirements.  Special products and certain large orders are quoted for delivery after receipt of orders at specific lead time.  We maintain a minimum level of finished goods based on estimated market demand, in addition to inventories of raw materials, work in process, sub-assemblies, and components.  In addition, a substantial portion of the raw materials, components, and sub-assemblies used in our products are provided by our suppliers on a consignment basis.  Refer to “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations”, within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding consigned inventories. We write down inventory items determined to be either excess or obsolete to their net realizable value.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process.  We believe that our current manufacturing and other operations comply, in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are required to comply, and we believe we are currently in compliance with the European Union (“EU”) and other Directives on the Restrictions of the use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) and on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) requirements.  Additionally, we believe we are compliant with the RoHS initiatives in China and Korea; however, it is possible that future environmental legislation may be enacted, or current environmental legislation may be interpreted to create an environmental liability with respect to our facilities, operations, or products. See further discussion of our business risks associated with environmental legislation under the risk titled, "We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs" within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We obtain patent protection for our technologies when we believe it is commercially appropriate.  As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,450 worldwide utility and design patents in force, expiring between calendar years 2019 and 2044.
We intend to continue seeking patents on our inventions when commercially appropriate. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and preserve other intellectual property rights covering the design and operation of our products.  See further discussion of our business risks associated with our intellectual property under the risk titled, "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management's time from our business" within Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.

 9

We own trademark registrations in the U.S. and in a number of other countries, as well as the names of many of our products and product features.  We currently have pending U.S. and foreign trademark applications in connection with our Poly brand name and certain new products and product features, and we may seek copyright protection when and where we believe appropriate.  We also own a number of domain name registrations and intend to seek more as appropriate.  We furthermore attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through comprehensive security measures, including agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and suppliers. See further discussion of our business risks associated with intellectual property under the risk titled "Our intellectual property rights could be infringed on by others, and we may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims or lawsuits. Even if we prevail, claims and lawsuits are costly and time consuming to pursue or defend and may divert management’s time from our business."
