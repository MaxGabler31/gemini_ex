Item 1. Business.
Overview
Perimeter Solutions, SA, (“PSSA”), a public company limited by shares (société anonyme) registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register (Registre de Commerce et des Sociétés, Luxembourg) under number B256.548 was incorporated on June 21, 2021 under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the purpose of effecting a business combination. PSSA is headquartered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with global operations in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
On November 9, 2021 (the "Closing Date"), PSSA consummated the transactions contemplated by the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with EverArc Holdings Limited, a company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability in the British Virgin Islands and the former parent company of PSSA ("EverArc"), SK Invictus Holdings, S.à r.l., a limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("SK Holdings"), SK Invictus Intermediate S.à r.l., a limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ("SK Intermediate"), doing business under the name Perimeter Solutions ("Perimeter" or "Perimeter Solutions") and EverArc (BVI) Merger Sub Limited, a company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability in the British Virgin Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSSA ("Merger Sub") pursuant to a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) dated June 15, 2021. The terms “we”, “us”, “our”, and the “Company” refer to PSSA and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SK Intermediate, Perimeter or Perimeter Solutions, after the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”).
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement,
•On November 8, 2021:
•Merger Sub merged with and into EverArc, with EverArc surviving such merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of PSSA (the “Merger”);
•pursuant to the Merger, 155,832,600 ordinary shares of EverArc (the “EverArc Ordinary Shares”) outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were exchanged for ordinary shares of PSSA (the “PSSA Ordinary Shares”); and
•34,020,000 outstanding warrants of EverArc (“EverArc Warrants”), in each case, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-fourth of an EverArc Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $12.00 per whole EverArc Ordinary Share, were converted into the right to purchase PSSA Ordinary Shares on substantially the same terms as the EverArc Warrants (the “PSSA Warrants”); and
•On November 9, 2021:
•SK Holdings (i) along with officers and certain key employees of SK Intermediate contributed a portion of their ordinary shares in SK Intermediate to PSSA in exchange for preferred shares of PSSA and (ii) sold its remaining ordinary shares in SK Intermediate to PSSA for cash.
•PSSA's ordinary shares, nominal value, $1.00 per share, listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "PRM."
On November 8, 2021, pursuant to separate subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) entered into among EverArc, SK Holdings, PSSA and a number of institutional investors, investors affiliated with SK Holdings and individual accredited investors purchased an aggregate of 115,000,000 EverArc Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share (collectively, the “EverArc Subscribers”) that were converted into PSSA Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Merger. In addition, on November 9, 2021, (1) members of management of SK Intermediate (collectively, the “Management Subscribers” and together with the EverArc Subscribers, the “PIPE Subscribers”) were granted an aggregate of 1,104,810 PSSA Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share as consideration and (2) two of our directors (the “Director Subscribers”) purchased an aggregate of 200,000 PSSA Ordinary Shares (the “Director Shares”) at $10.00 per share.
The cash consideration for the Business Combination was funded through cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of the EverArc Ordinary Shares to the EverArc Subscribers, proceeds from the issuance of $675.0 million principal amount of 5.00% senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”) and $40.0 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
In connection with the Business Combination, the Merger was accounted for as a common control transaction, where substantially all of the net assets of PSSA were those previously held by EverArc. Upon the acquisition of SK Intermediate, PSSA was determined to be the legal and accounting acquirer (the “Successor”) and SK Intermediate was deemed to be the accounting predecessor (the “Predecessor”). The business combination with SK Intermediate was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and the Successor financial statements reflect a new basis of accounting based on the fair value of the net assets acquired. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting, our consolidated financial statements and certain presentations are separated into two distinct periods to indicate the different ownership and accounting basis between the periods presented.
We are a global solutions provider for the fire safety and oil additives industries. Our Fire Safety business is a formulator and manufacturer of fire management products that help our customers combat various types of fires, including wildland, structural, flammable liquids and other types of fires. Our Fire Safety business also offers specialized equipment and services, typically in conjunction with our fire management products to support firefighting operations. Our service network can meet the emergency resupply needs of over 150 air tanker bases in North America, as well as many other customer locations globally. Our oil additives business produces and sells high quality Phosphorus Pentasulfide ("P2S5") primarily used in the preparation of lubricant additives, including a family of compounds called Zinc Dialkyldithiophosphates (“ZDDP”) that provide critical anti-wear protection to engine components. We conduct our operations globally, with approximately 73% of our annual revenues derived in the United States, approximately 13% in Europe, approximately 7% in Canada and approximately 2% in Mexico, with and the remaining approximately 5% spread across various other countries. 
Segments
Our business is organized and managed in two reporting segments: Fire Safety and Oil Additives.
Fire Safety Segment
The Fire Safety segment provides fire retardants and firefighting foams, as well as specialized equipment and services typically offered in conjunction with our retardant and foam products.
Fire Retardants
Our fire retardants help slow, stop and prevent wildfires by chemically altering fuels (e.g., vegetation) and rendering them non-flammable. Fire retardant is typically applied ahead of an active wildland fire to stop or slow its spread, in order to allow ground-based firefighters to safely extinguish the fire. Retardants can be applied aerially via fixed or rotor wing aircraft, or by ground using standard fire engines or our dedicated ground-applied retardant units. All of our products have a high level of retardant effectiveness, and differences in visibility, viscosity, adherence to vegetation, and persistence through weathering.
Our fire retardant customers are typically government agencies with responsibility for protecting both government and private land, although we also serve commercial customers. We supply federal, state, provincial, local/municipal, and commercial customers around the world, including in the United States, Canada, France, Spain, Italy, Chile, Australia and Israel. We are a supplier of USDA Forest Service qualified fire retardant – a standard that many countries have adopted for ensuring fire retardant is effective, safe and environmentally friendly.
While fire retardant is primarily used to stop or slow the spread of active wildland fires, our fire retardant is also increasingly utilized in a preventative capacity. We are expanding our offerings to several high hazard industries, with an initial focus on utility companies. Wildfires ignited by utilities have turned into some of the most devastating wildfires in U.S. history, many of which have occurred in recent years. Western U.S. states in particular are becoming increasingly diligent in wildfire prevention efforts and increasing their investments to prevent wildfire risk. 
We are focused on being an innovation leader in fire retardant, driving continuous improvements in product performance to offer increasing value for our customers. We have made significant enhancements in safety, environmental stewardship and effectiveness, as well as advancements in visibility and aerial drop performance. Working in partnership with the USDA Forest Service wildland fire chemicals group to characterize and develop new products, we consistently release new standard-setting products, recently including the Phos-Chek® “Fx” family of ultra-high visibility fugitive-colored products, Phos-Chek LCE20-Fx next generation liquid concentrate, which combines high performance with improved environmental performance, and Phos-Chek Fortify® durable retardant, which can offer season-long protection.

Firefighting Foams
We offer a comprehensive and effective line of firefighting foam, including Class A, Class B, Class A/B, and training foams.
Class A foam is primarily used to combat structural fires. Class A foam is specially formulated to make water more effective for structural fire suppression. The surfactants in Class A foam significantly reduce water’s surface tension, and, when mixed with air, create a foam blanket that surrounds fuels. The foam blanket creates a barrier between the fuel and the fire, knocking down the fire faster than water alone, and allowing fire fighters to see the areas of application. Utilizing Class A foam reduces the amount of water needed to extinguish the fire, reduces water damage, and increases firefighter safety through quicker knockdown and reduced mop-up/overhaul requirements. Perimeter’s Class A foam products are used by wildland firefighters to suppress wildland fires and are typically applied from various fixed wing air tankers, helicopters equipped with fixed tanks or buckets, standard fire engines or rapid attack brush trucks, or 5-gallon backpacks. In addition to wildfire suppression, Class A foam products are used by municipal and rural fire departments as a water enhancer to combat structural and other fires.
Class B foam is primarily used to combat flammable and combustible liquids. Fires caused by flammable and combustible liquids require foams designed for rapid extinguishment and a secure foam blanket to prevent reignition. The foam blanket must have good burn back resistance and strong integrity to minimize the spread of the fire from areas where the blanket has been compromised, for example by falling debris or the dragging of a fire hose or other equipment through the foam blanket. Our Class B foam products are primarily used by industrial customers with significant amounts of flammable and combustible liquids on-site, including petrochemical facilities, airports and other aviation and aerospace facilities, various military and defense facilities, and other industrial and commercial facilities.
Class A/B foam is a foam listed to fight both Class A (structural) fires and Class B (flammable liquid) fires. Our Class A/B foam products are primarily used by municipal fire departments. Training foam has similar characteristics to Class A and B foams but does not include active ingredients and has a shorter drain time so successive tests can be run without waiting for the foam to disappear. Training foam is used for training and exhibition purposes as well as in the evaluation of foam equipment.
We believe that we are an innovation leader in foams. Our Class B foams either use only C6 fluorosurfactant or are fluorine free. We offer several ground-breaking fluorine free firefighting foam formulations to aid the industry transition to reduce or eliminate the use of firefighting foams that contain Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) in favor of fluorine-free foams. Our products are “ahead of the curve” on many fronts – including fire control performance, reduced viscosity, drainage time and higher stability.
Custom Equipment and Services
We offer a broad range of equipment and services to support live firefighting operations within our retardant and foam business lines. Our equipment and services are typically purchased and utilized in conjunction with our retardant or foam products and are often priced in a single bundle along with these products.
Custom equipment includes specialized air base retardant storage, mixing, and delivery equipment; mobile retardant bases; retardant ground application units; and mobile foam equipment. We also have the capability to design and manufacture highly custom equipment that operates at very high throughput and reliability levels, including equipment used to support emergency air tanker base and ground crew operations, as well as custom fire suppressant systems for stationary or portable operations typically used at industrial locations or for supporting municipality firefighting capabilities.
Custom services include design, construction, and installation of specialized air base retardant equipment, management and staffing of air base retardant operations, and management of air base supply and replenishment services. We have a broad service capability footprint, with full-service operations in over 50 United States and Canadian air bases, and equipment at over 100 bases globally.
Oil Additives Segment
The Oil Additives segment produces high quality P2S5 primarily used in the preparation of lubricant additives, including a family of compounds called ZDDP, which is considered a critical component essential in the formulation of 
9


engine oils – its main function is to provide anti-wear protection to engine components. In addition, ZDDP inhibits oxidation of engine oil by scavenging free radicals that initiate oil breakdown and sludge formation, resulting in better and longer engine function. P2S5 is also used in pesticide and mining chemicals applications. We offer several grades of P2S5 with varying degrees of phosphorus content, particle size, distribution, and reactivity to global customers. The P2S5 production process requires a high degree of technical expertise given the reactivity and need for safe transportation and handling. We are committed to being a technology and safety leader, with strong product stewardship and a strong safety track-record. We also conduct regular customer visits and provide extensive technical training to ensure customers are committed to operating safely.
We are focused on being an innovation leader in the oil additives market. Most recently, we engineered and patented superior storage and handling equipment to safely and efficiently handle and transport P2S5 with lower cost and maintenance requirements.
Key Market Drivers
There are several key market drivers for our business in the Fire Safety and Oil Additives segments.
Higher Acres Burned and Longer Fire Seasons
The USDA Forest Service data of the last 38 years shows that the acreage burned in the United States has increased over time. While there is variability in the acreage burned in any given year, the five-year trailing average of acres burned in the United States has increased from a five-year trailing average of 3.2 million acres burned in 1996, to a five-year trailing average of 8.1 million acres burned in 2021. The year 2020 was the most intense fire year recorded in U.S. history with over 10 million acres burned. The U.S. fire season is also lengthening on a consistent basis – according to a 2016 report published by Climate Central, the U.S. fire season is on average 105 days longer than it was in 1970. Climate Central also reported that the average number of large fires (larger than 1,000 acres) burning each year had tripled between the period of 1970s to 2010s, and the acres burned by such fires showed a six-fold increase in the 2010s compared to the 1970s. If acreage burned continues to increase and the fire season continues to lengthen, we expect the demand and usage of fire retardant to increase.
Increasing Wildland Urban Interfaces
Urban development is pushing farther out of cities and into the wilderness for both primary and secondary residences. For example, according to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (“PNAS”), the Wildland-Urban Interface (“WUI”), an area where houses and wildland vegetation meet and intermingle, grew rapidly from 1990 to 2010 in terms of both number of new houses and land area, such that it was the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States, with 97% of that growth the result of new housing. As of 2018, the WUI now includes one-third of all homes in the United States although it occupies less than one-tenth of the land area in the U.S. According to PNAS, when homes are built in the WUI, there will be more wildfires due to human ignitions, and wildfires that occur will pose a greater risk to lives and homes, they will be hard to fight, and letting natural fires burn becomes impossible. As the WUI expands and the number of homes at risk from wildland fires increases, we expect the use of retardant to protect property and life from threatening wildfires to increase.
Increasing Firefighting Aircraft Capacity and Usage
The size and capacity of the firefighting aircraft fleet is a key driver of the amount of fire retardant consumed annually, as demand for retardant typically outpaces available aircraft capacity, as evidenced by data regarding unable to fill aerial firefighting requests published by the National Interagency Fire Center. Since 2010, U.S. aircraft capacity increased significantly and is expected to further increase. Increasing air tanker capacity and modernization is a global trend, with more, larger, and more sophisticated tankers are being used in various parts of the world.
Value-Based and Dynamic Pricing Model Protects Attractive Margins
We believe that our comprehensive and closely intertwined product, equipment, and service offering (described above) provides tremendous value to our customers and serves as an important differentiator and margin enhancement tool. Furthermore, we are able to structure tiered pricing and annual pricing escalators with key customers, allowing the business to cover a portion of certain fixed costs in lower-volume years and protect margins over time.

Comprehensive Product Offering
We are a full-service turnkey supplier to many of our key customers. In the Fire Safety segment, in addition to providing fire retardant, we also provide specialized air base equipment including storage, mixing and loading equipment, as well as the air base management and training services necessary for land and aerial wildland firefighting. Our supply chain network also provides a critical service to our customers – we are able to deliver retardant within hours to over 150 air tanker bases in North America, often in emergency situations as our customers are fighting active and threatening wildfires.
In the Oil Additives segment, our competitive advantage is based primarily on our long-standing record of reliability and customer support, our global supply capability for critical, high quality raw materials, and our technical expertise to handle and transport hazardous products and manage complex logistics. We have the largest fleet of specialized tote bins in the world that utilize patented technology to ensure safe handling and transport of P2S5.
Move toward Fluorine Free Firefighting Foams
There is an accelerating transition in the fire suppression market towards products that do not contain fluorine. We expect Fluorine-Free Foams (“FFF”) to account for a growing percentage of the firefighting foam market over the next several years. We are positioned to be one of the key players in the FFF market. For example, we recently introduced SOLBERG® AVIGARD™ 3B and 6B for the aviation market, and SOLBERG® VERSAGARD™ AS-100 for oil and gas, and general firefighting applications. The latter is a 3x3 fluorine-free foam concentrate and is designed for extinguishing and securing both Class B and deep-seated Class A fires. In addition, SOLBERG® RE-HEALING™ RF3 is the only F3 that has an Underwriters Laboratories 162 sprinkler listing through non-aspirated standard sprinklers at the same low application rates as fluorinated Aqueous Film Forming Foams (“AFFF”). We expect to continue to invest to advance fluorine-free foam technology, increase Underwriters Laboratories and similar listings for our fluorine-free foams and equipment and introduce new solutions as the industry gets closer to fully transitioning away from AFFF and alcohol resistant AFFF solutions.
We are also in a unique position to assist customers in their transitions to FFF. We provide a variety of specialized equipment to customers, including fire suppression system components used in conjunction with our fluorine free offerings. We are also experienced in transition activities, including advising on system modifications associated with transition to fluorine free solutions, as well as performance testing to verify compliance with national and industry standards for new fluorine-free systems. For example, in the past, we have assisted Brisbane Airport (Australia), Schiphol Airport (Netherlands) and Transport Canada in their respective transitions to fluorine-free foams and systems.
Growth in Miles Driven, Opportunities in Secondary Markets
P2S5 is primarily used in the production of lubricant additives, including a family of compounds called ZDDP. The consumption of ZDDP and other lubricant additives is driven by the global social and economic trends of increased vehicle production and miles driven. Over the past 30 years, the number of global miles driven has increased resulting in more engine wear and tear and increased demand for motor oil. Secondary markets for P2S5 include agricultural applications in the production of intermediates for pesticides and insecticides, flotation chemistry in the mining industry, and for hydraulic and cutting fluids. A significant development opportunity exists for P2S5 in the emerging technology of lithium sulfide solid state electrolytes used in batteries for the electric vehicle market.
Nighttime Retardant Operations Opportunity
Nighttime retardant operations represent a significant expansion in the wildfire business and has been studied for several years, but has been limited to water. In 2021, a cooperative initiative among California counties, a helicopter company and the Company was created to provide limited retardant support for night operations. If the nighttime operations program is continued and expanded, this could add materially to our revenues.
Manufacturing Capabilities

Our patent portfolio covers 20 countries and the protection is focused on key retardant technology and advancements, including corrosion inhibitors, fugitive color systems and liquid fire retardant compositions.
Sales and Marketing
Fire Retardant
Fire retardant customers are typically government agencies, with responsibility for protecting both government and private land, although we also serve commercial customers. We supply federal, state, provincial, local/municipal, and commercial customers around the world. We work diligently to build relationships with our customers and stakeholders, and we develop and enhance products and solutions in a highly collaborative manner with our key customers and stakeholders. We provide our retardants in various colors, forms (i.e., liquid or powder concentrates) and for various delivery methods (i.e., fixed wing aircraft, rotor wing aircraft, ground applied, etc.). We expect the demand for our retardant products, equipment, and services to grow, and we expect to continue to foster highly responsive and collaborative relationships with existing and potential customers and stakeholders.
Firefighting Foams
Our Class A foam customers primarily consist of local fire departments, which utilize our products for wildland and structural firefighting. Our Class B foam customers primarily consist of industrial, aviation, and military customers which store and utilize flammable liquids on-site. Our customers in the market for Class A/B foam primarily consist of municipal fire departments. We utilize a traditional sales force in marketing these products and seek to building lasting relationships with our customers.
Oil Additives
Our Oil Additives segment consists of a few key customers including Lubrizol, Afton, Infineum and Chevron. Given the consolidated nature of this business, our focus is on maintaining our existing customers and expanding their utilization of our products and services.
Customers
The markets in which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns. For fiscal year 2021, our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, the USDA Forest Service and the state of California were $103.0 million and $50.5 million, respectively, representing 40% and 19% of our Fire Safety segment revenues, respectively. This customer concentration makes us subject to the risk of nonpayment, nonperformance, 
re-negotiation of terms or non-renewal by these major customers under our commercial agreements. As a supplier and service provider to the U.S. government, we are subject to certain heightened risks, such as those associated with the government’s rights to audit and conduct investigations and with its rights to terminate contracts for convenience or default. The loss of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
Competition
Fire Retardant
Sales of fire retardant, and related equipment and services, accounted for 84% of our Fire Safety segment revenues in 2021. The fire retardant business is characterized by its highly specialized nature, its high cost-of-failure, and the integrated nature of the offering across products, specialized equipment, and services. As a result, development and testing of products, and the approval and licensing of such products, is typically a complex and lengthy process. We plan to maintain our market leadership position through continued investments in innovation and research and development focused on improving, enhancing and customizing our fire retardant products and services on behalf of our customers.
Firefighting Foams
Sales of firefighting foams, and related equipment and services, accounted for 16% of our Fire Safety segment revenues in 2021. The market for our firefighting foam products is highly fragmented, and subject to intense competition from various manufacturers launching their own competing products.

The information on or obtainable through our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report.
We are an emerging growth company ("EGC") as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”) and are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGC. We will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of an IPO; (b) in which PSSA has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; or (c) in which PSSA is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of PSSA’s Ordinary Shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of PSSA’s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which PSSA has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
As an EGC, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
