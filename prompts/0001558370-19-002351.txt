 Overview
 We are a clinical‑stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel, proprietary, synthetic small molecules for the treatment of brain and nervous system disorders. We focus our efforts on targeting and modulating N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate receptors, or NMDArs, which are vital to normal and effective function of the brain and nervous system. We believe leveraging the therapeutic advantages of the differentiated modulatory mechanism of our compounds will drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of disorders of the brain and nervous system.
 We are advancing a pipeline of distinct product candidates derived from our NMDAr modulator discovery platform, or the discovery platform. NYX-2925 is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of chronic pain. We recently completed a 300-subject study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NYX-2925 in patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or painful DPN. We announced in January 2019 that, in the painful DPN study, statistically significant separation from placebo was not observed on the primary endpoint, change in average daily pain from baseline to week four in the total study population. However, the detailed results from the study provide critical findings that inform and support the development path forward for NYX-2925 in chronic pain. We plan to present further detail from this study at the American Pain Society Scientific Meeting in April 2019. We also expect to complete an ongoing exploratory neuroimaging study in patients with fibromyalgia and report data from it in the first half of 2019. NYX-783 is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. We recently initiated a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of NYX-783 in approximately 144 patients with PTSD – we expect to report data from this study in the first half of 2020. We are currently evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NYX-458 in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. We intend to develop NYX-458 for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease.
 Our discovery platform is based on extensive original research into a novel way of modulating NMDArs. NMDArs are a subclass of receptors for glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Our molecules bind in a previously uncharacterized binding domain, or “pocket”, on NMDArs that is distinct from that of other NMDAr‑targeted therapies. The mechanism by which our molecules modulate NMDArs triggers a cascade of activity that ultimately strengthens the synaptic connections between neural cells, resulting in stronger connections over time between these cells. The communication between neural cells is not only essential to routine function of the nervous system, but also allows the cells of the nervous system to learn, or adapt in response to external stimuli, through a process called synaptic plasticity. We believe our therapeutic approach, which modulates NMDArs to enhance synaptic plasticity, affecting learning and memory, holds great promise for alleviating multiple disorders of the brain and nervous system, such as cognitive impairment, PTSD, chronic pain, and depression.
 The foundation of our proprietary discovery platform is the ability to modulate NMDArs in a highly specific and selective manner to enhance synaptic plasticity. Rather than fully turning the receptor “on” (agonism) or “off” (antagonism), we believe our approach effectively normalizes NMDAr function, enhancing communication between neural cells and avoiding the issues associated with excessive unidirectional activation or inhibition that have plagued NMDAr‑targeted drug development historically.

 In clinical studies, compounds generated from our discovery platform penetrate the blood brain barrier to achieve brain concentration levels consistent with levels observed at doses that had significant effects in various preclinical animal models. These product candidates are orally bioavailable, potentially suitable for once daily dosing, and have favorable tolerability profiles with little-to-no significant adverse events in studies completed to date. We believe these clinical data suggest that product candidates from our discovery platform may have wide dose ranges that are both safe and effective.
 Our strategy
 Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative therapies for disorders of the brain and nervous system with significant unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to:

· | Advance the development of NYX‑2925 as a novel treatment for chronic pain conditions. We believe NYX 2925, if approved, could be a high potential therapy for chronic pain with mechanistic innovations that address significant unmet medical needs. We plan to present detailed findings from the Phase 2 DPN study at the American Pain Society Scientific Meeting in April 2019 and we expect to complete the exploratory fibromyalgia study and report data from the study in the first half of 2019. Together, data from these first-in-patient studies inform and support the future development of NYX 2925 for the treatment of chronic pain.

· | Advance the development of NYX‑783 as a novel treatment for PTSD. We are currently evaluating NYX‑783 as a potential treatment for people with PTSD. We recently initiated a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NYX-783 in patients with PTSD and expect to report data from this study in the first half of 2020. We believe NYX‑783, if approved, could represent a transformative therapeutic option in PTSD that targets the underlying learning and memory dysfunction associated with an inability to extinguish fear caused by trauma, while also addressing the core symptoms and major comorbidities of the disorder.

· | Advance the development of NYX‑458 as a novel treatment for Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment. We are currently evaluating the safety and tolerability of NYX‑458 in a Phase 1 clinical study that we expect to complete and report data from in the first half of 2019. Based on compelling data in a highly relevant, translatable, non-human primate model, we believe NYX‑458, if approved, may offer substantial improvements over existing treatments for Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment. Our initial Phase 2 study will focus on Parkinson’s disease mild cognitive impairment, or PD-MCI.

· | Continue to expand our pipeline by leveraging our NMDAr modulator discovery platform, building on and extending our leadership in NMDAr biology. We intend to use our discovery platform to develop a broad pipeline and product portfolio across an array of disorders of the brain and nervous system. Our pipeline is fueled by our library of over 1,000 unique, synthesized, small‑molecule NMDAr modulators derived through our extensive original research and the discovery of a novel binding domain that we believe could allow for safe and effective enhancement of synaptic plasticity. All of these compounds have been designed to meet favorable central nervous system, or CNS safety and pharmacokinetic, or PK, criteria. We also plan to continue seeking NMDAr‑dependent biomarkers which could help to inform the development of our future product candidates.

· | Optimize the development and commercial potential of our product candidates. We own the worldwide commercial rights to NYX‑2925, NYX‑783, and NYX‑458 in our selected indications. Our primary strategy is to independently pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We have assembled an experienced management team that is capable of executing along the entire value chain of drug development and commercialization. As we continue to build and

develop our product portfolio, we may opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our pipeline.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Product candidates from our discovery platform
 The following table summarizes our pipeline and other product candidates generated from our discovery platform:

 While all of our product candidates and the other molecules from our discovery platform modulate NMDArs, they are each distinct chemical entities with different pharmacologic properties. Each of our molecules binds uniquely within the binding domain, resulting in a variety of activity, potency, and NMDAr‑subtype selectivity profiles. We evaluate the therapeutic implications of these variations by interrogating our molecules across different preclinical models of brain and nervous system disorders. The data we collect from these preclinical studies indicate which molecules are better suited for different indications and inform our development decisions accordingly.
 NYX‑2925
 NYX 2925 is a novel, oral, small molecule NMDAr modulator being developed for the treatment of chronic pain. NYX 2925 works by enhancing synaptic plasticity in the brain, a mechanism that is differentiated from any therapy currently used for the treatment of chronic pain. This approach is uniquely suited to treat chronic pain as it is established that, when pain becomes chronic (especially neuropathic pain), it becomes increasingly centrally (brain) mediated. The development of NYX 2925 in painful DPN has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
 Prevalence and market opportunity
 We estimate that up to 100 million adults in the United States suffer from chronic pain. While we believe NYX-2925 has the potential to address many chronic pain conditions, we estimate that the initial pain conditions we are targeting affect over 10 million people in the United States – approximately 5.5 million with painful DPN and more than 5 million with fibromyalgia.

 Phase 2 clinical studies
 Recently we announced that, in our Phase 2 study of NYX 2925 in patients with painful DPN, NYX-2925 demonstrated a very favorable safety profile with no serious adverse events reported. NYX-2925 did not show statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary endpoint of the study. However, signals of analgesic activity were observed and, in a very mechanistically relevant and large sub-group of patients with advanced DPN, NYX-2925 resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in pain and other symptoms. The data generated from this study inform and support future development of NYX-2925 for the treatment of chronic pain, specifically with regard to the most appropriate dose, patient population, and design to evaluate in future studies. We expect to present further detail from the study at the American Pain Society Scientific Meeting in April 2019. NYX-2925 is also currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 exploratory neuroimaging study in fibromyalgia. In an interim analysis of this study, NYX 2925 was shown to have significant effects on known pain processing markers in the brain, as measured through fMRI. NYX-2925 also exhibited correlated trends towards improvement on the patient-reported outcomes that are being assessed as secondary measures in this study. We expect to complete the exploratory study and report data from it in the first half of 2019. Based on the data from the interim analysis, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study in fibromyalgia in the second half of 2019. 
 Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy
 We recently completed our Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NYX 2925 in patients with painful DPN. This was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 300 patients across 35 U.S. based sites. Over the four-week treatment period, patients received daily oral doses of either placebo or NYX-2925. Placebo and multiple dose levels of NYX 2925 were evaluated, including 10mg, 50mg, and 200mg. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 manner across the four arms of the study. 
 Pain was assessed using a patient reported scale (with a pain score ranging from zero to ten) and recorded daily on a provided hand-held device. The study assessed daily pain scores at baseline (for seven days prior to treatment) and throughout the study duration with the primary endpoint being the change in pain score from baseline to week four, the final week of treatment. Additional endpoints measured a range of other physical and psychological parameters.
 To mitigate high placebo response rates like those seen in similar chronic pain studies, we used an algorithm based on baseline (pre-treatment) pain score reporting as part of the screening process for the study. Patients that exhibited pain reporting characteristics that have been correlated with higher standard deviation and placebo response in historical studies were excluded from the study prior to treatment. This proprietary, masked algorithm was intended to reduce the 

 
  7

 
variability observed in the study data and to help ensure a robust comparison of pain scores during and after treatment. The figure below illustrates the design of our Phase 2 study in patients with painful DPN.

 Results
 We recently reported top-line results from the study, NYX 2925 did not demonstrate statistically significant separation from placebo on the primary endpoint, change in patients’ average daily pain scores on the numeric rating scale, or NRS, during the final treatment week compared to baseline. NYX 2925 exhibited a very favorable safety profile with only placebo-like side effects and no treatment-related serious adverse events. Of the three dose levels evaluated, the 50 mg dose showed the most robust improvements across multiple measures – consistent with previous clinical and preclinical data suggesting the potential for an inverted “U-shaped” dose response with this mechanism. Importantly, the 50 mg dose did not appear to have reached maximal effect by week four, suggesting that a longer treatment period may result in continued improvement and larger drug effect. The graph below summarizes the top-line results in the total efficacy population (N=300) on the primary endpoint compared to placebo. 

 Note: All changes reflect change in least squares mean using a mixed effects repeated measures model.

 In the total efficacy population, those patients not taking a concomitant analgesic medication (N=148) showed a greater separation on average daily pain scores from placebo. The graph below shows the change in average pain compared to placebo in only those patients who were not taking a concomitant analgesic medication. 

 Note: All changes reflect difference in least squares mean change vs placebo using a mixed effects repeated measures model.
 In March 2019, we announced results from the detailed analysis of the full dataset from the study, which identified a very mechanistically relevant sub-group of patients in which NYX-2925 demonstrated a much greater treatment benefit. In this post-hoc analysis, patients with advanced DPN, or DPN for four years or longer, showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in average daily pain and also showed consistent robust improvements across the other endpoints measured in the study. This sub-group of patients is particularly relevant to the mechanism by which NYX-2925 is proposed to act. It is established that, as pain becomes chronic, it becomes increasingly centrally mediated and characterized by disrupted central processing in the brain. The proposed mechanism of NYX-2925 addresses the increasingly centralized pain perceived by advanced DPN patients when they experience prolonged chronic pain over a long period of time. This patient sub-group is not only mechanistically relevant, but also substantial in size, representing over 42% of the entire study population and allowing for rigorous analysis.

 The graph below depicts the placebo-adjusted change in average daily pain in the advanced DPN patient sub-group. 

     Note: All changes reflect difference in least squares mean change vs placebo using a mixed effects repeated measures model.
 These significant improvements were observed consistently across the other endpoints measured in the study, including worst daily pain, pain on walking, daily sleep interference, and others.
 Additionally, and consistent with the findings in the total study population, in advanced DPN patients who were not taking a concomitant analgesic medication, the observed effects of NYX-2925 were even more pronounced. In the 50 mg dose group, the separation from placebo improved to 1.85 points on the NRS at week 4 of treatment.
 Based on the safety and efficacy profile exhibited in the study, we believe NYX-2925 has significant potential to address major unmet needs in the treatment of chronic pain. Given the pronounced effects observed in the advanced DPN patient population in this study, we plan to initiate an additional study in painful DPN in the second half of 2019. We expect to present incremental detail on the results from the study at the American Pain Society Scientific Meeting in April 2019. 
 Fibromyalgia
 We are currently conducting an exploratory neuroimaging study in patients with fibromyalgia. The study is a single‑blind, placebo‑controlled study. We intend to enroll approximately 24 patients across two U.S.‑based academic sites evaluating daily doses of 20 mg and 200 mg.
 The goal of the study is to determine whether daily dosing of NYX‑2925 in patients with fibromyalgia changes certain biomarkers of central pain processing using various neuroimaging techniques, including fMRI. We are also evaluating additional endpoints, including daily pain scores, and a range of other physical and psychological parameters. Each subject serves as his or her own control, receiving both placebo and NYX‑2925 over the course of the six-week study.
 We reported positive results from an interim analysis of this exploratory fibromyalgia study in December 2018. We expect to complete the study and report data in the first half of 2019. Based on the results from the interim analysis, we expect to initiate a larger Phase 2 study in patients with fibromyalgia in the second half of 2019.

 Results of interim analysis
 In the interim analysis conducted in December of 2018, NYX‑2925 was shown to significantly reduce pain-evoked glutamate release in the insular cortex, reduce connectivity between the insular cortex and default mode network, significantly reduce combined glutamate and glutamine levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and change other connectivity patterns associated with central pain processing. In aggregate, these data suggest that NYX-2925 has an antinociceptive profile. In addition to the positive results shown on the primary imaging endpoints, NYX‑2925 also showed favorable corresponding trends on the secondary, patient reported, measures including daily pain scores, fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, and cognition. The interim analysis results provide support to advance NYX‑2925 in development for the treatment of fibromyalgia. This study is ongoing, and we expect to complete the study and report data from it in the first half of 2019.
 Future development
 We intend to advance NYX‑2925 towards regulatory approval for the treatment of painful DPN and fibromyalgia. In addition, we intend to pursue broader chronic pain indications for NYX‑2925, including neuropathic lower‑back pain, and osteoarthritis.
 As well as pursing FDA approval in the United States in these indications, we also plan to explore registrations outside of the United States in the most attractive markets, including but not limited to the European Union, Japan, Canada, Australia, and large emerging markets such as China.
 NYX‑783
 NYX‑783 is a novel, oral, small‑molecule NMDAr modulator in development for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. In a Phase 1 study, NYX‑783 demonstrated a predictable, dose dependent, and linear PK profile with no accumulation after multiple daily doses and was well‑tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events. As evaluated through cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, exposure, NYX-783 adequately crosses the blood brain barrier and achieves CNS concentration levels in line with the most efficacious preclinical doses with a similar plasma-to-brain concentration ratio as that observed in rats. We recently initiated a Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NYX-783 in patients with PTSD and expect to report data from this study in the first half of 2020. Preclinical data suggest that NYX‑783 may accelerate fear extinction and inhibit spontaneous fear, potentially addressing a key underlying learning and memory dysfunction associated with PTSD. The development of NYX‑783 for the treatment of PTSD has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA and we believe NYX‑783, if approved, may represent a significant improvement over current treatments for PTSD.
 Prevalence and market opportunity
 It is estimated that 8% to 10% of people that experience trauma will develop PTSD in their lifetime and approximately 8.5 million people currently suffer from PTSD in the United States. Many of these people are currently untreated or poorly treated due to the lack of safe and effective options. To date only two pharmacotherapies have been approved to treat PTSD and both are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI, antidepressants that have limited efficacy in treating the symptoms of PTSD.
 Phase 2a clinical study
 We recently initiated a first-in-patient Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of NYX-783 in patients with PTSD. The overarching objective of this study is to inform future studies of NYX-783 on the most appropriate dosing regimen, enrollment criteria, and endpoints to best assess the overall impact of NYX-783 on PTSD symptoms. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will enroll approximately 144 patients. After confirming eligibility and PTSD diagnosis, patients will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or 50 mg of NYX-783 over the course of the eight-week study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the improvement from baseline on the sub scores and total score of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, or the CAPS-5. Alongside the primary endpoint, numerous 

 
  11

 
secondary and exploratory endpoints, exploratory biomarkers, and pharmacodynamic measures are being evaluated in the study. The study is being conducted in two stages, each lasting four weeks. In the first stage, patients will be randomized to placebo or 50 mg of NYX-783 with an overweighting to placebo. At the completion of the first stage, placebo responders and non-responders will be identified in a blinded fashion and each group will then be re-randomized to placebo or 50 mg of NYX-783. Patients that received NYX-783 in the first stage will receive placebo in the second stage. The primary analysis for efficacy in this study will include the groups on NYX-783 and placebo in the first stage and the placebo non-responder group on both NYX-783 and placebo from the second stage. We will also be able to evaluate the durability of effect of NYX-783 through the patients that receive placebo in the second stage after receiving NYX-783 in the first stage.
 This study is designed as a proof-of-concept study aimed to characterize the safety and efficacy of NYX-783 and to inform future development for the treatment of PTSD. The various elements of its design are expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of NYX-783 in the treatment of PTSD. 
 Future development
 We intend to advance NYX‑783 towards regulatory approval for the treatment of PTSD. In addition, we may pursue other neuropsychiatric indications for NYX‑783.
 As well as pursing FDA approval in the United States in these indications, we also plan to explore registrations outside of the United States in the most attractive markets, including but not limited to the European Union, Japan, Canada, Australia, and large emerging markets such as China.
 NYX‑458
 NYX-458 is a novel, oral, small-molecule NMDAr modulator in development for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment. We are currently evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of NYX‑458 in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers, which we expect to complete and report data from in the first half of 2019. Mechanistic rationale and compelling preclinical data in numerous models of cognitive impairment suggest NYX‑458 may be optimally suited to treat cognitive deficits associated with Parkinson’s disease. 
 Prevalence and market opportunity
 Parkinson’s disease is believed to be the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, behind Alzheimer’s disease. According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, Parkinson’s disease affects approximately one million people in the United States and nearly ten million worldwide. It is estimated that there are nearly 60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s disease diagnosed annually in the United States and as the population continues to age, it is anticipated that the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease will continue to grow. The emergence and progression of cognition‑related symptoms in Parkinson’s disease can vary due to the diverse underlying pathology of the disease; however, mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is an early non‑motor symptom, and affects 15% to 25% of newly diagnosed patients. It is estimated that approximately 30% of people living with Parkinson’s disease have Parkinson’s disease dementia, or PDD, and studies estimate that as people with Parkinson’s disease approach ten years post‑diagnosis, 75% will have PDD. Based on these percentages, we estimate that there are more than 500,000 people in the United States with either PD‑MCI or PDD.
 Ongoing Phase 1 clinical study
 We are conducting a Phase 1 study, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019. This is a randomized, double-blind, sponsor-open, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose, parallel safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics study of NYX‑458 dosed orally in healthy volunteers.
 Non-human primate model of Parkinson’s Disease Cognitive Impairment
 We have evaluated NYX-458 in a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment. This model is highly relevant and translatable, as it evaluates the product candidate’s effects in non‑human primates by employing the 

 
  12

 
neurotoxin MPTP to deplete dopamine‑related neural cells similar to the way Parkinson’s disease does in humans and measuring cognitive function using the same battery of tests used in human clinical studies. In a study using this model, oral administration of NYX‑458 resulted in a reversal of MPTP‑induced cognitive impairment and, on some measures, restored cognitive function back to pre‑MPTP baseline levels. The graph below depicts the effect observed in one assay from this model following a single administration of NYX-458.
        
 *MPTP is a neurotoxin used to deplete dopamine-related neuronal cells – similar to the way Parkinson’s disease does in humans.
 Future development
 We intend to develop NYX‑458 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment.
 We are planning our Phase 2 safety and efficacy programs for NYX‑458 within Parkinson’s disease and are also considering other causes of cognitive impairment. We believe the mechanism of NYX‑458 may be effective across cognitive impairment due to varying etiologies. Based on the results seen in the initial studies in the model of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment, we may seek to expand clinical development to other diseases associated with cognitive impairment.
 AGN‑241751
 Through our research collaboration, Allergan has advanced one compound from our discovery platform into Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder. In May 2018, Allergan exercised its option under our collaboration to acquire the exclusive intellectual property rights specific to such compound, triggering payment of a $1.0 million option fee in connection with such exercise. We will receive no further economic consideration from this product candidate. For more information, see “Research collaboration agreement with Allergan” below.

 Competition
 Overview
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large and growing markets for pain, PTSD, Parkinson’s disease, and other disorders of the brain and nervous system make them attractive therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical businesses. While we believe that our employees and consultants, scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Several of these entities have commercial products, robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 NMDAr‑targeted therapies
 A number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies are developing therapies targeting NMDArs. Most of the therapies being developed are broad antagonists and tend to have multiple target actions while our compounds are truly modulatory and have not demonstrated any off‑target activity in preclinical screening. We are aware of other companies developing or commercializing NMDAr‑targeted therapies, including but not limited to, Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc., Allergan plc, AmKor Pharma, Inc., Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Axsome Therapeutics, Inc., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. Ltd., Cadent Therapeutics, Inc., Cerecor Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Genentech Inc., Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc., Intra‑Cellular Therapies, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., NeuroRx, Inc., Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., Otonomy, Inc., Relmada Therapeutics, Inc., Sage Therapeutics, Inc., UCB S.A., and Vistagen Therapeutics, Inc.
 NYX‑2925—neuropathic/chronic pain
 We expect that, if approved, NYX‑2925 will compete with the currently approved therapies for painful DPN, including pregabalin, duloxetine, and tapentadol HCl. We are aware of a number of therapies that are approved to treat other types of neuropathic pain. We are also aware that various therapies are used off‑label to treat neuropathic pain. In addition to the marketed therapies, we are aware of companies currently developing therapies for neuropathic pain, including Biogen Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Eli Lilly and Company, GW Pharmaceuticals plc., Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc., NeuroBo Pharmaceuticals, Novaremed AG, Novartis AG, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, ViroMed Inc., and Xenoport Inc.
 NYX‑783—post traumatic stress disorder
 We expect that, if approved, NYX‑783 will compete with currently approved therapies for PTSD, including paroxetine and sertraline. We are also aware of other companies developing therapies for PTSD, including but not limited to, Azevan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bionomics Ltd., Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., SpringWorks Therapeutics, and Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.

 
  14

 

 NYX‑458—Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment
 We expect that, if approved, NYX‑458 will compete with currently approved therapies for PDD, the only one of which in the United States is rivastigmine. There are no therapies currently approved for Parkinson’s mild cognitive impairment in the United States. We are also aware of other companies developing therapies for Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment, including but not limited to, Anavex Life Sciences, Eli Lilly and Company, and Eisai Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 Research collaboration agreement with Allergan
 Overview
 In July 2015, we entered into the Allergan Research Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we and Allergan have research, development, and commercial rights to compounds discovered using our discovery platform. The research collaboration was structured to afford Allergan an option to obtain field‑limited rights for up to three of the compounds discovered under the research collaboration. In exchange for these rights, Allergan reimburses us for a certain percentage of the direct costs associated with the medicinal chemistry, screening, and profiling efforts conducted as part of the research collaboration. Allergan also pays us a fixed annual rate per full time employee, or FTE, for each individual assigned to these discovery efforts. Our research activities are supervised by a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, comprising representatives from both our company and Allergan.
 Under the Allergan Research Collaboration Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform research activities in accordance with the research collaboration. We propose target compound profiles for use in identifying, discovering, and developing collaboration compounds most suitable for further research and development under the collaboration. Molecules from our discovery platform that meet our mutually agreed upon criteria are designated as “eligible compounds.” When the pool of eligible compounds reaches a certain size, Allergan and we may select, in alternating fashion, molecules from this pool for further investigation.
 Allergan may perform research and development on (but not commercialize) molecules it selects as therapies for Alzheimer’s disease, delirium and a list of psychiatric disorders (which list does not include PTSD or substance abuse). On May 16, 2018, Allergan exercised its option to acquire the compound designated AGN‑241751, triggering payment of a $1.0 million option fee in connection with such exercise. Allergan may also exercise up to two more options to acquire commercialization rights to molecules that it previously selected from the pool of eligible compounds. Under this agreement, each time Allergan exercises its option, it is required to pay us an option exercise fee of $1.0 million and we must (a) assign to Allergan rights in intellectual property that pertains only to the Allergan‑optioned compound, and (b) grant Allergan a fully‑paid, perpetual, exclusive and irrevocable license under other intellectual property we control that pertains to both the optioned compound and also pertains to other compounds or uses, solely to develop and commercialize the optioned compound within Allergan’s field of specified indications.
 We may research and develop molecules we select from the pool of eligible compounds as therapies for any indication outside of Allergan’s field of specified indications. We anticipate we will invent, and therefore own, most intellectual property pertaining to our selected compounds, but Allergan must grant us a non‑exclusive license under any intellectual property rights Allergan may own related to our selected compounds to develop and commercialize our selected compounds outside of Allergan’s field of specified indications.
 During the exclusivity period set forth in the agreement, we have agreed not to, alone or with a third party, directly or indirectly, engage in the research, preclinical development, clinical development, or commercialization of any compound or any product for the purpose of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any disorders or conditions in Allergan’s field of specified indications. In addition, any chemistry or technology we discover or develop related to the modulation of NMDArs for therapeutic effect is and will be subject to the terms of the agreement. Allergan and its affiliates will not have the right to, alone or with a third party, directly or indirectly, engage in the research, preclinical development, clinical development, or commercialization of the compounds it acquires under the research collaboration for the purpose of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of any disorders or conditions outside Allergan’s field of specified 

 
  15

 
indications, without first obtaining Aptinyx approval at our sole discretion. The exclusivity period commences on the effective date of the agreement and ends on the third anniversary of the last day of the term of the agreement.
 The Allergan Research Collaboration Agreement expires on the expiration of Allergan’s options. The term for Allergan’s options expires on February 24, 2021; provided that such period would be extended as needed to permit Aptinyx to provide a complete data package to Allergan for the Allergan selected compounds. The option period (and the research collaboration agreement) would terminate prior to expiration if and when Allergan exercises a third option under the research collaboration agreement. Allergan may terminate the Allergan Research Collaboration Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice upon the other party’s filing for protection under bankruptcy or insolvency laws. In the event we are in material breach of one or more of our material obligations under the agreement, then Allergan may terminate the agreement and the exclusivity period will remain in effect until a predetermined anniversary of the date that would have been the expiration date if the research term had run its full course without extension. Upon termination of the research collaboration agreement, the research program will terminate, rights to molecules that were previously optioned by Allergan will continue in effect, and all molecules, and associated data, for which Allergan has selected but not exercised an option will be returned to us and will no longer be subject to any Allergan rights.
 This collaboration has enabled both parties to advance compounds from our discovery platform into clinical studies.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
 As a key part of our product development approach, we aim to complete formulation work at an early stage of development, such that our clinical studies are conducted with a formulation that has the potential for eventual scale‑up.
 All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process, although certain manufacturers may choose to manufacture our product candidates in specifically isolated facilities since many are spiro‑beta lactams. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost‑effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Commercialization
 We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates in the United States. We may work in combination with one or more large pharmaceutical partners for certain indications, where specialist capabilities are needed. Depending on the specific development path pursued, this may include larger chronic pain indications. For other, more specialized indications, we intend to commercialize our product candidates independently. For example, we believe the patient and prescriber populations for Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment are relatively concentrated and can be addressed with a focused sales team of fewer than 200 full time employees. We also do not believe any existing pharmaceutical companies have significant expertise in the commercialization of therapies in this specific area. We will, however, continuously review our partnering strategy in the light of new clinical data and market understanding. We may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions outside the United States.
 Intellectual property
 Our owned patents and patent applications relate to our NMDAr modulating compounds and include patents and patent applications directed to new compositions of matter and to methods of treating brain and nervous system disorders. We intend to seek patent protection in the United States and in selected jurisdictions worldwide.

 NYX‑2925 and NYX‑783
 As of March 18, 2019, we own two issued U.S. patents, and pending and issued foreign counterpart patents and patent applications, that relate to both NYX‑2925 and NYX‑783. We also own one pending U.S. patent application and one pending U.S. provisional patent application that relate to NYX‑2925, and one pending U.S. patent application that relates to NYX‑783. A provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non‑provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of the provisional patent application. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2034. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file a non‑provisional patent application with respect to our latest filed provisional patent application, and if any patents issue based on such pending applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2039.
 NYX‑458
 As of March 18, 2019, we own one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and pending foreign counterpart patent applications, that relate to our product candidate, NYX‑458. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2037. If we continue to pursue patent protection, and if any patents issue based on our pending applications, we expect such patents to expire in 2037.
 Other compounds
 As of March 18, 2019, we own seven issued U.S. patents, thirteen pending U.S. patent applications, and pending and issued foreign counterpart patents and patent applications, as well as six international PCT patent applications and ten U.S. provisional patent applications, all of which generally relate to our efforts to develop other compounds in our NMDAr modulator small‑molecule program. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non‑provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file one or more non‑provisional patent applications with respect to our pending provisional patent applications, and if any patents issue based on our pending applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2040.
 For a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our intellectual property rights.”
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record‑keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 U.S. drug development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, a manufacturer may need to recall a product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical study site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical studies in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical study‑related regulations, referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non‑human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. These nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical studies, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30‑day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an 

 
  18

 
IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the study to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and completed clinical study results to public registries.
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, upon request, the FDA is to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools. A drug development tool includes a biomarker including a surrogate endpoint, a clinical outcome assessment including a patient‑reported outcome, and any other method, material or measure that the FDA determines aids drug development and regulatory review. A drug development tool is qualified if the FDA has determined that the tool and its proposed context of use can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and application in drug development and regulatory review. A qualified drug development tool may be used to support the investigational use of a drug or support or obtain NDA approval.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical study outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical study under an IND. If a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical study to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical study is conducted in compliance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
 Clinical studies
 Clinical studies are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies.

· | Phase 1 clinical studies generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical studies typically involve studies in disease‑affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits and provide a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical studies generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical studies may include comparisons with placebo and/or comparator treatments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Post‑approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic 

 
  19

 
indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical studies as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, finding from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Additionally, a sponsor must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life‑threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study.
 Pursuant to the Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
 Concurrently with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA review process
 The results of the nonclinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $2,588,478. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($309,915). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing 

 
  20

 
within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, for drugs that do not contain an NCE, the FDA has 10 months from the receipt date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the receipt date for a priority NDA. For drugs containing an NCE, these ten- and six-month review timeframes are from the filing date of an NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical studies to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re‑analyze the clinical study data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(s), and/or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical studies, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post‑marketing testing or clinical studies and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug’s safety and efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA also may place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.

 Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off‑label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under the Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
 Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

 
  22

 

 Pediatric trials
 The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed‑upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical studies and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post‑marketing requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the FDA of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off‑label use”), limitations on industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off‑label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off‑label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical studies. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be 

 
  23

 
established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Changes in statutes, regulations, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record‑keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

 Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be preapproved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents having claims that cover the applicant’s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
 Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent will expire and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30‑month stay.
 In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30‑month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant 

 
  24

 
period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 U.S. marketing exclusivity
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. The FDCA also provides a five‑year period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. While we believe there is a likelihood that the FDA would grant NCE status to both NYX‑2925 and NYX‑783 if both are granted regulatory approval, NYX‑2925 and NYX‑783 have the same structural formula but differ in spatial orientation, i.e., are separate stereoisomers of each other, and there can be no assurance that both will be granted NCE exclusivity. Three‑year and five‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six‑month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA‑issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 U.S. patent‑term extension
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates or any future product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension (and only those patient claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended), and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of patent term for our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there can be no assurance that the USPTO will grant us any requested patent term extension, either for the length we request or at all.

 Other regulatory matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services including the Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local regulatory authorities. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison (per violation), criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off‑label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third‑party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, , willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that any of our product candidates, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.

 
  26

 

 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.  
 Other regulations may affect other aspects of our business. For example, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child‑resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the 

 
  27

 
curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 European Union drug development
 In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical studies regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical studies in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical study can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the study is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical study have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will apply in 2019 with a three‑year transition period. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical studies in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications.
 European Union drug review and approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, comprising the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto‑immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned 

 
  28

 
raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk‑benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies.
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
 In the EU, the European Commission, based on the recommendation of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period is extended by two years for compliance with an agreed upon pediatric investigation plan granted at the time of review of the orphan drug designation. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time, if (i) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application, (ii) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of the orphan medicinal product, or (iii) the second applicant can establish that the second medicinal product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 European data collection
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (or GDPR), which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EU. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data (including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements) and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the 

 
  29

 
related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non‑material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Rest of the world regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third‑party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor by payor basis. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that any required patient cost‑sharing amount will be acceptable to the patient. Moreover, one payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time‑consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.    Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is: 
· | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


· | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


· | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

  We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
 Third‑party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net 

 
  30

 
revenue and results. Decreases in third‑party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third‑party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:

· | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% (70% commencing January 1, 2019) point‑of‑sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  31

 

beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | established a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.

  Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost‑sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently finalized regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax‑based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA‑mandated fees, including the so‑called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer‑sponsored insurance plan, the annual fee imposed on certain high cost employer‑sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device exercise tax on non‑exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, CMS announced that it is suspending further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program pending the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018

the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. 
 Congress also could consider additional legislation to repeal, replace, or further modify elements of the ACA. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, or any law replacing elements of it, and the political uncertainty regarding any repeal and replacement on the ACA, on our business remains unclear. Many of the details regarding the implementation of the ACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the ACA would have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to the ACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future.
 Moreover, in May 2018, the Trump administration released its “Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out‑of‑Pocket Costs,” or the Blueprint. The Blueprint contains several potential regulatory actions and legislative recommendations aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, including measures to promote innovation and competition for biologics, changes to Medicare Part D to give plan sponsors more leverage when negotiating prices with manufacturers, and updating the Medicare drug‑pricing dashboard to make price increases and generic competition more transparent. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Request for Information, or RFI, soliciting public input on ways to lower drug pricing. Together, the recommendations in the Blueprint and RFI, if enacted by Congress and HHS, could lead to changes to Medicare Parts B and D, including the transition of certain drugs covered under Part B to Part D or the offering of alternative purchasing options under the Competitive Acquisition Program that currently applies to selected drugs and biologics covered under Part B. In September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. While most of the proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative, administrative and/or additional measures to control drug costs.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. Further, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.
 Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
