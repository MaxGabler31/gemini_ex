Business Overview
 
We are a global provider of a wide range of environmental, compliance and waste management services. Our broad range of capabilities and global reach enable us to meet the critical, and often non-discretionary, needs of more than 5,000 customers across diverse end markets to ensure compliance with environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) laws and regulations around the world. Our diverse service offerings and broad geographic footprint enable us to reach customers around the world to:

● | ensure compliance with international and domestic EH&S laws and regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maximize operating efficiency and longevity of critical operating assets; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ensure adherence with their EH&S policies; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduce risk and liability; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enhance safety; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduce downtime of critical operations; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | protect the environment from potentially dangerous materials and waste streams. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The services we provide to our customers are highly-regulated often considered by our customers to be non-discretionary due to the high costs of failure, non-compliance and negative public and community relations. Our business is diversified and combines technical expertise, broad geographic reach, differentiated assets, essential regulatory certifications and a specialized work force that allows us to address customers’ on-going environmental and regulatory requirements. We have broad global reach, with approximately 75 locations in the United States and approximately 20 additional locations internationally across eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Mexico, Turkey, the Republic of Georgia, United Arab Emirates, Angola, Thailand and Trinidad and Tobago.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 952 Echo Lane, Suite 460, Houston, Texas 77024 and our telephone number at that location is (832)767-4749.
 
We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Our SEC filings are available to the public through the Internet at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge on our Internet website at ir.nrcg.com all of the documents that we file with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file those documents with the SEC. The information on or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference into, or otherwise made part of, this Report.
 
Strategic Transactions
 
Business Combination
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in January 2017 as Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. III (“Hennessy Capital”), a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
On October 17, 2018, Hennessy Capital acquired NRC Group Holdings, LLC (“NRC Group”), a Delaware limited liability company, which was established in June 2018 through the combination of two businesses, JFL-NRC Holdings, LLC (“NRC”) and Sprint Energy Services, LLC (“Sprint”), both previously operating separately under the ownership of investment affiliates of J.F. Lehman & Company, LLC (“JFLCo”). Hennessy Capital acquired of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of NRC Group from JFL-NRC-SES Partners, LLC (“JFL Partners”) in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2018 and amended as of July 12, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”), between Hennessy Capital and JFL Partners (the “Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the total purchase price of $394.7 million was paid to JFL Partners in a combination of cash and in shares of common stock.

Business Segments
 
We operate in four reportable business segments: (1) Domestic Environmental Services, (2) Sprint, (3) Domestic Standby Services and (4) International Services.
 
Domestic Environmental Services
 
Our Domestic Environmental Services segment provides essential environmental and industrial services to energy, engineering and construction, environmental, health care, industrial, maritime, railroad, transportation and other customers across the United States. We believe that we are one of only a few companies in the United States that provides a broad array of environmental services nationally. The Domestic Environmental Services segment’s wide-ranging suite of specialized environmental and industrial services (the “environmental services”) includes:

● | industrial cleaning; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | hazardous waste packaging and management; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | waste transportation and disposal; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2

 


● | marine cleaning and marine services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | salvage support; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | petroleum storage tank cleaning and removal; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pipeline repair; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | site remediation services; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | land-and marine-based emergency response; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | specialized equipment rental. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On average, we perform more than 20,000 projects annually for over 3,000 customers, which include multi-national corporations and municipalities across numerous geographies and end markets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no one customer made up over 5% of annual revenue. Overall demand for our Domestic Environmental Services is generally linked to levels of industrial production and gross domestic product (“GDP”). Our Domestic Environmental Services customers’ utilization of our environmental services for routine maintenance and response services results in a highly visible, recurring revenue stream. These Domestic Environmental Services are high-frequency, legally-mandated, recurring, small-ticket projects with an average project amount of under $15,000 and a broad base of customers.
 
In addition to providing ongoing, day-to-day services, our Domestic Environmental Services segment also performs special or large clean-up projects in response to unplanned events, spills or leaks. Our new Global Emergency Response program offers a single-source solution for emergency response services to transportation, chemical distribution, retail, waste management, industrial and insurance companies. Typically, our customers seek a highly-qualified, national provider of services who offers a reliable and safe service model at a reasonable cost. Our Domestic Environmental Services segment operates a 24 hours a day, 7 days per week (“24/7”) emergency response call center to support the needs of our customers. Upon receiving an emergency response request, we dispatch resources from one of over 65 strategically located service locations. In addition, we have the capability of using one of our nearly 200 independent contractors with whom we have existing support agreements to ensure that our customers’ needs are promptly met. We currently anticipate performing a significant percentage of these projects using internal resources to execute our growth strategy and maximize earnings.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Domestic Environmental Services segment earned approximately $164.5, $171.0 and $226.4, respectively, in revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, segment revenue represented approximately 62.9% of total company revenue.
 
Sprint
 
Our Sprint segment provides energy-related services and waste disposal services predominately to upstream energy customers currently concentrated in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins. Our Sprint segment provides energy-related services to over 300 customers from four service facilities located in Kennedy, Carrizo Springs, Midland and Pecos, Texas. Our energy-related services include:

● | spill containment and site remediation; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | equipment cleaning & maintenance services; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | specialty equipment rental, including tanks, pumps and containment; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | safety monitoring and management; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | transportation and disposal; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also operate a waste disposal facility in Kennedy, Texas (the “Karnes County facility”), which services the full complement of oil and gas waste streams, including:
 

● | oil-and water-based drill cuttings and muds; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | tank-bottom sediment and produced frac sands; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3

 


● | contaminated soils; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | gels, cements or other liquids containing solids; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | other production-related waste. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Karnes County facility is a landfill facility that operates 24/7 and is designed and engineered specifically for oil and gas waste streams. The Karnes County facility is strategically located in the core of the Eagle Ford Shale Basin. The Karnes County facility is permitted and regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas. In addition, it is constructed to the specifications set forth under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), which exceed the standard required for oil and gas waste streams. Set on approximately 390 contiguous acres, the Karnes County facility has capacity for foreseeable demand across multiple decades, including approximately 70 acres immediately available for development and another 200 acres available for future expansion. The Karnes County facility also provides on-site tank and truck washout services. The Karnes County facility has a demonstrated history of meaningful market share gain driven by our unique value proposition for our customers.
 
We are in the process of expanding our waste disposal capabilities into the Permian Basin to meet the growing demands of our existing Sprint and Domestic Environmental Services customers. In addition, the new facilities will provide us strategic access to new customers in the Delaware and Midland Basins. On October 2, 2018, we acquired Quail Run, which operates five domestic wastewater treatment facilities in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale regions. On October 11, 2018, we received a permit for our landfill facility located in Pecos County, Texas (the “Pecos County facility”), which lies within the Permian Basin. On October 22, 2018, we received a permit for a second Permian Basin landfill facility located in Reagan County, Texas (the “Reagan County facility”). Operations at the Pecos County and Reagan County facilities are expected to commence in early 2019. Additionally, we have one pending permit for a waste disposal site in Andrews County, Texas and expect to receive approval in the first half of 2019. Modeled on the success of the Karnes County facility, our new Permian Basin facilities are expected to result in similar customer adoption rates.
 
The locations of the new Permian Basin waste disposal sites were selected based on direct conversations and feedback from our existing Sprint and Domestic Environmental Services customers, who are key operators in the Permian Basin and anticipated to serve as anchor accounts. We believe that our waste disposal facilities generate attractive unit economics. We believe that the new Permian Basin facilities have potential to generate operational results similar to those that have been achieved at the Karnes County facility once fully operational. These facilities provide attractive returns on invested capital with a relatively fast expected payback period and an average useful life of a facility measured in decades.
 
Our existing and planned disposal facilities are strategically located in highly attractive sub basins, specifically within the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins, which have historically provided attractive economics for high quality operators. In the Eagle Ford and Permian Basins, breakeven costs have continued to move lower, driven primarily by advances in technology, efficiency gains and well performance resulting in lower costs of extraction. These basins typically have some of the lowest breakeven prices per barrel, as compared to other basins. A lower breakeven price per barrel helps to reduce the volatility in activity among operators during oil price fluctuations.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Sprint segment earned approximately $14.1, $45.1 and $75.2, respectively, in revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, segment revenue represented approximately 20.9% of total company revenue. Approximately 63.2% of segment revenue was generated by our energy-related services and 36.8% by our waste disposal services.
 
Domestic Standby Services
 
Our Domestic Standby Services segment is a global provider of commercial standby oil spill compliance and emergency response services (the “standby services”) in the United States and across North America. Our Domestic Standby Services customers pay annual retainer fees under long-term or evergreen contracts for access to regulatory certifications, specialized assets and highly trained personnel, who are on call 24/7 to respond to an oil spill or other hazardous materials emergency response events.
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), a regulatory framework for the protection of the environment from oil spills following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill, mandates certain oil spill response coverage for companies that store, transport, produce or handle petroleum and certain non-petroleum oils on or near U.S. waters.

Our Domestic Standby Services segment is the only commercial Oil Spill Response Organization (“OSRO”) in the United States and the only commercial provider of standby services that satisfies the requirements of both OPA-90 and other federal, state and municipal requirements. In addition, we hold the highest oil spill contractor classification offered by the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”). Our Domestic Standby Services segment maintains an installed base of specialized oil spill response equipment and highly trained personnel around the United States to ensure rapid response capabilities. We provide government-mandated standby compliance solutions to more than 2,000 customers that cover approximately 20,000 assets, including tank and non-tank vessels, barges, petrochemical facilities, pipelines, refineries and other assets. Our specialized fleet, highly-trained personnel and dedication to efficient, safe service delivery has resulted in over 99% annual customer retention and an average customer tenure of over 12 years.
 
Contracts with terms of five years or more accounted for approximately 85% of our Domestic Standby Services revenue, of which over half was generated by contracts with durations of ten or more years. Historically, approximately 80% of our Domestic Standby Services revenues were generated from retainer-based revenues, and approximately 20% were generated by emergency response services events, which tend to fluctuate slightly year to year. During a typical year, we respond to approximately 40 to 50 spills domestically, but the majority of our revenue is derived from the recurring retainer payments we receive from customers year after year. These retainer payments are government-mandated under OPA-90 requirements and, as a result, are independent of activity levels or commodity price fluctuations
 
Additionally, our internal Domestic Standby Services capability is augmented by our network of over 200 independent contractors throughout the United States to ensure expedient response times in any location. These independent contractors provide both personnel and, if required, equipment, to meet the immediate needs of our customers. Contractors must meet stringent requirements to become part of our network. Our contractors are paid when an event occurs and, as such, do not receive any of our annual standby retainer payments.
 
Our Domestic Standby Services segment is a high-margin, recurring, retainer-based business model that provides opportunity for incremental marine spill response revenue. To the extent a Domestic Standby Services retainer customer has a spill incident, we coordinate and manage the spill response by leveraging both internal resources and our independent contractor network. We generate incremental revenue with respect to services provided through internal resources and independent contractors on all response events, in addition to the annual retainer payments we collect each year.
 
Our Domestic Standby Services required a substantial upfront investment, but subsequently are relatively low cost to operate. As a result, segment contribution margin is very high, with the majority of incremental revenue flowing through to Adjusted EBITDA given the expansive infrastructure that is already in place. These services are government-mandated for our customers and serve as a low-cost yet invaluable “insurance policy” in the event of an incident. High barriers to entry, driven by the high cost of infrastructure necessary to achieve economies of scale, the high cost of failure, and regulatory certification requirements, have resulted in minimal new market competitors since market inception. Demand for these services is expected to continue to grow as domestic and international oil and gas production and exports continue to increase.
 
Mexico, which is currently included within our Domestic Standby Services segment, represents a significant growth opportunity for us. The recently privatized Mexican oil and gas market has resulted in the Mexican government actively auctioning off blocks for offshore exploration to leading global oil companies. Although OPA-90 only applies to U.S. territories, the Mexican government and many leading global and U.S.-based companies seek OSRO-type coverage similar to that required in the United States. Our primary Domestic Standby Services competitor is currently unable to operate outside of U.S. waters, which leaves us well-positioned to be the provider of choice for these services internationally. Our first-mover advantage has helped us become the leading OSRO in Mexico with nearly all of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 oil spill response market in Mexico. Based on our internal projections, we believe this could become an approximately $50 million market within the next five years.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Domestic Standby Services segment earned approximately $29.6, $43.8 and $34.1, respectively, in revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, segment revenue represented approximately 9.5% of total company revenue.
 
International Services
 
Our International Services segment provides industrial, emergency response and drainage services. Industrial service activities include tank cleaning, high pressure jetting and waste management services to the offshore oil and gas sector in the North Sea and a wide range of land-based industries. Following our acquisition of Clean Line in 2018, our industrial service activities also include drainage inspection, cleaning and repair services in the United Kingdom. We also provide services to a diverse range of sectors, including construction, highways, utilities, government and industry. Our international emergency activities include standby oil spill and emergency response services to the international oil and gas sector, which is not governed by U.S. OPA-90 regulations.
 
5

 

Our International Services segment currently operates in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Georgia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. This segment also works with partners in Angola, Trinidad & Tobago and Thailand utilizing pre-positioned equipment.
 
Our International Services segment serves approximately 350 customers, with some customer relationships dating back to 2004. Our International Services segment benefits from these long standing relationships, which help to better position our company as a global provider of comprehensive environmental, compliance and waste management services.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, the International Services segment earned approximately $23.5, $17.7 and $24.4, respectively, in revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, segment revenue represented approximately 6.8% of total company revenue.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Comprehensive Service Offering
 
Our unique scope and breadth of legally-mandated and mission-critical services allow us to provide integrated environmental and industrial service solutions to more than 5,000 customers worldwide. We provide our customers with a single point of contact to handle the full scope of their planned and unplanned environmental and industrial service needs. These services are complemented by our excellent safety record, our capability for 24/7 emergency response, and our market-leading regulatory accreditations, fleet management and environmental compliance. Further, our service offerings are complemented by industry-leading infrastructure, which includes specialized equipment, strategic disposal facilities, a 24/7 operations center and multi-mode service capabilities.
National Scale with Global Service Capabilities
 
We are one of the few large scale providers offering comprehensive and legally-mandated environmental and regulatory compliance services on a global scale, with the majority of the industry consisting of over 3,000 smaller local and regional firms. This is accomplished through our more than 75 locations in the United States and approximately 20 additional locations across eight countries, supplemented by our broad network of independent contractors, which includes more than 200 emergency response companies with over 500 locations. Additionally, our marine resource network provides us with priority access to an extensive network of marine assets, and our aerial resource network enables us to coordinate cargo logistics and dispersant services, with priority access to more than 30 helicopters and 15 fixed-wing planes. Our rapid response capabilities and strategically-located facilities enable us to rapidly deploy assets and personnel within 24 hours depending on the proximity of necessary equipment.
Specialized Asset Base and Essential Regulatory Certifications
 
We maintain a specialized asset base and essential regulatory certifications to respond to environmental events anytime and anywhere our customers need. We have over $150 million in insured value of vessels, marine equipment, vehicles, rolling stock and other equipment that requires extensive training and expertise to operate. Replacing or replicating our fleet of vessels and barges utilized by our Standby Services segment would be difficult and costly for potential competitors because our vessels are customized with oil spill recovery equipment and other vessel modifications specifically designed to enhance our effectiveness.
 
Although our average Standby Services fleet age is over 40+ years old, our vessels and barges are required by the USCG to be dry-docked two times every five years. As a result, we believe the fleet’s age is not a useful indicator of the life of the vessel or barge. A substantial update while dry-docked could potentially add 20-30 years of useful life to a vessel. In addition, our vessels and barges are predominately on “standby” and are operated at much lower utilization levels than typical vessels. The relatively low utilization rate of our vessels helps to reduce overall maintenance costs and extends the useful life and return on assets of a typical vessel.
 
Federal, state and local legislation and other environmental agencies require numerous certifications and accreditations. These certifications are often cost and time prohibitive to gain and require expensive multi-step, complex permitting processes. We have decades of experience successfully permitting and maintaining regulatory compliance. Certain of our barges have also been grandfathered into certain regulatory requirements. For example, new regulations requiring new barges to be built with double hulls do not impact our current fleet. Our specialized asset base, essential regulatory certifications and entrenched market position pose a barrier to entry for potential competitors.

Compelling Financial Model with Track Record of Consistent Revenue Growth across Economic Cycles
 
The services we provide to our customers are highly-regulated and often considered non-discretionary by our customers. The regulatory-driven demand for many of our services creates highly recurring revenue and growth opportunities. We have a demonstrated history of stability with consistent performance through economic cycles. Each of our segments are highly complementary and help to provide a more diversified revenue mix. Our Domestic Standby Services are required by OPA-90, resulting in a highly visible, recurring revenue stream that is not dependent on commodity price fluctuations. Our Domestic Environmental Services largely represent high frequency, recurring, small-ticket projects driven by overall industrial production and GDP growth, providing our revenue mix with diversity and stability. Our International Services provide our customers with global response capabilities, enabling us to diversify our economic risks across different geographies. These services support a diversified customer base across a wide geography. In addition to helping establish entrenched customer relationships, these services help to offset the overhead for maintaining an expansive facilities footprint required to support our Domestic Standby Services customers. Our Sprint segment drives significant margins through its differentiated environmental services and waste disposal capabilities. This attractive margin profile coupled with minimal capital expenditures have driven exceptional free cash flow generation. In addition, going forward, our management expects free cash flow conversion to increase as our additional waste disposal facilities become fully operational in the next few years.
End Market Diversification and Minimal Customer Concentration
 
We have a highly diversified customer base with minimal customer concentrations across a wide range of industries. We are not dependent on any one customer, any major event or incident or any specific end market for significant portions of our annual revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2018, on a combined basis, no customer represented more than 5% of total revenue and our top ten customers accounted for less than 15% of total revenue. Our customers require high-volume, smaller dollar projects across industrial, energy, marine, transportation, utility and government markets. Additionally, services provided to our customers are highly-regulated and often considered non-discretionary. We believe our diverse customer base, broad service offerings and annual retainer fees under long-term or evergreen contracts allow us to reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles and commodity price volatility. Approximately 85% of our Domestic Standby Services customers are under retainer contracts with tenure of over 5 years, and over 60% have retainer contracts spanning over 10 years.
Experienced Management Team with Deep Industry Expertise
 
Our executive officers have extensive and applicable industry experience and expertise, and are supported by a deep bench of experienced operating managers overseeing a specialized, skilled and dedicated employee base. Our executive officers have an average of over 20 years of experience in the environmental and industrial services industries. Our broader management team maintains a significant depth of functional experience in environmental and waste disposal services. Our executive officers and our management team have a long track record of achieving organic growth and a history of successfully executing and integrating acquisitions. Effective management and successful implementation of strategic initiatives have resulted in a demonstrated history of stability and resistance to commodity price volatility and economic cycles.

Knowledge of the Highly Complex EH&S Regulatory Environment
 
The industrial and commercial markets that we serve face an increasingly complex and strict regulatory environment. This is driving demand for large and comprehensive providers of environmental services with the expertise and required certifications necessary to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory environment. Federal, state and local laws and regulations require that service providers have numerous certifications and accreditations, including expensive, multi-step permitting processes that can be cost- and time-prohibitive to smaller service providers. We utilize our decades of experience and highly qualified staff to assist our customers in navigating this increasingly complex and stringent regulatory environment.
Strong Culture of Safety and Environmental Compliance
 
Our “Safety First” culture is at the core of our operations and service offerings. Our commitment to safety allows us to consistently achieve a safety record above industry standards, a key differentiator for customers and an important barrier to entry for other service providers. We have implemented a comprehensive safety and training program that supports our industry-leading safety record, including our “Plan-Do-Check-Act” methodology and emphasis on targeting zero incidents through continuous process improvement. Our employee training is covered through the Competency Assurance Management Program, and our Quality Control Program provides a roadmap for achieving operational excellence. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an experience modification rate (“EMR”) of 0.74 compared to the industry benchmark average of 1.0. EMR measures a company’s history and safety record as compared to other businesses in our industry. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) of 1.46. TRIR is a measure of the rate of recordable workplace injuries. Internationally, we maintain ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications.
Our Strategy
 
We are focused on a multi-pronged growth strategy, including near-term actionable opportunities that we believe will drive revenue growth and earnings. To that end, we seek to further enhance and differentiate our platform of essential environmental and compliance service offerings through customer and geographic expansion opportunities. The principal elements of our business strategy are to:

● | Expand our waste disposal capabilities. A key part to our business strategy is to focus new initiatives on higher-margin, high-growth waste disposal services. We are in the process of expanding our waste disposal capabilities into the Permian Basin in order to meet the growing demands of our existing waste disposal and environmental services customers. Our three new Permian Basin facilities will be strategically located to provide access to waste disposal services for the majority of drilling activity in the Permian Basin, one of the most attractive markets in North America with substantial ongoing investment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus on highly recurring, non-discretionary demand. We have a demonstrated track record of increasing contracted retainer revenue, which is highly recurring and historically predictable with exceptional customer retention and profitability, and capturing incremental tolling revenue generated by customers who require specific compliance coverage when a vessel enters an independently-regulated geography. As a market leader in the vessel standby market, we are well positioned to capitalize on increasing regulation and continued growth in vessel and tanker traffic globally. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our service offerings and geographic coverage. We plan to expand our core service offerings in response to customer demand in the face of increasing regulatory complexity. In addition, we intend to enter new geographies to provide local support to our existing customers across their global operations. In particular, the recently privatized Mexican oil and gas market represents a significant growth opportunity for our business. In addition, we have launched our new Global Emergency Response program to uniquely leverage existing assets in our Domestic Standby Services and Domestic Environmental Services segments to meet the growing demand from our customers for emergency response outsource services driven by our longstanding history in emergency response and safety record. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on cross-selling opportunities and national accounts. We believe that our comprehensive suite of environmental solutions creates unique cross-selling opportunities. We seek to leverage existing upstream and midstream oil and gas relationships to unlock profitable, new standby service contracts with key customers who do not currently use us for OPA-90 compliance coverage. Additionally, some of our legacy West Coast midstream and downstream customers have ongoing environmental service needs in Texas and the Gulf Coast that are not currently being serviced by our Sprint segment. Currently, we estimate only 5% of our customers use three or more of our services, representing an opportunity to significantly increase our wallet share of existing customers. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Industry
 
The environmental services industry, including hazardous waste disposal, is driven primarily by federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which generally regulate industrial, commercial and waste management facilities. In the United States, hazardous waste is regulated under RCRA, which created a comprehensive system governing “listed” hazardous waste from the point of generation to ultimate disposal. RCRA requires waste generators to distinguish between “hazardous” and “non-hazardous” wastes and to transport, treat, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations. Generally, entities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste must obtain a permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or from a state agency to which the EPA has delegated such authority. Additionally, OPA-90 imposes obligations on operators of tank and non-tank vessels, chemical carriers and owners of facilities, such as refineries, pipelines, E&P platforms, power plants, storage tanks and transportation terminals, and requires them to have a USCG compliant spill response plan. The United States has a long history of established environmental regulations that are expected to continue to become increasingly more stringent and complex.
 
In addition to the strict regulatory requirements driving demand for our services, the increase in operating efficiencies in energy production and the increased public visibility of energy production waste streams have provided strong industry tailwinds and position us for favorable growth.
 
Historically, the industry has been characterized by significant fragmentation, high competition and smaller local providers. The increasingly strict regulatory environment drives demand for comprehensive, large scale providers of environmental services and hazardous waste disposal with the capabilities and required certifications, licenses and memberships necessary to comply with rigorous regulatory requirements, both in the United States and internationally. In the unlikely event that federal and state regulators reduce compliance requirements, experts do not expect companies to significantly change their behavior, given potential risk to the business and uncertainty whether reduced requirements will remain under future administrations.
 
We believe the following industry trends provide attractive opportunities for growth across all of our service offerings:
 

● | strong and stable end markets;

Seasonality
 
Our Domestic Standby Services, Domestic Environmental Services and International Services segments may be affected by seasonal fluctuations due to weather and budgetary cycles influencing the timing of customers’ spending for services. Typically during the first quarter of each year there is less demand for our services due to the lower levels of activities by our customers as a result of the cold weather, particularly in Alaska, the Northeast and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in the North Sea. In addition, we could experience increased operating costs due to sub-freezing weather and high levels of snowfall.

Competition
 
The environmental services and hazardous waste management industry in which we operate is highly competitive. The sources of competition vary by locality and by type of service rendered, with competition coming from both national and regional services companies that offer competitive services to our service offerings. In Domestic Standby Services, we maintain an estimated 75% market share in the vessel standby market (based on a commissioned report by an industry expert) and also serve independent refineries, together which constitute our core standby market. Marine Spill Response Corporation, a not-for-profit USCG-classified OSRO, is the only other national OSRO provider with which we compete in the Domestic Standby Services market. In Domestic Environmental Services, the competitive landscape is extremely fragmented with a regional focus. Our major Domestic Environmental Services competitors include Clean Harbors, Stericycle, Veolia, US Ecology, Heritage, HydroChemPSC and Envirocon. In International Services, the competitive landscape includes UK-based industrial contractors and international emergency response providers. Our major International Services competitors include Bilfinger, Lanes for Drains, Adler & Allen and regional U.K. contractors. In our Sprint segment, Republic and Waste Connections are the principal waste disposal services firms with which we compete. Each of these competitors is able to provide one or more of the services we offer.
Customers
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, on a combined basis, no single customer accounted for greater than 5% of our revenue. For Domestic Standby Services, we provide services to a wide range of customers, including operators of tank and non-tank vessels, barges, petrochemical facilities, pipelines, refineries and other assets. For Domestic Environmental Services, our customers are extremely fragmented across a wide range of end markets. We perform environmental services under more than 1,200 master service agreements, completing an average of 50 projects daily. For International Services, our customers are both major international oil companies as well as UK-based drainage and construction businesses. For our Sprint segment, we provide waste disposal services to energy customers and other service providers in the energy space, with further potential for diversification as our new Permian Basin facilities begin operations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, on a combined basis, we employ 1,564 active full-time employees, of which 43 full-time equivalents in the United States are represented by labor unions. We also maintain a pool of part time employees to respond, as needed, to fluctuations in customer demand. We believe our relationships with our employees are satisfactory.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, but no single piece of intellectual property is material to our business as a whole. In addition, we have established and maintain a knowledge of leading technologies and incorporate these technologies where practicable into our services, including a proprietary technology platform that tracks location and status of specialized equipment, enabling compliance with regulatory mandated response times. Our U.S. registered trademarks include NRC, the Sprint logo, Spillsave and Op-Tech, but we also use other trademarks that have not been registered in the U.S. We also own one U.S. patent directed to an Automatic Tilting Oil Skimmer Frame. We intend to continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. We also license software and other intellectual property from various third parties. We enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with certain of our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to proprietary information.
Management of Risks
 
Our commitment to safety allows us to consistently achieve a safety record above industry standards. We follow a program of risk management policies and safety initiatives designed to reduce potential liability and manage customers’ ongoing environmental exposures. The safety initiatives include safety programs, weekly safety meetings, electronic monitoring of all vehicles and drivers, OSHA-trained representatives and PEC Safeland training for each employee as well as other required trainings. We believe our operations are conducted in a safe and prudent manner and are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Insurance, Financial Assurance and Risk Management
 
We carry a broad range of insurance coverage, including general liability, automobile liability, real and personal property, workers compensation, directors and officers liability, contractor’s pollution liability, non-owned aviation liability, hull and protection and indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, and other coverage customary to the industry. Our international operations are insured under locally placed insurance policies that are compulsory in a specific country. In addition, we have a global foreign liability policy that will provide excess and difference in condition coverage in international countries. We do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to be material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
10

 

Federal and state regulations require liability insurance coverage for all facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. RCRA, the Toxic Substances Control Act and comparable state hazardous waste regulations typically require hazardous waste handling facilities to maintain pollution liability insurance. Our liability insurance coverage meets or exceeds all federal and state regulations. Our international operations are insured under locally placed insurance policies that are compulsory in a specific country. In addition, we have a global foreign liability policy that will provide excess and difference in condition coverage in international countries.
 
Primary casualty insurance programs generally do not cover accidental environmental contamination losses. To provide insurance protection for potential claims, we maintain pollution legal liability insurance and professional environmental consultant’s liability insurance. We purchase primary property, casualty and excess liability policies through traditional third-party insurance carriers. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. However, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to uninsured losses that could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Regulation
 
While our businesses have benefited substantially from increased governmental regulation of hazardous waste transportation, storage and disposal, the environmental services industry itself is the subject of extensive and evolving regulation by federal, state, provincial and local authorities. We are required to obtain federal, state, provincial and local permits or approvals for each of their hazardous waste facilities. Such permits are difficult to obtain and, in many instances, extensive studies, tests and public hearings are required before the approvals can be issued. We have acquired all operating permits and approvals now required for the current operation of our businesses and have applied for, or are in the process of applying for, all permits and approvals needed in connection with ongoing operation and planned expansion or modifications of our operations.
 
We make a continuing effort to anticipate regulatory, political and legal developments that might affect operations but are not always able to do so. We cannot predict the extent to which any environmental legislation or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations.
 
U.S. Hazardous Waste Regulation
 
Federal Regulations.
 
The most significant federal environmental laws affecting our operations are OPA-90, RCRA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act (“CWA”).
 
OPA-90. OPA-90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. Enacted by Congress in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez tanker oil spill in Alaska, OPA-90 (1) consolidated the existing federal oil spill laws under one program, (2) expanded the existing liability provisions within the CWA and (3) established new freestanding requirements regarding marine oil spill prevention and response. Under its provisions, all U.S. tank vessels, offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities (including pipelines, refineries and terminals) are required to prepare and submit oil spill response plans to the relevant federal agency. In general, these vessels and facilities are prohibited from handling, storing and transporting oil if they do not have a plan approved by (or submitted to) the appropriate agency. The plans must provide, among other things, details of how the owner or operator of a vessel or facility would respond to a “worst case” scenario spill. While every vessel or facility is not required to have all of the personnel and equipment needed to respond to a “worst case” spill, they each must have a plan and procedures to call upon - typically through a contractual relationship with an OSRO - the necessary equipment and personnel for responding to such a spill within a prescribed timeframe.
 
In 2004, Congress amended OPA-90 to require that all vessels over 400 gross tons (not just tankers) prepare and submit a vessel response plan, as many non-tank vessels pose the same oil spill risk as small tank vessels due to the comparable volume of oil they have onboard for fuel. In 2013, regulations for non-tank vessels were further tightened, and OPA-90 compliance now requires that non-tank vessel operators contract directly with an OSRO.
 
The OSRO classification process was developed to facilitate the preparation and review of facility and vessel response plans. The OSRO classification process represents standard guidelines by which the USCG and plan developers can evaluate an OSRO’s potential to respond to and recover oil spills of various sizes. OSROs are classified based on the location of response resources and an assessment of the ability to mobilize those resources to the Captain of the Port (“COTP”) city or alternate classification city. There are equipment standards and response times specific to each operating area within a COTP zone. Customers that arrange for the services of a USCG-classified OSRO do not have to list their response resources in their response plans.
 
11

 

In addition to potential liability under the federal OPA-90, vessel owners may in some instances incur liability on an even more stringent basis under state law in the particular state where the spillage occurred.
 
RCRA. RCRA is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA has established a comprehensive “cradle-to-grave” system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous waste. States that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA have been delegated authority by the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA’s program. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit from the EPA or an authorized state agency unless a specific exemption exists and must comply with certain operating requirements (the Part B permitting process). RCRA also requires that Part B permits contain provisions for required on-site study and cleanup activities, known as “corrective action,” including detailed compliance schedules and provisions for assurance of financial responsibility.
 
CERCLA. CERCLA, also known as Superfund, generally imposes strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA, persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies.
 
The Toxic Substances Control Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) established a national program for the management of substances classified as polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”), which include waste PCBs as well as RCRA wastes contaminated with PCBs. The TSCA regulations set minimum design and operating requirements for storage, treatment and disposal of PCB wastes. Since promulgation, these regulations have been amended to enhance the management standards for TSCA-regulated operations including the decommissioning of PCB transformers and articles, detoxification of transformer oils, incineration of PCB liquids and solids, landfill disposal of PCB solids, and remediation of PCB contamination.
 
The Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act was passed by Congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants, such as vinyl chloride, and criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non-attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards. These amendments also require the EPA to promulgate regulations which (1) control emissions of 189 hazardous air pollutants, (2) create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities, (3) mandate the phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals and (4) provide for enhanced enforcement.
 
The Clean Water Act. The CWA prohibits discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities. The EPA has promulgated “pretreatment” regulations under the CWA, which establish pretreatment standards for the introduction of pollutants into publicly-owned treatment works (“POTWs”). In the course of the treatment process, our wastewater treatment facilities generate wastewater, which is discharged to POTWs pursuant to permits issued by the appropriate governmental authorities. We are required to obtain discharge permits and conduct sampling and monitoring programs.
 
Other Federal Laws. In addition to regulations specifically directed at our transportation, storage and disposal facilities, there are a number of regulations that may “pass-through” to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities. Each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste, facility or industry. Examples of this type of regulation are the National Emission Standards for Benzene Waste Operations and the National Emissions Standards for Pharmaceuticals Production. Each of our facilities addresses these regulations on a case-by-case basis determined by our ability to comply with the pass-through regulations.
 
Our transportation operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the USCG, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass.
 
Health and safety standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) are also applicable to all of our operations.
 
12

 

State, Provincial and Local Regulations.
 
There are also various state or provincial and local regulations that affect our operations. Each state and province in which we operate has laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. Some counties, parishes, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations.
 
Pursuant to the EPA’s authorization of state RCRA equivalent programs, a number of U.S. states have regulatory programs governing the operations and permitting of hazardous waste facilities. Accordingly, the hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal activities of a number of our facilities are regulated by the relevant state agencies in addition to federal EPA regulation.
 
Some states classify as hazardous certain wastes that are not regulated as such under RCRA. Accordingly, we must comply with state requirements for handling state regulated wastes, and, when necessary, obtain state licenses for treating, storing and disposing of such wastes at our facilities.
 
OPA-90 permits individual U.S. states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil or hazardous substance pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries, and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited strict liability for spills. Several coastal states, such as California, Washington, Oregon and Alaska require state-specific evidence of financial responsibility and vessel response plans.
 
Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air. Local sewer discharge and flammable storage requirements are applicable to certain of our facilities. Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land-use restrictions. We believe that each of our facilities is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of federal and state licenses which we have obtained. Once issued, such licenses have maximum fixed terms of a given number of years which differ from state to state, ranging from three to ten years. The issuing state agency may review or modify a license at any time during its term. We anticipate that once a license is issued with respect to a facility, the license will be renewed at the end of its term if the facility’s operations are in compliance with applicable requirements. However, there can be no assurance that regulations governing future licensing will remain static, or that we will be able to comply with such requirements.
 
Maritime Operations Regulations
 
We own and use in our operations 45 vessels registered under the U.S. flag, one registered under the Aruban flag and one registered under the Panamanian flag. Accordingly, we are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our U.S.-flag vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the USCG, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Maritime Administration. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the local laws of foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
 
A substantial portion of the operations of our Domestic Standby Services and Domestic Environmental Services segments is conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade. This is a protected market that is subject to U.S. cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade. These laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations, which are commonly referred to collectively as the “Jones Act.” The Jones Act restricts transportation of merchandise by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories and possessions. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act (“U.S. Citizens”), be built in and registered under the laws of the United States and manned by predominantly U.S. Citizen crews.
 
Under the citizenship provisions of the Jones Act, we would not be permitted to engage in U.S. coastwise trade if more than 25% of any class or series of our outstanding equity was owned by non-U.S. Citizens (within the meaning of the Jones Act). For a corporation engaged in the U.S. coastwise trade to be deemed a U.S. Citizen: (1) the corporation must be organized under the laws of the United States or of a state, territory or possession thereof; (2) each of the chief executive officer, by whatever title, and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a U.S. Citizen; (3) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. Citizens; (4) at least 75% of the ownership and voting power of each class or series of the shares of the capital stock of such corporation must be owned and controlled by U.S. Citizens, free from any trust or fiduciary obligations in favor of non-U.S. Citizens; and (5) there must be no contract or understanding or other means by which more than 25% of the voting power or control of such corporation may be exercised directly or indirectly by or on behalf of non-U.S. Citizens.
 
13

 

Our charter includes provisions (1) limiting the ownership of any class or series of our capital stock by non-U.S. Citizens to 24% (so as to allow a margin of safety under the statutory maximum of 25%), (2) prohibiting the transfer of shares of our capital stock if doing so would cause us to exceed the 24% non-U.S. Citizen ownership threshold (any such shares, the “Excess Shares”), (3) authorizing the redemption of Excess Shares, (4) suspending the right to vote and to receive dividends and distributions for such Excess Shares, (5) establishing procedures for the redemption of Excess Shares including providing notice and setting the redemption price, (6) authorizing us to make citizenship determinations with respect to the holders of our capital stock, (7) requiring holders (including beneficial holders) of our capital stock to submit information to establish the citizenship of such holder, and (8) generally authorizing our board of directors to take appropriate action to monitor and maintain compliance with the ownership requirements of the Jones Act.
 
All of our offshore vessels are subject to either U.S. or international safety and classification standards, and sometimes both. U.S.-flag vessels, barges and crewboats are required to undergo periodic inspections pursuant to USCG regulations. The vessels registered under the Aruban flag and Panamanian flag are subject to similar regulations and are governed by the laws of the applicable foreign jurisdictions.
 
We are in compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (“ISPS”) Code, an amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) as implemented in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those U.S.-flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the USCG pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6.
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 
We incur costs and make capital investments in order to comply with the previously discussed environmental regulations. These regulations require that we remediate contaminated sites, operate our facilities in accordance with enacted regulations, obtain required financial assurance for closure and post-closure care of our facilities should such facilities cease operations and make capital investments in order to keep our facilities in compliance with environmental regulations.
