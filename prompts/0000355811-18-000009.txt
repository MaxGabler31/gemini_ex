Item 1.        Business.

(a) | General Development of Business

Gentex Corporation (the "Company") designs and manufactures automatic-dimming rearview and non-dimming mirrors and electronics for the automotive industry, dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry, and commercial smoke alarms and signaling devices for the fire protection industry. The Company’s largest business segment involves designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing interior and exterior automatic-dimming automotive rearview mirrors that utilize proprietary electrochromic technology to dim in proportion to the amount of headlight glare from trailing vehicle headlamps. Within this business segment, the Company also designs, develops and manufactures various electronics that are value added features to the interior and exterior automotive rearview mirrors as well as interior visors, overhead consoles, and other locations in the vehicle. The Company ships its products to all of the major automotive producing regions worldwide, which it supports with numerous sales, engineering and distribution locations worldwide. 
The Company was organized as a Michigan corporation in 1974 to manufacture smoke detectors, a product line that has since evolved to include a variety of fire protection products. In 1982, the Company introduced an interior electro-mechanical automatic-dimming rearview mirror as an alternative to the manual day/night rearview mirrors for automotive applications. In 1987, the Company introduced an interior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In 1991, the Company introduced an exterior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In 1997, the Company began making volume shipments of three new exterior mirror sub-assembly products: thin glass flat, convex and aspheric. In 2005, the Company began making volume shipments of its new bezel-free exterior automatic-dimming mirror. In 2005, the Company announced, and in 2010 began delivering electrochromic dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry. In 2013, the Company acquired HomeLink®, a wireless vehicle/home communications product that enables drivers to remotely activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting, security systems, entry gates and other radio frequency convenience products for automotive applications, wherein the Company had previously been a licensee of HomeLink® and had been, since 2003, integrating HomeLink® into its interior automatic-dimming rearview mirrors. In 2015, the Company began making shipments of the Full Display Mirror®, which is an on-demand, mirror-borne LCD display that streams live, panoramic video of the vehicle's rearward view in order to improve driver rear vision. Also in 2015, the Company signed an exclusive agreement in the ordinary course of business with TransCore LLP to integrate TransCore's toll module technology into the vehicle in a first-to-market application referred to as Integrated Toll Module® or "ITM"®. The interior mirror is an optimal location for a vehicle-integrated toll transponder and it eliminates the need to affix multiple toll tags to the windshield. 
In 2017, the Company announced an agreement entered into during the ordinary course of business with VOXX to become the exclusive aftermarket distributor of the Gentex Aftermarket Full Display Mirror® ("FDM"®) in North America. The Company has also displayed a new three-camera rear vision system that streams rear video – in multiple composite views – to a rearview-mirror-integrated display. Further, the Company has announced an embedded biometric solution for vehicles that leverages iris scanning technology to create a secure environment in the vehicle. There are many use cases for authentication, which range from vehicle security to start functionality to personalization of mirrors, music, seat location and temperature, to the ability to control transactions not only for the ITM® system, but also the ride sharing car of the future. The Company believes iris recognition is among the most secure forms of biometric identification, with a false acceptance rate as low as one in 10 million, far superior to facial, voice, and other biometric systems. The Company's future plans include integrating biometric authentication with HomeLink® and HomeLink ConnectTM. The biometric system will allow HomeLink® to provide added security and convenience for multiple drivers by activating the unique home automation presets of different authorized users. The Company announced in January 2018 that it completed an exclusive licensing agreement, in the ordinary course of business, with Fingerprint to deploy its ActiveIRIS® iris-scanning biometric technology in automotive applications. 
In January 2018, the Company also announced that an agreement had been signed, in the ordinary course of business, to participate in a round of financing with Yonomi, the Company's partner in home automation technology. The Company is working with Yonomi as a home automation aggregation partner and the Company has developed an app and cloud infrastructure called HomeLink ConnectTM. HomeLink ConnectTM is an all-new home automation app that pairs with the vehicle and allows drivers to operate home automation devices from the vehicle's center console display. Drivers of HomeLink ConnectTM compatible vehicles will be able to download and configure the app to control many available home automation devices and create entire home automation settings. The Company 
also announced that Jaguar Land Rover will be the first original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") to deploy this new technology on their vehicles. 
Automotive revenues represent approximately 98% of the Company's total revenue, consisting of interior and exterior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and automotive electronics.

(1) European and Asian based automakers with automotive production plants in North America.
Revenues by major geographic area are disclosed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Historically, new safety and comfort and convenience options have entered the original equipment automotive market at relatively low rates on “top of the line” or luxury model automobiles. As the selection rates for the options on the luxury models increase, they generally become available on more models throughout the product line. The ongoing trend of domestic and foreign automakers is to offer several options as a package. The Company believes that its automatic-dimming mirrors with and without advanced features will be offered in more option packages, and continue to be available on more small and mid-size vehicle models as consumer awareness of these safety and comfort and convenience features continues to grow, and as the Company continues its efforts to make automakers aware of the Company's technology available on competitive vehicle platforms.
Automotive Rearview Mirrors and Electronics Competition. The Company continues to be the leading producer of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors in the world and currently is the dominant supplier to the automotive industry with an approximate 93% market share worldwide in 2017 and an approximate 92% market share in 2016. While the Company believes it will retain a dominant position in automatic-dimming rearview mirrors for some time, another U.S. manufacturer, Magna Mirrors, a division of Magna International Inc. ("Magna"), continues to compete for sales to domestic and foreign vehicle manufacturers and is supplying a number of domestic and foreign vehicle models with its versions of auto-dimming mirrors and may have considerably more resources available to it. As such, Magna may present a formidable competitive threat. The Company also continues to sell automatic-dimming exterior mirror sub-assemblies to Magna Mirrors. In addition, a Japanese manufacturer (Tokai Rika) is currently supplying a few vehicle models in Japan with solid-state electrochromic mirrors. There are also a small number of Chinese domestic mirror suppliers that are marketing and selling automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, in low volume, within the domestic China automotive market. The Company currently believes, however, that these Chinese domestic mirror suppliers do not at this time meet global automotive grade specifications. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to the Company's Full Display Mirror® system, and the Company acknowledges that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by third parties. 
Through the Company's HomeLink® function, the Company is the sole supplier of integrated wireless in-vehicle communication devices to the automotive industry for communication with garages, gates, parking barriers, and certain home automation products. HomeLink® business continues to be awarded to the Company either through its automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, or through HomeLink® electronic modules which are integrated into other areas of the automobile (i.e. visors, overhead consoles, and center consoles). In 2014, the Company announced HomeLink®
4

applications for alternative automobiles and vehicle types which include but are not limited to motorcycles, mopeds, snowmobiles, tractors, combines, lawn mowers, loaders, backhoes and golf carts. These product developments will utilize the market leading HomeLink® V system of communication to the home, door locks, garage doors, gates, lights, security systems, and an increasing array of home automation products. The Company announced in January 2018 the launch of HomeLink Connect™, an extension of the Company's HomeLink® feature and an all-new home automation app that pairs with the vehicle and allows drivers to operate home automation devices from the vehicle’s center console display and/or rearview mirror controls. Drivers of HomeLink Connect™ compatible vehicles will be able to download and configure the app to control a myriad of individual home automation devices, or create entire home automation settings. The Company believes it is being awarded virtually all business in this area and that while the Company believes it continues to maintain a competitive advantage in this area, the increased focus on vehicle and home connectivity through other devices represents a competitive threat to this business.
The Company believes its electrochromic automatic-dimming mirrors and mirrors with advanced electronic features offer significant performance advantages over competing products and the Company makes significant research and development investments to continue to increase and improve the performance advantages of its products.
There are numerous other companies in the world conducting research on various technologies, including electrochromics, for controlling light transmission and reflection. The Company currently believes that the electrochromic materials and manufacturing process it uses for automotive mirrors remains the most efficient and cost-effective way to produce such products. While automatic-dimming mirrors using other technologies may eliminate glare, the Company currently believes that each of these technologies have inherent cost or performance limitations as compared to the Company's technologies.
As the Company continues to expand its automatic-dimming mirror products with additional advanced electronic features and expands the capabilities of its CMOS imager technology for additional features (i.e. SmartBeam®, FDM®, driver-assist features, rear video camera, etc.), as well as continuing to expand the capabilities of the Company's CMS technology, the Company recognizes that it is competing with considerably larger and more geographically diverse electronics companies that could present a formidable competitive threat in the future as new products/features and technologies are brought to market. 
Dimmable Aircraft Windows
The Company provides variable dimmable windows for the passenger compartment on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Series of Aircraft. The Company continues to ship parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Series of Aircraft. 
Markets and Marketing. The Company markets its variable dimmable windows to aircraft manufacturers globally.
Competition. The Company’s variable dimmable aircraft windows are the first commercialized product of its kind for original equipment installation in the aircraft industry. Other manufacturers are working to develop and sell competing products utilizing other technology in the aircraft industry for aftermarket or original equipment installation.
The Company’s success with electrochromic technology provides potential opportunities for other commercial applications, which the Company expects to explore in the future when and as the Company feels it is in its best interests to do so. 
Fire Protection Products
The Company manufactures photoelectric smoke detectors and alarms, visual signaling alarms, photoelectric smoke detectors and electrochemical carbon monoxide alarms, electrochemical carbon monoxide detectors and alarms, audible and visual signaling alarms, and bells and speakers for use in fire detection systems in office buildings, hotels, and other commercial and residential establishments. 
Markets and Marketing. The Company’s fire protection products are sold directly to fire protection and security product distributors under the Company’s brand name, to electrical wholesale houses, and to original equipment manufacturers of fire protection systems under both the Company’s brand name and private labels. The Company markets its fire protection products primarily in North America, but also globally through regional sales managers and manufacturer representative organizations.
Competition. The fire protection products industry is highly competitive in terms of both the smoke detectors and signaling appliance markets. The Company estimates that it competes principally with eight manufacturers of smoke detection products for commercial use and approximately four manufacturers within the residential market, three of which produce photoelectric smoke detectors. In the signaling appliance markets, the Company estimates it competes 
5

with approximately eight manufacturers. While the Company faces significant competition in the sale of smoke detectors and signaling appliances, it believes that the introduction of new products, improvements to its existing products, its diversified product line, and the availability of special features will permit the Company to maintain its competitive position.
Trademarks and Patents
The Company owns 36 U.S. Registered Trademarks and 581 U.S. Patents, of which 29 Registered Trademarks and 534 patents relate to electrochromic technology, automotive rearview mirrors, microphones, displays, cameras, sensor technology, and/or HomeLink® products. These patents expire at various times between 2018 and 2036. The Company believes that these patents provide the Company a competitive advantage in its markets, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of the Company's products.
The Company also owns 290 foreign Registered Trademarks and 722 foreign patents, of which 272 Registered Trademarks and 705 patents relate to electrochromic technology, automotive rearview mirrors, microphones, displays, cameras, sensor technology, and/or HomeLink® products. These patents expire at various times between 2018 and 2042. The Company believes that the competitive advantage derived in the relevant foreign markets for these patents is comparable to that experienced in the U.S. market.
The Company owns 30 U.S. Patents and 8 foreign patents that relate specifically to the Company’s variable dimmable windows. The U.S. Patents expire between 2020 and 2034, while the foreign patents expire between 2021 and 2027.
The Company owns 7 U.S. Registered Trademarks, 17 U.S. Patents, 18 foreign Registered Trademarks, and 11 foreign patents that relate to the Company’s fire protection products. The US Patents expire between 2019 and 2035, while the foreign patents expire between 2020 and 2030. The Company believes that the competitive advantage provided by these patents is relatively small.
The Company also has in process 269 U.S. patent applications, 304 foreign patent applications, and 77 Trademark applications. The Company continuously seeks to improve its core technologies and apply those technologies to new and existing products. As those efforts produce patentable inventions, the Company expects to file appropriate patent applications.
In addition, the Company periodically obtains intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of the Company's business, to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.
Miscellaneous
The Company considers itself to be engaged in the manufacture and sale of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, non-automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and electronics for the automotive industry, variable dimmable windows for the aviation industry, and commercial smoke alarms and signaling devices for the fire protection industry. The Company has several important customers within the automotive industry, four of which each account for 10% or more of the Company's net sales in 2017 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, Daimler Group, and Ford Motor Company. The loss of any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The Company’s backlog of unshipped orders was $463.3 million and $459.6 million at February 1, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
