Overview
 
Using our large scale polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based manufacturing platform, we manufacture large quantities of linear DNA for various markets. Whether for supply chain security, brand protection, law enforcement or drug or biologic applications, it is our goal to help establish secure flourishing environments that foster quality, integrity and success. With secure taggants, high-resolution DNA authentication, and comprehensive reporting, our SigNature molecular tag technologies are designed to deliver what we believe to be the greatest levels of security, deterrence and legal recourse strength. Under our wholly owned subsidiary, LineaRx, Inc. (LRx), we supply DNA for use in the in vitro medical diagnostics, preclinical biotechnology and preclinical drug and biologic development and manufacturing markets. We are also engaged in preclinical and animal drug candidate development directly and with collaborators focusing on therapeutically relevant DNA constructs manufactured via our PCR-based DNA production platform.
