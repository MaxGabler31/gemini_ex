Item 1. Business
General
We are a provider of high-performance, active lidar systems technology for vehicle autonomy, advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, and robotic vision applications. With a sophisticated workforce of leaders and researchers, AEye has developed an artificial intelligence technology that enables adaptive “intelligent sensing,” differentiating AEye in the marketplace from its competition. Our proprietary software-definable 4SightTM Intelligent Sensing Platform combines solid-state active lidar, an optionally fused low-light HD camera, and integrated deterministic artificial intelligence to capture more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception of the surroundings.
AEye was founded in 2013 by Luis Dussan, AEye’s Chief Technology Officer, to create a deterministic AI-driven sensing system that performs better than the human eye and visual cortex. Mr. Dussan’s experience developing mission-critical targeting systems for fighter jets and ground troops on behalf of the U.S. military provided him with the background to develop a differentiated approach to visual sensing. While traditional sensing systems passively collect data, our active 4SightTM Intelligent Sensing Platform leverages principles from automated targeting systems and biomimicry to scan the environment, while intelligently focusing on what matters in order to enable safer, smarter, and faster decisions in complex scenarios. From its inception, AEye’s culture drew from esteemed scientists and electro-optics engineers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, the U.S. Air Force, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to create the highest performing sensing and perception system for the most challenging situations, ensuring the highest levels of safety for autonomous driving. 
As a result, our adaptive lidar is designed to enable higher levels of autonomy and functionality — SAE Levels 2 through 5 — with the goal of optimizing performance, power, and reducing cost. Our 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform is software-definable and network-optimized, and leverages deterministic artificial intelligence at the edge. We have made substantial investments in our R&D processes and deliver value to our customers through a combination of sales and direct channels. We perform the majority of our R&D activities in our 56,549 square foot corporate headquarters in Dublin, California. Our modular design facilitates product hardware updates as technologies evolve, and its small size and modest heat dissipation enable very flexible placement options on the interior or exterior of a vehicle. 4Sight also leverages a common architecture to create application-specific products across the Automotive, Mobility and Industrial markets.
Our systems-based approach encourages partnership from the well-established automotive supply chain, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. There is strong alignment between us and our partners given what is required to produce a high-performance automotive grade products at scale, including quality, reliability, and affordability. Our Tier 1 partners will add value with OEM customers through industrialization, manufacturing, integration, sales, marketing, product liability, and warranty. Our Tier 2 partners will provide automotive-grade sub-components, which are used not only in automotive lidar for ADAS use cases, but also for our products to be sold in the Industrial and Mobility markets. We expect the result will be a high-quality, high-performance product at a low cost, which we believe to be a key enabler in accelerating adoption of lidar across various markets in Automotive and beyond.
In pursuing this strategy, we have partnered with leading Tier 1 automotive suppliers including Continental, Hella, Aisin, and ZKW Group GmbH (an affiliate of LG Electronics). One of our Tier 1 partners is currently in the process of bidding for long range lidar series production awards with OEMs that are expected to represent a substantial portion of our 2026 forecasted revenues. The main markets for lidar, including Automotive, Industrial, and Mobility, are projected to see significant growth in both the near and long term. We believe this expected growth will allow AEye to achieve greater market share as well as pursue specialization opportunities like highway autonomous driving applications that benefit from our products. We expect that lidar will be a required sensing solution across many end markets, and we intend to be the leading solutions provider in these spaces. 
Market Outlook/Overview
We believe that lidar will be a required sensing solution across many end markets. We broadly define our three key end markets as Automotive, Mobility and Industrial.
Automotive
Applications for the Automotive end market include lidar sensors and software for passenger and commercial vehicles. Automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs seek to introduce lidar sensors to add ADAS features and improve safety for passengers and pedestrians. To achieve these objectives, our sensors can search, detect, acquire, and track small objects at long distances. We believe that our strategy to partner with Tier 1 automotive suppliers to produce high-quality, long-range lidar at scale will drive adoption of lidar in series production across major global OEMs.
•Passenger vehicle ADAS — highway autonomy in passenger vehicles is a highly relevant use case for our technology, as passenger vehicle OEMs are actively in the process of adding new features that enhance the consumer driving experience. These highway systems rely on consistent detection of dangerous, often small, obstacles at long distances and high speeds, which our system can optimize for in software.
•Commercial vehicle ADAS — hub-to-hub autonomy in commercial vehicles enabled by lidar promises similar technological utility to that in passenger vehicles. Importantly, however, the value that a commercial vehicle operator derives from commercial ADAS is driven by increased utility and safety through reduced risk from driver fatigue. We believe that adoption rates for long-range lidar will be higher in commercial vehicles initially due to the significant share of time that highway driving represents for commercial customers.
Mobility
We believe that lidar is a critical component of fully autonomous driving or self-driving systems. Currently, fully autonomous vehicles are primarily being tested in low speed, closed-loop (meaning a fixed route or limited geographic area) conditions. For autonomous vehicles to perform at higher speeds and unlock their full potential, we believe long-range lidar will be necessary. We may also introduce other mid- and short-range lidar systems based on the same 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform. Our system is particularly well-suited to reduce the intensive compute (and associated power and latency) requirements of fully autonomous systems because our platform handles critical data processing at the sensor level, thereby allowing the self-driving system to focus limited compute resources on the vehicle’s path planning.
We identify three distinct types of Mobility customers, each of whom stand to benefit from our best-in-class detection of small objects at long distances.
•Shuttles — moving people on-demand and along flexible routes.
•Logistics — moving goods medium and long distances in bulk quantities.
•Delivery — moving goods short and medium distances in small quantities.
Industrial
We believe there are a broad range of use cases for lidar in Industrial markets, including but not limited to rail, construction, mining & agriculture, aerospace & defense, and intelligent transportation systems.
•Rail — detecting and acquiring railway debris at long distances to stop the train to prevent derailment; assessing tracks for maintenance needs; and monitoring platform safety.
•Construction, Mining & Agriculture — detecting and acquiring obstacles, pedestrians, and animals in the path of large, autonomous construction and mining vehicles and agricultural equipment.
•Aerospace & Defense — detecting wires or other obstacles above ground for helicopters; automating logistics vehicles for the military; enabling mid-air refueling.
•Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) — intersection traffic management, tolling automation, smart mobility infrastructure, autonomous/smart parking, and work zone safety.
Commercial
Overview
We employ two different go-to-market models: one model addresses the traditional Automotive end market and the other model addresses Industrial and Mobility end markets.
We employ a channel model in the traditional Automotive market by working through Tier 1 suppliers that sell products to OEM customers. Those Tier 1 suppliers will industrialize, manufacture, and sell lidar sensor solution units to OEMs that incorporate our proprietary design and software. We expect that we will receive royalty payments from those Tier 1 suppliers for each unit they sell to their OEM customers. Royalties may take the form of a fixed amount per unit, a percentage of the average selling price of the sensor, profit-sharing, or some combination of these methods. We work alongside our Tier 1 supplier partners to quote new business according to the OEM’s specifications. Our announced Tier 1 developing supplier partner engagements include Continental, Hella, ZKW Group GmbH (an affiliate of LG Electronics) and Aisin. We are also currently engaged in partnership discussions with other Tier 1 suppliers.
For the Industrial and Mobility markets, we either sell directly to the customer or through systems integrators. Contract manufacturers with whom we have agreements, assemble, test, and deliver these products. Direct sales constitute sales of units to upgrade systems or otherwise add on to an existing product, while systems integrators will build our technology into mass produced systems, such as autonomous mining haulers, locomotives, or intelligent transportation systems.
Our lidar products employ a single product platform that is based on components sourced from an established Tier 2 automotive supply chain to drive down costs and increase reliability. We expect to utilize those same components to address the Industrial and Mobility markets, which enables us to leverage our volume in automotive, and drive costs down for the products made by our contract manufacturing partners.
Relationship with Continental
Continental, which refers to Continental AG together with its subsidiaries, is one of the largest Tier 1 automotive suppliers globally as measured by revenue. Continental is also a leading provider of ADAS products, supplying more than 25 OEMs, 50 brands, and 300 vehicle models globally, having shipped over 100 million ADAS products over the last three years, including radar, camera, autonomous driving compute units, and complementary flash lidar for short-range applications.
In October 2020, we and Continental publicly announced a strategic partnership whereby Continental will manufacture and integrate our lidar products into OEM model lines through long-term series production contracts with OEMs. Continental, after evaluating a wide range of competing solutions, entered into a Joint Development Agreement in 2021 with us setting forth the basis for a long-range lidar technology partnership.
Continental is currently engaged in multiple OEM purchasing processes using us as its technology design partner. Continental is planning a manufacturing facility with a 2024 anticipated start of production. It is expected that the full production line capacity will be contractually committed through Continental for various series production car models over the next few years.
For production lines that utilize our product design, Continental will purchase the hardware components from a group of approved automotive-grade Tier 2 suppliers manufacturing our component designs. We expect that for each unit that Continental sells based upon our licensed product design, Continental will pay us a royalty.
Products
Our product offerings are currently comprised of the 4Sight A and 4Sight M, both of which are built on the 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform. The 4Sight A is currently in early sample testing with Continental and Hella, while the 4Sight M began its transition to commercial production with automotive qualified contract manufacturers in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021.
Technology
We developed the 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform, to combine solid-state active lidar, an optionally fused low-light HD camera, and integrated deterministic artificial intelligence to capture more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception of the surroundings. The 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform enables the integration of various types of sensor inputs, including camera, lidar, and radar. Our 4Sight products are developed on this framework and incorporate both camera and lidar sensors.
The 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform leverages a bistatic architecture, allowing for physically separated transmit and receive paths. This improves range, refresh rate, and resolution over conventional coaxial architectures employed by our competitors, by allowing the transmitter to direct energy independently of the receiver’s focus. The lidar system employs time-of-flight based scanning, delivered with extremely low latency.
The laser we utilize is a 1550nm fiber laser. The 1550nm wavelength provides a photon budget far exceeding (>100x) 905nm lasers, because 1550nm is a retina-safe wavelength, therefore allowing more energy to be utilized by lidar solutions using 1550nm lasers.
We leverage custom high resonance micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS, mirrors for agile scanning over a wide field of view. The MEMS that we use are extremely small when compared to competing MEMS-based lidar solutions, and when coupled with the extremely high resonant frequency at which they can operate, our MEMS meet and exceed shock and vibration requirements for the Automotive, Industrial, and Defense markets.
The bistatic architecture that we use is key to our proprietary camera-lidar system integration. By separating the send and receive paths, we can boresight align a camera imager with the laser transmitter. While the lidar delivers deterministic 3D data, the camera is additive for interpreting human-designed contextual clues, such as the color of stop lights or the words on a road sign. The camera integration is optional, therefore, we also intend to offer lidar-only solutions to our customers.
All of the data collected is processed directly on the system-on-a-chip, where our algorithms continually evaluate the certainty of object detection in order to direct system energy and focus.
4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform
4Sight is our proprietary lidar intelligent sensing platform. This intelligence is enabled by our patented bistatic architecture, which keeps the transmit and receive channels separate, allowing 4Sight to optimize for both. As each laser pulse is transmitted, the receiver is told where and when to look for its return — enabling deterministic artificial intelligence to be introduced into the sensing process at the point the laser pulse is received. Ultimately, this establishes the 4Sight platform as active — allowing it to focus on what matters most in a vehicle’s surroundings.
The result mimics how the human visual cortex conceptually focuses on and evaluates the environment around the vehicle, driving conditions, and road hazards, enabling smarter, more accurate decision making — radically improving the probability of detection and the accuracy of classification. The sensor captures more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate and more reliable perception.
We have identified four increasingly complex levels of software which differentiate our system:
1.4Sight at Design: 4Sight at Design (software configured scan patterns) enables customers to create a single, deterministic scan pattern to deliver optimal information for any specific use case. This level is particularly beneficial for repetitive motion applications, such as power line or pipeline inspection (which cameras alone cannot achieve), or robots in a closed-loop environment that is unlikely to experience anything unexpected. Through 4Sight at Design, the customers’ unique, deterministic scan pattern will give them precisely the information they need for their repetitive pattern application.
2.Triggered 4Sight: With Triggered 4Sight, customers can create a library of deterministic, software-configurable scan patterns at design time, each one addressing a specific use case. Maps, IMU, speed, tilt, weather, and direction of the vehicle can all trigger the sensor to switch from one scan pattern to another. For example, a customer can create different scan patterns for highway, urban, and suburban driving, as well as an “exit ramp” pattern. In addition, the customer can create scan patterns for those same driving environments, but optimized for bad weather (e.g., “highway rain scan pattern” vs “highway sunlight scan pattern”).
3.Responsive 4Sight: With Responsive 4Sight, scan patterns are created at design and run time. In this level, the entire platform is completely software-configurable and situationally aware, adjusting, in real time, how it scans the scene, where to apply density and extra power, and what scan rate to employ. In this level, deterministic feedback loops or other sensors, such as camera and radar, inform the lidar to interrogate objects discretely or via dense, dynamic regions of interest, or ROIs, at various points throughout the scene. It can also dynamically alter its scan pattern on the fly. Responsive 4Sight is akin to human perception. The system is intelligent, proactively understanding and interrogating the scene, and perpetually optimizing its own scan patterns and data collection to focus on the information that matters most and responds based on firmware feedback.
4.Predictive 4Sight: Predictive 4Sight (motion forecasting) takes what is offered in Responsive 4Sight but looks ahead and, therefore, is even smarter about where (and what) it interrogates. In this level, basic perception can be distributed to the edge of the sensor network. Just like a human, Predictive 4Sight understands the motion of everything it sees, which enables the system to deliver more information with less data, focusing its energy on the most important objects in a scene while paying attention to everything else in its periphery. The end result of Predictive 4Sight is motion forecasting through neural networks. Like human intuition, Predictive 4Sight can “sense” (i.e., predict) where an object will be at different times in the future, enabling the vehicle to solve even the most challenging edge cases.
4Sight A
4Sight A is our high-performance, software-configurable lidar solution for Automotive markets. Built on a modular architecture, the 4Sight A series is easily customizable to address the specific design requirements for multiple OEMs. Industrialized, manufactured, tested, and validated by our Tier 1 partners, the 4Sight A series features industry leading, long-range ADAS performance, designed to address the need for high-performance applications. 4Sight A is built on our patented 1550nm, solid-state, active lidar. We expect that the 4Sight A will generally utilize one of the first three software levels described above: 4Sight at Design, Triggered 4Sight, or Responsive 4Sight. 
We believe the unique combination of features of 4Sight A include:
•Active lidar enables user’s choice of deterministic scan patterns catered to specific use cases and applications, such as highway autopilot;
•Feature-specific Fixed Regions of Interest (ROIs) designed to detect threats from various locations;
•Lidar perception made available through a software reference library;
•Windshield, grill, and other discreet vehicle integration options that are optimized by software configurability;
•Size, Weight, and Power (“SWaP”) optimized;
•Functional Safety (“FuSa”)/Safety of the Intended Functionality (“SOTIF” or ISO 21448) compliant for signal path — providing necessary determinism for testing and validation; and
•Lower cost than other long range lidar for ADAS applications with similar start of production date.
4Sight M
4Sight M is our high-performance, software-configurable lidar solution for the Mobility and Industrial markets. Built on our unique 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform, 4Sight M meets the diverse array of performance and functional requirements for the Mobility and Industrial markets with our industry-leading lidar performance, integrated intelligence, advanced vision capabilities, and unmatched reliability and safety. 4Sight M is a cost-effective, customizable perception solution that leverages the complete 4Sight software platform and includes a comprehensive software development kit for an extensible roadmap to autonomous functionality. 4Sight M may utilize any of the four software levels described above: 4Sight at Design, Triggered 4Sight, Responsive 4Sight or Predictive 4Sight.
Flexible sensor location within the car
Our design allows for unique flexibility with respect to sensor placement for two key reasons. First, our performance is not significantly impaired by first surfaces, such as stray light reflected off of a windshield or the plastic used in the fascia or headlight. Second, the unit’s low power requirements and small form factor makes it easier for OEM designers to integrate our sensors into a variety of locations in a vehicle, such as behind the windshield. Competing solutions, on the other hand, may need to be integrated into the roof of the car in order to resolve challenges with excess heat or size. As a result, OEMs that install competing products may need to substantially alter the physical appearance of their vehicles to accommodate those products.
Competition
Lidar-based perception solutions for autonomous applications is an emerging market with a wide variety of possible applications across many different markets. We face competition from numerous companies worldwide that are developing lidar solutions, and some of these solutions may use a similar wavelength or scanning methodology. For example, we and at least one of our major competitors both use lasers that have a 1550nm wavelength. Other competitors use MEMS-based scanning technologies that are similar to ours, although we believe our MEMS solution is unique due its small size and high resonant frequency. In addition to companies focused specifically on developing lidar solutions, we also face competition from current or potential partners and customers that may be developing lidar solutions internally. We believe that many of the other companies developing lidar solutions are focused on shorter-range sensors that passively collect data, and most of these sensors utilize 905nm lasers that limit their performance. We believe that we are differentiated from competitors by virtue of our active, embedded artificial intelligence approach that enables our lidar sensors to dynamically adapt to changing environments. In addition, we believe that our product design delivers longer range and higher resolution than many of our competitors. This is possible, in part, because we utilize 1550nm lasers that enable our lidar solutions to achieve a higher photon budget than many of our competitors that rely upon 905nm lasers. While 1550nm lasers are more costly than 905nm lasers on a per unit basis, 1550nm lasers have much higher performance and our product only requires one such laser. Some 905nm systems utilize up to 128 lasers and still don’t attain the performance results we achieve with a single 1550 nm laser. As a result, we believe that we are able to compete favorably in the lidar market, particularly in market segments such as highway autonomous driving applications that can benefit from our active, long-range, high-resolution capabilities.
We believe that our modular, patented design, our embedded artificial intelligence, which is inherently enabled by our unique product, and our strong R&D capabilities will enable us to remain a technology leader in the lidar market.
Research and Development
We have made substantial investments into our R&D efforts historically, and we expect to substantially increase our investments in this area in the future. We believe that this is essential to maintain our position as a provider of one of the most advanced lidar solutions in the market. While our R&D activities occur primarily at our headquarters in Dublin, California, we work with technology developers on a worldwide basis. Our engineers located in Dublin, California focus on developing sensor hardware, firmware, and perception software.
Our R&D team is responsible for both developing new technology, as well as enhancing the capabilities and performance of our lidar hardware, firmware, and perception software. Our R&D team also has responsibility for identifying, defining, and prototyping advanced components that we may utilize from key suppliers, as well as for our design-for-manufacturability, or DFM, and other critical capabilities. Additionally, this team works alongside our operations team to assist our Tier 1 and contract manufacturer partners as they develop large-scale manufacturing processes based on our lidar design.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our competitive advantage and our success depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect both our intellectual property and our technology. We own a portfolio of intellectual property which includes patents (issued and pending), registered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and expertise in the development of our lidar solutions.
We have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. We also rely on trade secrets, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments, components, products, and competitors in the industry.
As of March 1, 2022, we owned 40 U.S. and foreign issued patents and we had 91 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, with 8 patent applications in the drafting stage. In addition, we have two registered and five pending trademark applications. Our patents and patent applications cover a broad range of system level and component level aspects of our key technology including, among other things, bistatic lidar system architecture, laser, scanner, receiver, and perception technology.
Sales and Marketing
We utilize a combination of channel (indirect) sales and direct sales methods. In the Automotive market, we work with Tier 1 partners that are suppliers to the OEMs. We intend to license our lidar designs and other intellectual property to these Tier 1 partners, who will then industrialize and sell our technology to their OEM customers. While we intend to use Tier 1 partners as our sales channel, we also maintain direct contact with the OEMs, which better enables us to understand their specific product requirements and facilitate the implementation of our product design into their vehicles. Working with Tier 1 partners allows us to use this existing automotive value chain and provides us with an opportunity to increase our penetration of the Automotive market more rapidly than would otherwise be possible. This, in turn, will substantially reduce our investment in sales and marketing, and it will also substantially reduce the associated costs for manufacturing, working capital, validation, and testing, as well as the overhead of product liability and warranty over the life of the multiyear series production programs with OEMs. In the Industrial and Mobility markets, we use the same supply chain to manufacture through global contract manufacturers, and we will sell our products primarily through system integrator channel partners that may integrate our lidar sensor and software as part of a larger solution for an end customer. We also intend to sell directly to certain customers for situations in which a system integrator relationship is either not present or not required.
We solicit feedback directly from partners and customers in order to identify opportunities to improve our product design. Our sales and marketing team works with industry analysts, universities, and independent labs to conduct studies and performance tests, which provides third-party validation of our solutions to current and potential customers and partners. Our marketing team also drives our brand management and increases our public visibility through news releases, advertising campaigns, events, industry panels, and other public relations programs.
Government Regulation
We believe that the U.S. has provided a constructive legal environment to enable the testing and development of autonomous capabilities. We do not expect any federal rules or regulations in the near future that would impact the use or demand for our lidar technology. The states of California and New York, however, do enforce operational or registration requirements for some autonomous functions. U.S. federal regulations generally allow higher levels of safe and responsible autonomous functionality to be deployed. The European Union, China, and other foreign markets are also developing standards to define the requirements for deploying higher levels of autonomy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, is the principal legal and regulatory authority that has oversight of vehicles equipped with our sensors as they are deployed on public roadways. The obligations of motor vehicle equipment manufacturers include regular reporting under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act, or TREAD, as well as strict recall and reporting requirements for any defects related to highway safety or any non-compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Similar such reporting and recall requirements exist in foreign markets. As the development of federal, state, and foreign legal frameworks around autonomous vehicles continue to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes.
Lidar technology, such as ours, is subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.
We are also subject to import and export regulations of the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
Like all companies operating in similar industries, we are subject to environmental regulation, including water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with these rules may include permits, licenses, and inspections of our facilities and products.
Human Capital Resources
We believe that our culture is one of our competitive advantages. We have emphasized a collaborative, team-oriented, performance-based culture with a strong focus on both the development of differentiated technology and the success of our customers. Our leadership team has come from sectors including aerospace and defense, semiconductors, software, computer hardware, management consulting, and private equity. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 100 employees worldwide. The majority of our employees are in the R&D function. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our regular full-time workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in Dublin, California, where we lease 56,549 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires December 1, 2026. The Dublin facility contains engineering, R&D, operations, customer support, marketing, and administrative functions. We also lease 1,540 square feet of office space in a facility in Tiburon, California pursuant to a lease which expires on September 30, 2022. The Tiburon facility contains administrative and sales and marketing functions.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in actions, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including assertions by third parties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties, or employment-related matters. We are not currently a party to any actions, claims, suits, or other legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
