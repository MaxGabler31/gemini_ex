Our Company
Echo Global Logistics is a leading provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management solutions. We utilize a proprietary technology platform to compile and analyze data from our multi-modal network of transportation providers to satisfy the transportation and logistics needs of our clients. Our platform enables us to quickly adapt to and offer efficient and cost-effective solutions for our clients' shipping needs. We focus primarily on arranging transportation with truckload ("TL") and less than truckload ("LTL") carriers. We also offer intermodal (which involves moving a shipment by rail and truck), small parcel, domestic air, expedited and international transportation services. Our core logistics services include carrier selection, dispatch, load management and tracking.
The success of our platform and its ability to deliver a competitive value proposition to shippers (our clients) has been the main driver behind our historical growth and we believe will serve as the basis for our continued expansion. Our market share has grown within this market segment in recent years, primarily through organic growth with the addition of new customers, the expansion of relationships with existing customers, the addition of new services, and the development of a training program that enables better client service and the hiring of additional salespeople. We also have supplemented our organic growth through selective acquisitions. 
We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company in January 2005 and converted our legal form to a Delaware corporation in June 2006. In October 2009, we completed an initial public offering of our shares of common stock. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ECHO.” 
Our Clients
We procure transportation and provide logistics services for clients across a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, construction, food and beverage, consumer products and retail. Our clients fall into two categories: Transactional and Managed Transportation. 
Transactional Clients
We service Transactional clients on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Transactional clients benefit from access to our capacity, our advanced technology, service quality and competitive pricing. Our sales representatives' objective is to expand client relationships by increasing the shipper's percentage of total freight spend directed to Echo. Transactional clients benefit from access to our advanced technology, service quality and competitive pricing.
Our revenue from Transactional clients was $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. Revenue from Transactional clients as a percentage of total revenue was 78.5%, 79.2% and 81.3%, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Managed Transportation Clients
We typically enter into multi-year contracts with our Managed Transportation clients, generally with terms of one to three years, to satisfy some, or substantially all, of their transportation management needs. Each Managed Transportation client is assigned one or more dedicated account executives. In limited instances, a Managed Transportation client will request that its account executives work on-site at the client's location. 
 Dedicated account executives, together with account management and technology staff from our Solutions and Implementation teams, initiate the on-boarding process for each new Managed Transportation client. These teams review the client's existing business processes, develop a preliminary freight management plan and target a percentage cost savings achievable for the client over the life of the contract. The Implementation team then develops an implementation plan that links the client's back office processes to our proprietary technology platform.
The Managed Transportation relationship is initially predicated on a high level of personalized service, cost savings and the improved efficiency, transparency and reporting achieved through reliance on our systems. Each client's dedicated account team seeks to become more knowledgeable about the client's supply chain operations through an ongoing series of quarterly business reviews. Through this process, additional opportunities for efficiency gains, operating improvements and cost savings are identified and recommended by account managers who generally have significant industry experience. 
Managed Transportation contracts often are on an exclusive basis for a certain transportation mode or point of origin and may apply to one or more modes used by the client. These provisions help us secure, but do not guarantee, a significant portion of a Managed Transportation client's transportation spend. While the application of these contractual exclusivity provisions historically has varied, we work closely with our Managed Transportation clients to maintain our status as their exclusive provider of transportation management services for a particular mode or point of origin. 
We also provide freight bill payment and audit services, claims processing and small parcel consulting services to a limited number of Managed Transportation clients. Under these arrangements, we review the client's small parcel shipping contracts and shipment data, analyzing their volumes, distribution, rates and savings opportunities, prepare negotiation strategies and directly or indirectly participate in negotiations with carriers to improve the client's rates, charges, services and commitments.
Our revenue from Managed Transportation clients was $524.1 million in 2018, $404.3 million in 2017 and $320.3 million in 2016. Revenue from Managed Transportation clients as a percentage of total revenue was 21.5%, 20.8% and 18.7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our Proprietary Technology 
Our proprietary technology platform ("Optimizer") is fundamental to our operating system and solutions offering. We run our business on a technology platform engineered and built from the ground up and believe its proprietary nature differentiates us from our competition in a number of critical ways. All participants in each transaction (clients, carriers and Echo employees) are unified on a single platform through access portals customized to each participant's needs. We believe such integration yields critical synergies throughout our organization as well as with our clients and carriers. Equally important, internal integration ensures speed and accuracy of data capture, information exchange, shipment execution and back-end reporting capabilities. 
As our business has grown, our technology platform has continued to evolve in order to incorporate new multi-modal capabilities and integrate with new technology partners. We branded our next generation architecture (“EchoAccelerator”) to focus on driving development, automation and speed to market through all of the processes that we manage across modes. The four key areas of emphasis are: 1) quoting and pricing; 2) carrier selection, load-matching, and booking; 3) in-transit visibility, monitoring, and notifications; and 4) settlement. We believe the agility of EchoAccelerator is essential to keep pace with the changing needs of our business and offers us a critical advantage in the competitive transportation marketplace. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $18.2 million, $19.0 million and $14.6 million, respectively, on the development of Optimizer, EchoAccelerator, and related technologies. 
Each mode involves different vendors exchanging unique order and price data that must be shared with multiple parties to any given transaction. Our integration layer (“EchoConnect”) enables us to connect to thousands of shippers and carriers via Application Programming Interface ("API") and Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI"). Our technology engineers build mode-specific requirements into our system that support our ability to sell and service that particular mode on an enterprise-wide basis. 
When communicating their transportation needs to us, clients have the flexibility to do so electronically through our web portals, ("EchoShip") and ("EchoTrak"), by API/EDI integration via EchoConnect or by email/phone. Our system generates 
 4

price and carrier options for our clients based on either rates pre-negotiated with preferred carriers or historical price and capacity data stored in our system. If a client enters its own shipment through EchoShip or EchoTrak, these interfaces automatically alert the appropriate account executive. Once the carrier is selected, the client's account executive uses our system to manage all aspects of the shipping process through the life-cycle of the shipment. Our clients use Optimizer's "track and trace" tools to monitor shipment status through both EchoShip and EchoTrak.
In order to streamline communication and electronic tracking during the lifecycle of a load, we launched our carrier portal and mobile app (“EchoDrive”), which provides carriers with more flexibility, transparency and control. With EchoDrive, drivers receive fewer update phone calls, and dispatchers have a more efficient way to manage their drivers. 
We believe our web-based suite of applications connects clients with every function required to run an efficient transportation and logistics program. Transportation solutions developed for Managed Transportation clients often involve back-end systems integration, and both the solution and the specific integration requirements vary by client. Optimizer affords us the flexibility to support the supply chain needs of each client, regardless of specifications of the client's own system.
We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Some of our intellectual property rights relate to proprietary business process enhancements. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and independent contractors. Such agreements include a confidentiality undertaking by the employee or independent contractor; ensure that all new intellectual property developed in the course of our relationship with employees or independent contractors is assigned to us; and require the employee or independent contractor to cooperate with us to protect our intellectual property during and after his or her relationship with us.
Our Transportation Solutions
We satisfy the market demand for freight transportation solutions by delivering a competitive value proposition that combines advanced technology, exceptional client service, competitive pricing and highly customized transportation solutions to businesses seeking external transportation management expertise. As a non-asset based provider of technology-enabled transportation and logistics services, our solutions offerings take many forms, including multi-modal transportation brokerage and logistics services. 
Mode-Specific Offerings
For our Transactional clients, Echo offers a wide array of shipping options from which to choose:

• | Truckload. We provide TL service across all TL segments, including dry van, temperature-controlled and flatbed trucks. Our Truckload Quoting Tool technology uses our predictive pricing algorithms, industry relationships and historical lane-specific price and capacity data to quickly satisfy our clients' TL needs. 


• | Less than Truckload. We maintain relationships with, and utilize the vast majority of, LTL carriers in the market. Using our innovative RateIQ 2.0, EchoShip and EchoTrak technology, we obtain real-time price and transit time information for every LTL shipment we broker. 


• | Small Parcel. We provide small parcel services for packages of all sizes. Using our EchoPak technology, we often are able to deliver cost saving opportunities to those clients with significant small parcel freight spend. 


• | Intermodal. Intermodal transportation is the shipping of freight by multiple modes. We offer intermodal transportation services for our clients that utilize a combination of truck and rail. Our dedicated intermodal team can select the combination of truck and rail services that best satisfies each client's individual price and shipment criteria. 


• | Domestic Air and Expedited Services. We provide domestic air and expedited shipment services for our clients whose delivery requirements cannot be satisfied by traditional over-the-road service. 


• | International. For clients seeking the ease of a comprehensive international delivery option, we provide air and ocean transportation services. Dedicated account teams are able to consolidate shipments, coordinate routing, prearrange custom clearance and organize local pick-up and delivery, all in an effort to minimize the time and economic burdens associated with international shipping.

Logistics Services Offerings
Many clients, often in our Managed Transportation group, prefer a comprehensive and customized freight management solution that maximizes system-wide efficiencies as well as cost savings. In these instances, clients outsource their freight management needs to us, and we develop a plan involving a wide range of multi-modal brokerage and transportation management services that often includes the redesign and reengineering of distribution networks that connect a client to its suppliers and customers.
Transportation management and logistics services that we provide to such clients can include:

• | Rate negotiation;


• | Procurement of transportation, both contractually and in the spot market;


• | Shipment execution and tracking;


• | Carrier management, selection, reporting and compliance;


• | Executive dashboard presentations and detailed shipment reports;


• | Freight bill payment and audit;


• | Claims processing and service refund management;


• | Design and management of inbound client freight programs;


• | Individually configured web portals and self-service data warehouses;


• | Enterprise resource planning ("ERP") integration with transactional shipment data;


• | Integration of shipping applications into client e-commerce sites; and


• | Back-end reports customized to the internal reporting needs of the client's business.

Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Echo had 2,595 employees, of which 1,716 were sales representatives and agents. 
Our sales representatives and agents are located in more than 30 offices throughout the United States. Sales representatives are employees focused on identifying and growing relationships with shippers and carriers. Sales agents work independently or in station offices and generally are experienced industry sales professionals managing their own client relationships. Both sales representatives and agents are primarily responsible for managing and servicing the client and carrier relationships whose business they secure.
Candidates for employment are identified and screened through traditional means, such as career fairs, search firms, job postings, advertisements in industry publications and referrals. The majority of hires within our sales and service organization are recent college graduates. We invest extensively in their training and ongoing development to ensure their long-term success as a part of our organization. Employees who join Echo as a result of an acquisition also participate in training tailored to their needs. We are confident that our employee training and development efforts contribute to longer tenure, increased productivity and a greater commitment to client satisfaction. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
Our Carrier Network
In 2018, we continued to enhance our vast carrier network of motor, rail, air and ocean freight transportation providers. We select our carriers on the basis of their capabilities, geographic coverage, quality of service and price. Carriers selected to join our network provide physical transportation services to our clients. In our capacity as intermediary, we track our clients' shipments from origin to destination. Since we do not own any transportation equipment and do not employ those directly involved in the delivery of our clients' shipments, the nature of our carrier relationships is essential to our success. 
We believe we provide value to our carriers through our proprietary technology (EchoDrive), which gives our carriers the flexibility to simplify load management, manage drivers and review invoice status. Our carriers benefit by gaining access to our clients and our carrier communication tools, which allow us to match our clients’ freight with our carriers' excess capacity.

We maintain the quality of our carrier network by obtaining documentation from each carrier that ensures the carrier is properly licensed and insured, and satisfies our safety requirements. Additionally, we continuously monitor data from our network on capacity, price trends, reliability, quality control standards and overall client service. We believe this quality control program helps to ensure shippers are provided the highest quality service, regardless of the specific carrier selected for an individual shipment.
The carriers in our network range in size from large national trucking companies to owner-operators of single trucks. We are not dependent on any one or a limited number of carriers. Our largest carrier accounted for less than 5% of our total 2018 transportation costs.
Competition
We operate in the highly competitive and fragmented market for commercial freight transportation and third-party logistics services. Primary competitors to our services include other national non-asset based third-party logistics companies, as well as regional or niche freight brokerages, asset-based carriers offering brokerage and/or logistics services, wholesale intermodal transportation service providers and rail carriers. In addition, we may from time to time compete against carriers' internal sales forces or shippers' internal transportation departments. We also buy transportation services from, and sell services to, some of the companies with which we compete.
We believe we compete for business on the basis of service, reliability and price. Some of our competitors may have more clients, larger clients, more resources, and possibly greater expertise in a single transportation mode than we do. We compete successfully with these companies by delivering a multi-modal solution using advanced technology combined with excellent client service, competitive pricing and highly customized transportation solutions.
Our clients may choose not to outsource their transportation business to us in the future by performing formerly outsourced services for themselves, either in-house or through external partnerships or other arrangements. We believe our key advantage over clients' in-house operations is our ability to simplify the transportation process by delivering volume-based pricing and service superior to what our clients can secure independent of Echo. In short, we provide our clients the opportunity to focus on their core operations by providing our transportation buying power and expertise. 
Government Regulation
We are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a broker authorized to arrange for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. Subject to applicable federal and state regulation, we arrange for the transportation of most types of freight to and from any point in the United States. We arrange transportation for United States domestic shipments by land that are mostly governed by federal regulation, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”), which is an agency of the Department of Transportation; some shipments are also regulated by various state agencies. The FMCSA has broad regulatory powers in areas such as safety and insurance relating to interstate motor-carrier and property broker operations. The transportation industry is generally subject to possible changes in the governing law (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental or safety regulations, or limits on vehicle weight and size) that could impact the economics of the industry. 
Our international operations are impacted by a wide variety of United States regulations from various government agencies, along with foreign regulatory authorities. Regulations set by these departments may cover matters such as the type of commodities that may be shipped and how certain commodities may be shipped. These departments also issue regulations regarding unfair international trade practices and limitations on entities with which we may engage in business.
We contract with indirect air carriers who have been approved by the Transportation Security Administration (the “TSA”) and the Department of Transportation to arrange for transportation by air for our clients. The air freight industry is generally subject to regulatory and legislative changes that could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of providing, services to clients.
Our ocean transportation business in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission (the “FMC”). We are not licensed as an ocean freight forwarder or a non-vessel operating common carrier operator. However, we do engage in business with entities who are licensed in ocean transportation so that we may arrange for transportation by sea for our clients. 
Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor-carriers and property brokers, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements. Generally, we contractually require the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. Although compliance with the regulations governing 
 7

licenses in these areas has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability.
Risk Management and Insurance
If a client's shipment is damaged during the delivery process, our customer may file a claim for the damaged shipment with us, which we will pursue directly with the carrier on our client's behalf. In the cases where we have agreed (either contractually or otherwise) to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we may pay the claim to our client while we independently pursue reimbursement from the carrier. If we are unable to recover all or any portion of the claim amount from our carrier, or our carrier's insurance, we may bear the financial loss of such claim. We mitigate this risk by using our quality control program to carefully select carriers with adequate insurance, quality control procedures and safety ratings. We also take steps to ensure that the coverage we provide to our clients for damaged shipments is substantially similar to the coverage that our carriers provide.
 We require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least $1 million in automobile liability insurance and $0.1 million in cargo insurance. We also maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to protect us against cargo damages that may not be recovered from the responsible motor-carrier. We carry various liability insurance policies, including automobile and general liability. Our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of $10 million per incident.
We extend credit to certain clients as part of our business model. These clients are subject to an approval process prior to any extension of credit or increase in their current credit limit. Our accounting department reviews each credit request and considers, among other factors, payment history, current billing status, recommendations by various rating agencies and capitalization. Clients that satisfy our credit review may receive a line of credit or an increase in their existing credit amount. We believe this review and approval process helps mitigate the risk of client defaults on extensions of credit and any related bad debt expense. Additionally, the Company maintains a credit insurance policy for certain accounts.
