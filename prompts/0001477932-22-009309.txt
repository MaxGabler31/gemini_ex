ITEM 1. BUSINESSCorporate Overview 

Established in 2014, Innovation1 Biotech Inc. (OTCQB: IVBT) is headquartered in New York, NY. Innovation1 Biotech is a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and clinical development of novel synthetic analogs of botanical Schedule 1 molecules addressing major unmet medical needs. We take already validated technologies and identify opportunities to refine and reengineer them, eliminating deficiencies and creating products with more desirable performance attributes. The candidate molecules in our portfolio have their genesis in natural product botanical chemistry but have been subsequently modified via synthetic chemistry to endow them with more favorable pharmaceutical characteristics.

On November 9, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all of the assets, including intellectual property assets, relating to Mioxal®, a nutraceutical complex composed of essential amino acids, natural coenzymes and minerals, held by ST Biosciences, Ltd., a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STB”). The Acquisition was completed pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 5, 2021 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 8, 2021 (the “November 8th Current Report”). As consideration for the Acquisition, the Company issued 19,831,623 shares of Common Stock to STB, which at the closing of the Acquisition represented approximately 70% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully-diluted basis. The closing of the Acquisition contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement on November 5, 2021, resulted in a change of control of the Company.

The Common Stock issued to STB was valued at approximately $40,495,000 or $2.05 per share. 

On November 7, 2022, the Company completed the disposition of all of the intellectual property assets and associated liabilities relating to Mioxal®. See Subsequent Events. 

Our Pipeline

At Innovation1 Biotech, we are delivering innovative change in the psychedelic and cannabinoid space through the development of a portfolio that addresses five independent clinical indications with fully synthetic prodrugs, wherein the current therapeutic armamentarium is inadequate or non-existent.

• | The first agent is a novel prodrug of psilocin, a molecule naturally found in certain mushroom species that has been shown to interact with hydroxytryptamine receptors in the limbic system of the central nervous system. Preclinical and human data support its use as a long-effecting agent for reduction of clinical depression. Our prodrug allows for a smooth pharmacokinetic profile, and avoids peak toxicologic side-effects, by blunting the maximal peak concentration. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | The second agent is a novel prodrug of synthetic tetrahydrocannobivarin, a molecule naturally found in Cannabis that modulates the two principal cannabinoid receptors: CBR1 and CBR2. Preclinical data support its use in the treatment of drug addiction. Our prodrug, which is manufactured chemically without any connection to the Cannabis plant, allows for improved bioavailability and hence more stable and reliable concentrations of the drug in the central nervous system. 
• | The third agent is a novel prodrug of synthetic cannabidophorol, a molecule naturally found in Cannabis, closely related to cannabidiol (CBD), that desensitizes several membrane-bound receptors in the brain (TRPV1, TRPA1, GPR55) that impact neuronal excitability and seizures. The FDA has already approved Epidiolex (CBD) for treatment of a childhood seizure disorder (Dravet syndrome). Our prodrug, which is manufactured chemically without any connection to the Cannabis plant, is expected to have improved bioavailability in comparison to CBD and its payload, cannabidophorol, is anticipated to be more potent than CBD in suppressing seizures due to its greater affinity for its biological targets.

• | The fourth agent is a second novel prodrug of a highly selective CB2R agonist payload, synthetic HU-308, which is structurally similar to tetrahydrocannabinol but without its psychotropic properties. HU-308 prodrug is manufactured chemically, without any connection to the Cannabis plant. Preclinical data support the use of this payload in the treatment of wounds, based on its role in blocking inflammatory injury and in triggering stem cell proliferation and angiogenesis required for prompt wound closure. The Company intends to advance its HU-308 for the treatment of burn wound injury.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | The fifth agent is a second water-soluble prodrug of HU-308, formulated as an eye drop for topical ophthalmic care. Preclinical data support the use of this payload in the treatment of uveal inflammation and corneal injury, based on its role in suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and via stimulation of growth factors necessitated for repair of damaged epithelium. The Company’s prodrug allows for improved bioavailability and facile administration as an eye drop. 

Research and Clinical Development Strategy

We are currently in the pre-clinical development stage for our five pharmaceutical candidates. Our goal is to become a leader in the development of modified Schedule 1 molecules of botanical origin where there is the opportunity to effect breakthrough advances in diseases of unmet medical need. 

In order to achieve our goal, we plan to build an experienced team of senior executives and board members, along with a team of scientists accomplished in all facets of pharmaceutical research and development, drug formulation, clinical trial execution, and regulatory submissions. We intend to leverage the knowledge of our team in order to complete the clinical trials needed to receive approvals of our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities. 

Capital Considerations 

Our business plan can be adjusted based on the available capital to the business.

· | We believe cash on hand will not adequately fund our current planned operations and capital needs for the next 12 months. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities, including seeking investments from strategic investors. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.


The above reflects our current judgment and belief regarding the direction of our business. Actual events, expenditures and results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections or assumptions suggested herein.

Product Marketing

We currently have no marketing agreement(s) with third party marketing groups.

Product Development

Innovation1 Biotech has engaged with Salzman Group, a US-Israeli pharmaceutical firm that according to Salzman Group has designed and developed of novel small molecules for a number of clinical applications. According to Salzman Group, it has invented novel, proprietary, water-soluble, and fully synthetic prodrugs of the most promising botanical molecules existing today. It is the stated goal of Salzman Group to exploit the vast intrinsic therapeutic power of botanical Schedule 1 molecules. Innovation1 Biotech has acquired five proprietary preclinical prodrugs, all fully synthetic without connection to botanical sourcing: a psychedelic molecule for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, a novel cannabinoid and tree bark derived psychedelic for treatment of addiction, and three additional novel cannabinoid prodrugs addressing clinical indications of refractory pediatric epilepsy, hypertrophic scarring after burn wound injury, and ocular inflammation of the cornea and anterior uvea. 

See Subsequent Events below concerning the resignation of Dr. Salzman and his related groups, Salzman Group and Herring Creek Pharmaceuticals.

Competition

Direct Competitors:

The Company does not currently face direct competition for its portfolio technologies, but has a number of indirect competitors as listed below.

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and intense competition. While we believe that our knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates for which we complete clinical development successfully and for which we receive marketing approval may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

Many of our competitors have far greater marketing and research capabilities than us. We also face potential competition from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, among others, which may in the future develop products to treat those diseases that we currently or, in the future, seek to treat. The current market for treatments that assist in novel therapeutics for major unmet medical needs, is highly unknown. Our commercial opportunity would be reduced significantly if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our product candidates.

Indirect Competitors:

Posttraumatic stress disorder is treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medications sertraline and paroxetine, both approved by the FDA for PTSD treatment. Antianxiety medications are commonly prescribed to relieve severe anxiety despite their potential for abuse. While several studies indicated that the antihypertensive medication prazosin (Minipress) may reduce or suppress nightmares in some people with PTSD, a more recent study showed no benefit over placebo.

Addiction symptoms and signs of drug withdrawal and detox are currently managed with (1) anxiolytic agents that reduce anxiety and irritability, such as benzodiazepines, (2) antidepressants such as sertraline and fluoxetine, and (3) clonidine to reduce sweating, cramps, muscle aches, anxiety, tremors, and seizures. Alcohol addiction is treated with (1) naltrexone to block receptors in the brain that produce alcohol’s pleasurable effects, (2) acamprosate to relieve emotional and physical distress and depression, and (3) disulfiram to induce nausea and vomiting when alcohol is ingested. Heroin and opiate addiction are currently treated with methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.

Childhood epilepsy, manifesting as partial or tonic-clonic seizures, is currently treated with carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid, as well as ACTH, clobazam, felbamate, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, tiagabine hydrochloride, topiramate, vigabatrin, and zonisamide. The medications Diastat rectal gel, Epidiolex (made from cannabidiol), and fenfluramine have been approved for treatment of refractory childhood epilepsy (Dravet’s syndrome).

Uveitis is treated with (1) corticosteroids, (2) immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, cyclosporin, methotrexate, and mycophenolate, and (3) targeted immunomodulating biologic agents, including Abatacept, Adalimumab, Daclizumab, Infliximab, and Rituximab.

Wound care is currently treated with topical antibiotics and disinfectants, and supportive surgical debridement and skin grafting.

We are reliant on our domain name, www.innovation1bio.com, to market our products. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain name or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.

Subsequent to August 31, 2022, we sold the Mioxal product intellectual property and intangible assets as described in Note 12 to the financial statements and in the Subsequent Events disclosed elsewhere in this document. 

Government Regulation

Initially, we intend to obtain approvals for our pharmaceutical candidates from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, and other countries’ governmental regulatory agencies approvals for our product candidates. 

Regulation of Psilocin and Ibogaine analog 

In the United States, psychedelics, such as psilocin and ibogaine, are listed by the DEA as a Schedule I substance under the CSA. The Company is developing a prodrug of psilocin and an analog of ibogaine, entitled 18-methylaminocoronaridine, which might be considered as a Schedule I substance under the Federal Analog Act. The DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II substances are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II substances is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription and may have a black box warning. Further, most, if not all, state laws in the United States classify psilocin as a Schedule I controlled substance. For any product containing a prodrug of psilocin or an analog of ibogaine to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, these prodrugs and analogs must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. Commercial marketing in the United States will also require scheduling-related legislative or administrative action.
