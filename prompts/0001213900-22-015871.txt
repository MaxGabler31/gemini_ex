ITEM 1. BUSINESS



We are a technology innovator for lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries. We design, develop and manufacture battery systems for electric vehicles and energy storage systems that feature ultra-fast charging capabilities, long life and superior safety. Our vision is to solve the key constraints in electric vehicle development and in high-performance energy storage applications. We believe the ultra-fast charging capabilities of our battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles. We believe that the long battery life of our battery systems also reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles and energy storage applications.



We offer our customers a broad range of cell chemistries, including lithium titanate oxide (“LTO”), lithium iron phosphate (“LFP”), nickel manganese cobalt version 1 (“NMC-1”) and nickel manganese cobalt version 2 (“NMC-2”). Based on our customer’s application, we design, develop and integrate the preferred chemistry into our cell, module and pack manufacturing capabilities. Our strategic priority is to offer these battery solutions for commercial vehicles and energy storage systems. We define commercial vehicles as light, medium, heavy-duty trucks, buses, trains, mining trucks, marine and port applications, automated guided and specialty vehicles. For energy storage applications, we focus on high-performance applications such as grid management and frequency regulation.



Additionally, as a vertically integrated battery company, we design, develop and manufacture the following battery components: cathode, anode, electrolyte and separator. We also intend to market our full concentration gradient (“FCG”) cathode and polyaramid separator to passenger car original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and consumer electronics manufacturers.



Since we launched our first ultra-fast battery system in 2009, we have sold and delivered approximately 2,653.72 megawatt hours (“MWh”) of battery systems. As of December 31, 2021, we had an order backlog of approximately $114.5 million for our battery systems equivalent to approximately 444.8 MWh. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased $44.5 million, or 41.3%, to $152.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.



After initially focusing on the PRC and the Asia & Pacific regions, we have expanded and intend to continue expanding our presence and product promotion to Europe and the U.S. to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. A number of prototype projects are ongoing with regard to sports cars, commercial vehicles, trucks, port equipment and marine applications in the U.S. and Europe.



Our Solution



Our approach is offering a tailored battery solution based on the operating requirements of our customers. With a broad range of battery chemistries to select from, we can offer several different battery solutions to our customers, including LTO, LFP, NMC-1 and NMC-2. We believe our technologies and battery systems offer the following advantages over commonly used battery systems:

● | Ultra-Fast Charging Capability. Depending on the selected battery chemistry, we can offer battery solutions that can be fully charged within 10-30 minutes, significantly faster than commonly used battery systems. The ultra-fast charging capabilities of our battery systems significantly enhance electric vehicle mobility and have the potential to accelerate consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Our latest-generation LTO cells can be fully charged within 10 minutes while providing an energy density of up to 180 watt-hours per liter (“Wh/l”) and 95 watt-hours per kilogram (“Wh/kg”). These ultra-fast charging capabilities and long battery life can meet the diverse vehicle design requirements of our OEM customers. Our NMC-2 products can be fully charged within 30 minutes, providing higher energy density of more than 220Wh/kg.

● | Long Battery Life. Depending on the selected battery chemistry, we can offer battery solutions with a life of between 2,500 and 20,000 full charge/discharge cycles. The longer battery life enables our battery systems’ useful life to match the life of the vehicles in which our systems are installed, avoiding the need to replace the battery and thereby lowering our customers’ total cost of ownership. For example, our LTO batteries retain 90% of their initial capacity after approximately 10,300 full charge/discharge cycles, according to a test report produced by WMG, an academic department at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced Margin of Safety. Drawing from an intellectual property library that took over a decade to develop, we work to increase the margin of safety of our products, beginning with the initial design and through the use of carefully selected battery components. Our LTO battery is inherently safer than other battery chemistries, with very good thermal stability, the ability to operate in a broad range of temperatures, and a lower risk of internal short circuits and fire-related hazards. For products demanding higher energy densities, our in-house manufactured battery components, the aramid separator, non-flammable electrolyte and full-concentration gradient cathode individually or collectively are being implemented in certain current and future products to improve product safety. Our in-depth knowledge of how these battery components interact with each other in the battery cell is utilized in the design and build of our products, helping ensure our products have better safety margins.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategies



Our strategy is to globally market our competitive product portfolio. Initially, we intend to focus our sales and marketing efforts on our battery solutions in commercial vehicles and energy storage customers, where our vertical integration and high-performance technology can address the challenging and diverse set of requirements desired by these customers. For passenger electric vehicles and consumer electronics applications we are marketing our FCG cathode and polyaramid separator components to manufacturers that need better materials to meet demands for higher energy densities and greater intrinsic safety.



Global market presence



After initially being focused on the PRC and the Asia & Pacific regions, we have expanded and intend to continue expanding our presence and product promotion to Europe and the U.S. to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. In 2021, we increased our marketing efforts directed at potential customers in regions outside the Asia & Pacific region and added more employees to support business development efforts in the Western Hemisphere.



The Western Hemisphere presents enormous growth opportunities for electric vehicles, driven by higher emission standards, reduced total cost of ownership compared to gas-based combustion engines, and growing environmental awareness. In the U.S., we believe the current political administration is likely to push the electrification revolution through regulation. In pursuing contract opportunities with industry-leading companies in the Western Hemisphere, we have seen how our potential customers recognize the lower total cost of ownership for commercial electric vehicles and are seeking alternative forms of energy for energy storage applications.



Our growing operations in Europe and the U.S. are conducted through our subsidiaries in Germany and the U.S. Revenues generated in Europe and the U.S. are expected to be used to continue to fund operations and growth in those particular geographies.



As we expand our presence globally, we will continue to invest in our existing operations in the PRC and the Asia & Pacific region and continue our efforts to grow our business in that region as well. Revenues generated in the PRC and the Asia & Pacific region are expected to be used to continue to fund operations and growth in those particular geographies.

Improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership of our battery systems



The total cost of ownership is an important criterion for commercial electric vehicle and energy storage system customers. In order to maintain our leading position in the market, we will continue investing in research and development (“R&D”) for our high-performing battery technology and seek new innovations to further lower costs.



For battery system solutions, this means continuing to develop new battery cells and modules and improving the energy densities of our existing batteries. Our R&D team is constantly working to integrate new designs, technologies and materials into our cells to enhance performance and lower cost. We have used this approach to develop cells with various chemistries (LTO, LFP, NMC-1, NMC-2), and to provide a variety of products (LpTO, LpCO, MpCO, HnCO) with different energy densities, fast charge times and cycle life.



One important strategy we have employed historically and will continue to focus on going forward is the research emphasis on advanced materials to enhance our products. For example, in 2019, we received the R&D 100 Award for a battery incorporating our unique FCG and polyaramid components, which showcases how new materials enable higher energy density and longer cycle life products as well as improving performance and lowering total costs of ownership. Improving performance at the base components has the added advantage of making both our battery solutions and our component products more attractive.



Expand manufacturing capacity to meet growing demand



We plan to prudently expand our manufacturing capacity to capture the large and growing market opportunity for electric vehicles. Our capacity expansion will be phased in based on our ongoing assessment of medium- and long-term demand for our products. We reached an aggregate manufacturing capacity of approximately 4 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) per year as of December 31, 2021. We plan to achieve a total manufacturing capacity of 11 GWh per year by 2025 to support growing demand for our existing products. As for battery components, we plan to expand our manufacturing capacity for the polyaramid separator and FCG cathode.



In 2021, we completed a 170,000 square foot facility near Berlin, Germany, which included the installation of a fully automated battery module line and started the ramp-up phase of serial production. We are also in the process of fully equipping the facility by installing a semi-automated pack equipment line to support anticipated demand. The Berlin facility, once fully equipped, will be able to support up to 6 GWh of battery module and battery pack capacity. In light of anticipated EU regulations designed to require battery cell production to be located in Europe and “green” energy usage for battery production and the introduction of a “battery passport,” we anticipate that in the near future we will need to build additional cell manufacturing capacity in Europe to meet local demand.



In February 2021, we began converting an existing building we purchased in Clarksville, Tennessee to support up to 2 GWh of cell, module and pack capacity. The existing facility, once fully equipped, will be able to support up to 4 GWh of cell, module and pack capacity. Once completed, it is anticipated that this facility will primarily serve our customers in the U.S. In addition, we believe there is sufficient acreage at the existing Clarksville site to construct another building and further increase capacity by an additional 4 GWh, for a total of 8 GWh of future manufacturing capacity in Clarksville.



Additionally, we are in the process of adding 2 additional GWh battery cell and module capacity and 10 million square meters of separator capacity to our facility in Huzhou, China. We believe the new facility in Huzhou will support total future manufacturing capacity up to 12 GWh.



With facilities and resources in the PRC, Europe and the U.S., our manufacturing facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in each major region. Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located around the world to better address customer demand, reduce local content requirements, limit tariffs and reduce logistical expenses.

Our Solutions, Technologies and Applications



Our Solutions



We are in the business of developing and selling innovative, and industry-leading, energy storage solutions to OEM customers. In addition to designing and manufacturing the physical battery system, we offer services such as engineering and design, maintenance and support services.



The battery system is based on our proprietary LTO, LFP, NMC-1 or NCM-2 cell products. The cells are then made into battery modules, which are then assembled into a battery pack. We handle the manufacturing of the cell, module and pack and work with the OEM to customize the battery system, so it can be integrated into their vehicles. The battery pack may be air-cooled or liquid-cooled and is designed with a flexible layout to accommodate different cell numbers and multi-layering with frames. In some cases, battery management software and installation may be provided to the customer. The battery management software monitors the battery, improving the safety and thermal control, which enhances the battery system lifetime and cost-efficiency. We assemble the battery packs using standard components, making them easier to install and maintain.



As part of the customization process, we conduct feasibility testing using a prototype of a customer’s vehicle and obtain feedback from the customer to customize the battery system for the customer’s specific use. We may also install the battery systems for our customers after we deliver the battery systems to them. We may also provide maintenance services and train our customers’ staff on the use and maintenance of our products.



We currently sell our battery systems primarily to OEMs for use in commercial electric and other specialty vehicles. Our battery systems have a number of other applications, including (a) as energy storage for renewable energy generators and utility grids, (b) for frequency regulation, (c) as an uninterrupted power supply in other high-power electrical equipment and devices and (d) in passenger electric vehicles. In addition, we can sell components of our battery system, such as the FCG cathode or polyaramid separator, to other manufacturers focused on passenger electric vehicles.



Our Technologies



We have been developing battery technologies for fast charging, long life, and high safety since our founder outlined a set of research objectives in 2008. Since then, we have developed technologies spanning the battery system production through our vertically integrated approach: from basic cell materials like cathode, anode and separator, to cooling systems and software controls for the battery pack. Some of the key highlights from our technology portfolio are:
Battery Cell Materials




● | Polyaramid Separator—Our polyaramid separator, conceived and developed entirely by us, is significantly more stable under heat than traditional poly-ethylene separators. Polyaramid is similar to Kevlar, the material that is used in bullet-proof vests, and its excellent thermal properties (stable to nearly 300°C in the air) are well known, but we have developed the techniques necessary to form this material into ~10um thick, meters wide and hundreds of meters long porous separator material that is suited for Li-ion batteries. The material is currently being evaluated through the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium grant, and the project manager from one of the big three OEMs has described this technology as “the greatest breakthrough in LIB separator technology in 20 years.”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | LTO—Our LTO powder is specifically manufactured to promote high power operation, making it ideal for ultra-fast-charging applications. LTO is a safer Li-ion battery anode material because it is one of the only anode materials inherently stable against traditional Li-ion electrolytes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FCG Cathode—Our gradient cathode was licensed from Argonne National Labs in 2017. Since then we have developed significant, flexible manufacturing know-how to produce the material with minimal cost increases compared to normal NMC materials. By controlling the concentration of metals within a particle, the material’s safety can be enhanced. This is because the gradient is a designer cathode, meaning the material design can be tailored for specific end uses and cells/customers can receive a unique material product explicitly for their needs. This customization makes the technology well suited for ultra-fast charging and low-cost advanced Li-ion cells. We believe this technology is especially well suited going forward for the development of materials that greatly reduce or eliminate cobalt from the cathode.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Non-Flammable Electrolyte—Since Li-ion batteries typically use flammable organic solvents, they have the potential, under certain conditions, to catch fire. Our technology, protected through patents and trade secrets, will not catch fire even if a flame is directly brought in contact with a cup of the electrolyte formulation. Using our electrolyte greatly retards, and in some cases can stop entirely, a Li-ion cell from catching fire. Reducing the flammability of Li-ion cells is an important safety feature that we believe will become even more sought after as the market pushes towards ever higher, and hence less stable, energy density cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cell Chemistry




● | LTO—LTO is used in place of the typical graphite on the anode. LTO greatly enhances the Li-ion cell’s safety and fast charge ability, at the cost of some energy density. Our cells using LTO have exceptional lifetimes. Our cells using LTO have successfully addressed a key problem for the technology, cell gassing. By eliminating the gas generation during cycling, our cells can have exceptionally long performance lifetimes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | LFP—One of the safest cathode options, LFP is manufactured from low-cost materials making it highly affordable. Our LFP cells were developed at the behest of a Chinese OEM, and our technology was selected over one of the biggest battery companies in the world because our performance and price were superior to the competitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NMC—Applications requiring higher energy cell density today must be built using the layered metal oxide crystal structure (which includes NMC, NCA, NMCA and FCG). Our cells based on this chemistry have excellent cycle performance, which we attribute to our better understanding of the various cell materials from our vertical integration structure. By controlling the cathode and separator technologies going forward, our NMC cells will have lower prices and enhanced safety compared to many of our competitors’ products. Cells using NMC technology have been third-party evaluated by TUV and various U.S. National Labs, confirming our claims to performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Applications



Electric Buses and Other Commercial Vehicles



The ultra-fast charging capabilities of our battery systems mean that electric buses equipped with our batteries only need to charge for 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the battery chemistry. In buses, this allows a single charge for each loop or multiple loops they travel. In contrast, electric buses equipped with certain of our competitors’ technology need to charge overnight to store sufficient energy to run an entire day. Furthermore, our battery system’s life span matches the useful life of a typical bus, which avoids the need to replace the battery during the useful life of the vehicle.



The high energy density of our battery systems makes our battery systems an ideal choice for delivery vans and trucks. It reduces the charging interval and thus ensures a smooth daily operation of the commercial vehicle by equipping sufficient energy onboard. Ultra-fast charging capability enables the use of automated guided vehicles in harbors and airports and other applications where 24-hour operations are required.

Quality and Safety Control



Our batteries have passed quality and safety control testing under the QC/T 743-2006 standard by the National Coach Quality Supervision and Test Center, a non-government entity accredited to verify certain PRC government quality and safety control standards.



In September and October 2013, we were certified by Shanghai NQA Certification Co., Ltd., a third-party accreditor, to be compliant with ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/TS16949 relating to quality management systems, respectively. ISO/TS16949 is a quality management standard that is required for suppliers to the automobile industry. We have also obtained Conformitè Europëenne, European Quality Standard (“CE”) certification from SGS-CSTC (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Underwriter Laboratories, and U.S. Quality Certification (“UL”) for product safety. Each certifying institution has its own requirements for maintaining valid certifications. Each of the UL certificates and CE certificates requires our products to be certified before they can be sold in the U.S. and the EU, respectively.



We have obtained the UN38.3 safety certification for Li-ion batteries that allows our batteries to be transported by air.



The Testing Center of MPS is accredited in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories (CNAS-CL01 Accreditation Criteria for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories) for the competence to undertake the services we provide.



Manufacturing Capacity



We measure our manufacturing capacity in MWh, which represents the energy capacity of all batteries produced for a single complete discharge, rather than the number of batteries we produce per year.



As of December 31, 2021, we had an annual manufacturing capacity of approximately 3 GWh cell, module and pack capacity, 600 tons per year of cathode capacity, 3,000 tons of electrolyte capacity and 5 million square meters for a separator pilot line in Huzhou, China.



In 2021, we completed the construction of a module and pack manufacturing facility near Berlin, Germany and started the ramp-up phase of serial production in the fourth quarter of 2021. In the U.S., we purchased an existing building that is being modified to initially support up to 2 GWh cell, module and pack manufacturing capacity.



Additionally, are in the process of adding two additional GWh battery cell and module capacity and 10 million square meters of separator capacity to our facility in Huzhou, China. We are planning to increase our total battery manufacturing capacity to approximately 11 GWh per year by 2025.



Patents and Other Intellectual Property



We have devoted more than 14 years to R&D and our intellectual property portfolio. We possess patents, licenses and/or know-how covering the following proprietary technologies:




● | Separators—We have developed a high-thermal separator, made of polyaramid polymer with a melting point of above 300°C, which we believe will improve the safety of our batteries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FCG Cathode—In 2017, we licensed the FCG Cathode process from Argonne National Labs. The FCG cathode is distinguished by its unique manufacture, where a clear and gradual gradient in the transition metal content can be observed during the analysis of a cathode particle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electrolytes—We have developed a high/low-temperature electrolyte that is stable at high temperatures (approximately 70°C) and can release approximately 70% of the energy at extremely cold temperatures (approximately -30°C) at a charge rate of 1C.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






6








● | LTO powder—Our proprietary LTO powder used for our electrodes compacts densely, leading to higher volumetric density while sustaining the ultra-fast charging properties of our batteries. It also allows our batteries to operate with less resistance by preventing the formation and/or degradation of solid-electrolyte interphase (a barrier formed between the electrolyte solution and electrode when the battery is charged) and limits the formation of dendrites. Dendrites reduce performance and increase the risk of short circuits and fire-related hazards. More importantly, our proprietary powder causes negligible volume expansion when the battery is charged and discharged. This provides our batteries with stability during recharges and extends the life of the battery.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Carbon, silicon—We are experimenting with and have developed various types of anode materials. For example, we have developed porous carbon-based anode materials which allow for a higher charging rate. The porous structure allows for faster transport of Li-ions, contributing to the fast charging properties of our batteries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our designs and technology. Our policy is to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, in addition to filing patent applications in various jurisdictions related to our proprietary technology, relying on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. To protect our rights in these areas, it is our policy to require certain of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. However, such confidentiality agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. While we have attempted to protect the unpatented proprietary technology that we develop or acquire, and will continue to protect future proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secrets, we believe that our success will depend, to a large extent, upon continued innovation and technological expertise. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”



We use trademarks on some of our batteries and believe that having distinctive trademarks is an important factor in marketing our batteries. We have registered in the PRC, the U.S. and internationally our Microvast mark (including the Microvast logo) and our other trademarks, including the LpTO, LpCO and Clean City Transit marks.



Research and Development



Our research, development and engineering efforts are focused on developing new battery solutions and continuously improving the performance of existing battery systems. We design our battery systems by targeting specific performance metrics such as energy density, power density and specific power, charge rate capability, cycle life, through-put energy and various safety and abuse-tolerance metrics.



Our R&D team is led by our Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Wenjuan Mattis. Dr. Mattis has over 11 years of experience in the Li-ion battery business and has 22 papers and 88 patent applications and patents. Overseen by Dr. Mattis, our technology center is responsible for material development, cell development, pack development, FCG manufacture, aramid separator manufacture, future technology development, testing simulation and analytical, and intellectual property. 



Our R&D efforts are focused on the following areas:




● | improving the energy density, power, life and safety through developing key battery materials:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | high energy cell and IT components;
--+------------------------------------


● | battery cell safety;
--+---------------------

● | new cell applications development;
--+-----------------------------------


● | process development and scale-up;
--+----------------------------------


● | improving electrical, mechanical and thermal designs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | improving battery systems-level designs.
--+-----------------------------------------




We believe that our ability to deliver higher performance batteries and battery systems depends upon the rapid and effective transfer of the technology developed in our R&D laboratories into our high-volume manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we maintain pilot plant facilities and reserve a portion of our manufacturing capacity for structured experiments related to manufacturing process development.



In December 2006, we established a research center, which covers approximately 75,000 square feet, in our Huzhou manufacturing facilities. The center is equipped with a full range of scientific equipment for a material science research center, including an X-ray powder diffraction machine, scanning electron microscope, gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer cape, laser particle size analyzers, electrochemical comprehensive test analyzers and other scientific equipment. In September 2016, we also set up a research center in Orlando, Florida to work on longer-term technology development. In October 2021, we expanded our presence in the greater Orlando area with the purchase of a 75,000 square foot facility, which will be dedicated to research and development efforts.



Our R&D expenses totaled $26.0 million, $16.6 million and $34.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.



Sales and Marketing



We market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales force consisting of individuals who generally have experience selling battery systems or other relevant experience into the specific market segments to which they are assigned. Our sales force is divided into three regional divisions: Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), North America, and the Asia & Pacific region. Each region is supervised by a regional leader who is responsible for developing and delivering a sales forecast.



With a focus on commercial vehicles, we engage electric vehicle and drive train manufacturers directly to educate and inform them about the benefits of our technology and products. We also promote our product portfolio to energy storage customers made up of integrators and utility companies.



For battery components, our product promotion starts with R&D engineers for passenger car OEMs and consumer electronics manufacturers. We may send certain customers samples of materials and/or prototypes for evaluation to support the sale of the component.



Our sales cycles vary by market segment, but typically follow a lengthy development and qualification period prior to commercial manufacturing. We expect that the total time from customer introduction to commercial manufacture will range from two to four years depending on the specific solution and market segment. For example, total time in the transportation market includes a customer’s preliminary technology review, which generally ranges from three to nine months followed by test and evaluation, which generally ranges from 12 to 18 months.



We focus our marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating the advantages of our solutions and generating qualified leads for our sales force. We rely on a variety of marketing platforms, including participation in industry conferences and trade shows, to share our technologies with customers, as well as public relations, industry research and our collaborative relationships with our strategic investors and business partners.

Materials



All Li-ion batteries are composed of an anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator.




● | Anode — Our anode is selected historically from LTO or graphite in our product cells. In the coming years, we anticipate that we will develop and market a new product that contains silicon or silicon oxide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cathode — Our LFP is sourced from a commercial supplier. For NMC, our existing products are made using commercially supplied material, and our future cell products will utilize FCG when possible. For NMC based cathodes the sourcing and availability of cobalt is a key issue for many OEM buyers. As such, we are actively engaged in research to greatly reduce or eliminate the use of cobalt from our material stream.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electrolyte — Our present Li-ion cells use liquid-based electrolyte formulations. For carbonate-based electrolytes we typically elect to buy the base solvents from commercial suppliers due to lower costs from their economies of scale, and then blend solutions in-house to ensure our proprietary mixtures are not shared outside the company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Separator — The separator is another key material in our Li-ion cells. While we have in the past used the industry norm PE/PP materials, we are now working to integrate as many cells as possible with our proprietary polyaramid technology. In addition, we are actively working to build on our polyaramid knowledge to develop a solid electrolyte battery system that incorporates the polyaramid material as a component of the solid electrolytes. If the solid electrolyte approach is successful, not only will it eliminate the use of liquid electrolytes, but it will also potentially enable new anode chemistries such as lithium metal, which is needed to reach cells with over 1,000 Wh/L energy densities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppliers and Supply Arrangements 



We currently purchase certain key raw materials for our electrodes and a variety of other components from third parties, some of which we only source from one supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. We are in the process of developing longer-term contracts with suppliers of raw materials and components. Despite this effort, our current suppliers may be unable to satisfy our future requirements on a timely basis. Moreover, the price of purchased raw materials, components and assembled batteries could fluctuate significantly due to circumstances beyond our control such as PVDF, lithium salts, and carbonates. “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We currently purchase certain key raw materials and components from third parties, some of which we only source from one supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.”



Customers



We work under various arrangements with major global electric vehicle manufacturers to develop batteries and battery systems for the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, battery electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle markets.



Due to the long sales cycle of our solutions and the relatively small customer base, we experience significant customer concentration. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top five customers contributed 37.3% of our revenue. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We have a limited customer base and depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues to date and this dependence is likely to continue.”



As of December 31, 2021, we had an order backlog for our battery systems of approximately $114.5 million, equivalent to approximately 444.8 MWh. We expect to fulfill most of our backlog within 2022.



We enter into contracts with customers for the sale of our battery systems. These contracts are typically in the form of purchase orders for a fixed quantity of batteries and include terms and conditions relating to payment and termination that we believe are customary and standard in our industry. We also enter into long-term supply agreements with certain customers. We are capable of providing and may offer to our customers various other services, such as engineering and design, maintenance and support. We also provide warranties for our batteries that are consistent with international market standards.

Human Capital



As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,359 full-time employees and 794 independent contractors. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages as a result of labor disputes, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business include attracting, developing and retaining top talent while integrating diversity, equity and inclusion principles and practices. Our results-oriented culture is committed to developing and delivering differentiated solutions at a faster rate than our competitors. We have built a team comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills and perspectives to produce better ideas and provide greater success in meeting the needs of our customers.



We offer benefits packages for full-time employees; our employees have opportunities to earn annual bonuses and eligible employees have the opportunity to participate in our equity-based compensation program. We believe our compensation program allows us to attract and retain talented employees willing to grow with us.



We emphasize the importance of safety to all of our employees that work in our manufacturing and research facilities. Our safety performance and training results are measured and reported weekly. The foundation of our safety programs are based on global health and safety standards. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are following local authority guidelines in all locations to ensure the safety of both employees and our customers.



Competition



Competition in the battery industry is intense and rapidly evolving. Our markets are subject to changing technology trends, shifting customer needs and expectations and frequent introduction of new technologies. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets are:

● | product performance, reliability and safety;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | integrated solutions;
--+----------------------


● | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


● | regional and industrial regulations;
--+-------------------------------------


● | pricing;
--+---------


● | new technologies/chemistries; and
--+----------------------------------


● | manufacturing capabilities.
--+----------------------------




The global battery market is highly competitive. Our competitors include many large, established, high volume battery manufacturers as well as new companies focused on the development of one or more battery technologies. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We mainly manufacture and market lithium-based battery systems. If a viable substitute product or chemistry to lithium-based battery systems emerges and gains market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, our failure to keep up with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards within the lithium-based battery market may cause our products to become uncompetitive and less marketable, resulting in loss of market share to our competitors.”

Adherence to ESG Principles



We believe that how we manage our impact on the environment and climate change; how we manage our relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where we operate; and the accountability of our leadership to our stockholders are critically important to our business. As a company whose business success is driven by our highly skilled workforce, we are especially committed to supporting our employees and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion that makes our employees feel safe, empowered and engaged.



Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance



Environmental Matters — Our PRC facility



As we conduct our manufacturing activities in the PRC, we are subject to the requirements of PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, wastewater discharge, solid waste and noise and the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution, the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the PRC, and the administration Regulations on the Environmental Protection of Construction Project. We believe we are in compliance with these environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects. We have built environmental treatment facilities concurrently with the construction of our manufacturing facilities, where the waste air, wastewater and waste solids we generate can be treated in accordance with the relevant requirements. We have outsourced the disposal of hazardous solid waste we generate to a third-party contractor in accordance with the relevant PRC laws. We believe we have maintained pollutant emission levels at each of our facilities in material compliance with levels prescribed by the relevant governmental authorities.
Environmental Matters — Our European Production Facility



Operations at our German facility are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials. To conduct our operations, we will obtain the Quality Management Standards IATF 16949:2016 and ISO 9001:2015 followed by ISO 14001:2015 — Environmental Quality Management Standard and ISO 50001:2011 — Energy Management by the fourth quarter of 2023. For safer working conditions we will also implement ISO 45001-2018 by the fourth quarter of 2023 — Occupational Health and Safety and all our machines and production lines are delivered with CE label according to the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC.



In transit, Li-ion batteries are subject to rules governing the transportation of “dangerous goods.” We only use such carriers that meet these requirements. We have policies and programs in place to help assure compliance with our obligations (for example, machine guarding, laser welding, hazardous material management and transportation). Furthermore, in order to obtain the existing building permits, we are obligated to perform environmental compliance and fire protection concept requirements under German regulations. All these standards and certificates are designed to comply with applicable government regulations and laws, as well as the standards of the automotive industry.



We train our employees and conduct internal audits of our operations to assess our fulfillment of these policies. As demonstrated in our pilot project for “Sustainable Battery Production” with TÜV SÜD Germany, the environment is very important for us.



Environmental Matters — Our U.S. Production Facility



Operations at our US facilities are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing the generation, handling, storage, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials. We intend to comply with applicable regulations and conduct ongoing training for our employees to ensure safety and compliance.

We are not currently subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as a defendant for violation of any environmental law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us relating to any environmental law or regulation that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — Compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive, and our failure to comply with these regulations may result in monetary damages or fines, adverse publicity and a material adverse effect on its business.”



Workers’ Health and Production Safety Compliance 



We are subject to the requirements of PRC laws and regulations on the health of our employees and production safety in the PRC. The major workers’ health and production safety regulations applicable to us include the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Occupational Diseases and the PRC Law on Safety Production and the Regulation on the Safety Management of Hazardous Chemicals.

See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We may fail to comply with certain health and production safety laws and regulations governing hazardous materials.”



Seasonality 



We have historically experienced higher sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to our first and second fiscal quarters. However, our limited operational history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors and the shareholders of Microvast Holdings, Inc.



Opinion on the Financial Statements



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microvast Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders’ (deficit)/equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in Schedule I (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion



These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.



We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.



Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Basis of presentation 



The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).



Basis of consolidation



The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.


Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests



For the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, noncontrolling interests are recognized to reflect the portion of their equity that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company as the controlling shareholder. Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate line item in the equity section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and have been separately disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss to distinguish the interests from that of the Company.


Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the Company for cash or other assets are classified outside of permanent equity at redemption value as redeemable noncontrolling interests. If the redemption event is probable to occur, the Company records the redeemable noncontrolling interests at the redemption value on each balance sheet date with the changes recognized as an adjustment to equity.


Use of estimates



The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group’s financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for obsolete inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, product warranties, fair value measurement of Bridge Notes, fair value measurement of warrant liability and share based compensation.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued



Emerging Growth Company



Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by FASB or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. The Company intends to take advantage of the exemption for complying with new or revised accounting standards within the same time periods as private companies. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information provided by other public companies.


The Company also intends to take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements of emerging growth companies pursuant to the JOBS Act so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.


Cash and cash equivalents



Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, or which have maturities of three months or less.


Restricted cash



Restricted cash represents deposits made to banks to secure bank acceptance notes (or Notes Payable) and letter of credit issued by the Group. It’s common in PRC that the banks require the Group to pledge notes received from its customers, up to 111%, or make a deposit for up to 100% of the face amount of the bank acceptance notes the Group issued as collateral. The deposits and the matured bank acceptance notes from its customers are recorded as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets.


Accounts receivable



Accounts receivable represents those receivables derived in the ordinary course of business, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The Group maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on accounts receivable. Management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific accounts: creditworthiness of customers, aging of the receivables, past transaction history with customers and their current financial condition, changes in customer payment terms, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in the industries the Group operates.


Notes receivable and payable



The Group accepts bank acceptance notes (“notes”) from customers in the PRC in the normal course of business. The Group may present these notes with banks in the PRC for cash payment or endorse these notes to its suppliers to settle its accounts payable. When the notes are endorsed by the Company, the Company is jointly liable with other endorsers in the note. Notes that have been presented with banks or endorsed to suppliers are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets when the notes are settled with banks or the obligations as endorser are discharged. Notes receivable and payable are typically non-interest bearing and have maturities of one year or less.


As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the balance of notes receivable were $20,839 and $11,144, respectively while certain notes receivable was pledged in the bank to secure the issuance of the bank acceptance notes by the Group.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued



Short-term investments



The Group’s short-term held-to-maturity investments are classified based on their contractual maturity dates which are less than one year and are recorded at their amortized costs. The Company recognized $366, $37 and $ nil interest income from the short-term investments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.


The Group reviews its held-to-maturity investments for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) based on the specific identification method. The Group considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment of its short-term investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds the investment’s fair value, the Group considers, among other factors, general market conditions, expected future performance of the instruments, the duration and the extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than the cost, and the Group’s intent and ability to hold the investments. OTTI is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations.


Inventories, net



Inventories of the Group consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory costs include expenses that are directly or indirectly incurred in the acquisition, including shipping and handling costs charged to the Group by suppliers, and production of manufactured product for sale. Such as the cost of materials and supplies used in production, direct labor costs and allocated overhead costs are all included in the inventory costs. The allocated overhead cost includes the depreciation, insurance, employee benefits, and indirect labor. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Inventories are written down to net realizable value taking into consideration of estimates of future demand, technology developments, market conditions and reasonably predicative costs of completion or disposal.


Prepaid expenses and other current assets



Prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily consist of advances to suppliers, prepaid expenses, deposits and value-added tax receivables.


Property, plant and equipment, net



Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:



Buildings | 20 years 
----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------
Machineries and equipment | 10 years 
Fixtures and electronic equipment | 4 - 5 years 
Motor vehicles | 5 years 
Leasehold improvements | Shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives




Construction in progress represents manufacturing facilities and equipment under construction, and is stated at cost. The capitalization of these costs is ceased when construction in progress is transferred to property, plant and equipment and substantially ready for its intended use. No depreciation is recorded for construction in progress. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expenses as incurred.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued



Land use rights, net



Land use rights are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, which are generally 50 years and represent the shorter of the estimated usage periods or the terms of the land use rights agreements.


Acquired intangible assets, net



Acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives.


Impairment of long-lived assets



The Company reviews long-lived assets with finite lives, including identifiable intangible assets with determinable useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is estimated based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows. The evaluation of asset impairment requires the Group to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Group recognized impairment losses of $2,908, $567 and $2,443 related to long-lived assets, respectively.

Fair value of financial instrument



Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, other receivable, amount due from/to related parties, accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings, notes payable, bonds payable, Bridge Notes, product warranty and warrant liability. The Group carries its accounts receivable, notes receivable, other receivable, amount due from/to related parties, accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings, notes payable, product warranty and bonds payable at amortized cost. The carrying values of other current financial instruments approximate their fair values reported in the consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term maturity.


Fair value



Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.


Authoritative literature provides a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as follows:


Level 1



Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


Level 2



Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.Level 3



Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.F-17

Revenue recognition



Nature of Goods and Services



The Group’s revenue consists primarily of sales of lithium batteries. The obligation of the Group is providing the electronic power products. Revenue is recognized at the point of time when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.


Contract balances



Contract balances include accounts receivable and advances from customers. Accounts receivable represent cash not received from customers and are recorded when the rights to consideration is unconditional. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent to the accounts receivable balance. Contract liabilities, recorded in advance from customers in the consolidated balance sheet, represent payment received in advance or payment received related to a material right provided to a customer to acquire additional goods or services at a discount in a future period. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Group recognized $556, $582 and $1,455 of revenue previously included in advance from customers as of January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021, respectively, which consist of payments received in advance related to its sales of lithium batteries.


Value added taxes



Value added tax (“VAT”) on sales was calculated at 16% and changed to 13% since April 1, 2019 on revenue from products and 6% on services. The Group reports revenue net of VAT. Entities in PRC that are VAT general tax payers are allowed to offset qualified VAT paid against their output VAT liabilities.


Cost of revenues



Cost of revenues primarily consists of the cost of the products ultimately sold to customers, shipping and handling costs charged to the Group in the sales, the direct labor costs, product warranty expense, provision for obsolete inventories and other related cost that are directly attributable to the production of products.


Product Warranty



The Group provides product warranties, which entail repair or replacement of non-conforming items, in conjunction with sales of products. Estimated costs related to warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects management’s best estimates of its product warranties based on historical information and other currently available evidence.


The Group’s product warranties generally range from one to eight years. The Group establishes a reserve for the estimated cost of the product warranty at the time revenue is recognized. The portion of the warranties is expected to incur within the next 12 months is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, while the remaining is recorded in other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Product Warranty are recorded as a cost of revenues.

Research and development expenses



Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel, materials, office rental expense, general expenses and depreciation expenses associated with research and development activities.


Subsidy income



Government subsidies represent government grants received from local government authorities.


Government subsidies related to the investment in production facilities initially records as other current or other non-current liabilities and amortized on a straight-line basis to offset the cost of revenues over the lives of relevant production assets or amortized on an effective interest method over the term of the loan. 


The Group amortized the deferred subsidy at $2,304, $166 and $269 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the carrying amount of the current portion of the deferred subsidy income was $215 and $324, and the non-current portion was $1,221 and $2,286, respectively. 


Income taxes



Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. Deferred income taxes are recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.


The Group accounts for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions when the Group believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.


Share-based compensation



Share-based payment transactions with employees are measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, with a corresponding impact reflected in additional paid-in capital.


For share-based awards granted with performance condition, the compensation cost is recognized when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at the end of each reporting date and records a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any changes to its assessment. For performance-based awards with a market condition, such as awards based on total shareholder return (“TSR”), compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period of the award, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.


Liability-classified awards are remeasured at their fair-value-based measurement as of each reporting date until settlement.

Warrant Liability 



The Company accounts for warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 under which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as liabilities. As the Private Warrants (as defined below Note 15) meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Company classifies the Private Warrants as liabilities. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the statements of operations. The Private Warrants are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the basis of the quoted market price of the Company’s publicly-traded warrants.


Comprehensive loss



Comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.


Net loss per share



Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to Common Stock, considering the accretions to redemption value of the preferred shares, by the weighted average number of Common Stock outstanding during the year using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, any net loss is allocated between Common Stock and other participating securities based on their participating rights. Net loss is not allocated to participating securities when the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to share losses.


The Company’s preferred shares are participating securities as they participate in undistributed earnings on an as-if-converted basis. The preferred shares have no contractual obligation to fund or otherwise absorb the Company’s losses. Accordingly, any undistributed net loss is allocated on a pro rata basis to the Common Stock and preferred shares; whereas any undistributed net loss is allocated to ordinary shares only.


Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to Common Stock, as adjusted for the accretion and allocation of net loss related to the preferred shares, if any, by the weighted average number of Common Stock and dilutive Common equivalent stock outstanding during the period. Common equivalent stock consist of shares issuable upon the conversion of the preferred shares and convertible bonds using the if-converted method, and Common Stock issuable upon the vesting of non-vested shares or exercise of outstanding share option (using the treasury stock method). Common equivalent stock are calculated based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. Common equivalent stock are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.

Foreign currencies



The functional currency of the Company and MP Solutions is the United States dollar (“U.S. dollar”). For the Company’s subsidiaries located in the PRC, the functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”); the Company’s UK subsidiary, MP UK, the functional currency is the Great British Pound (“Pound”); the Company’s Germany subsidiary, MV GmbH, the functional currency is the Euro, and the Company’s Singapore subsidiary, MV Singapore, the functional currency is the Singapore Dollar (“SGD”).


In preparing the consolidated financial statements of each individual group subsidiary, transactions in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are converted into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.


Exchange differences on the monetary items are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they arise.


For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the reporting currency of the Group (i.e. US$) at the prevailing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a component of other comprehensive loss.


Foreign currency risk



RMB is not a freely convertible currency. The State Administration for Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the People’s Bank of China, controls the conversion of RMB into other currencies. The value of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of the Group included aggregate amounts of $35,194 and $102,782 as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, which were denominated in RMB.

Concentration of credit risk



Financial instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and short-term investments. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings and quality. The Group conducts credit evaluations of customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers.


The following table summarizes net revenues from customers that accounted for 10% or more of the Group’s net revenues for 2019, 2020 and 2021:



 | December 31, 2019 | | | December 31, 2020 | | December 31, 2021 
------------------------------------------------+--------------------+----+---+--------------------+---+-------------------
Percentage of revenue contributed by Customer A | | 11 | % | | - | | - | 
Percentage of revenue contributed by Customer B | | - | | | - | | 11 | %

--------------------------------------------------+--------------------+----+---+-------------------
Percentage of accounts receivable from Customer C | | 10 | % | | 18 | %

Supplier Concentration



The Group relies on third parties for the supply of raw materials. In instances where these parties fail to perform their obligations, the Group may find alternative suppliers in the open market. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, 17%, 12% and 12% of its raw materials were purchased through company D, respectively, but numerous alternate sources of supply are readily available on comparable terms.


Newly adopted accounting pronouncements



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that a company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services. To achieve this principle, a company must apply five steps including identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) the company satisfies the performance obligations. Additional quantitative and qualitative disclosure to enhance the understanding about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows is also required. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 for non-public companies, and for interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Group adopted ASU 2014-09 and all related ASUs beginning January 1, 2019 and recorded $1,565 adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative impact upon adoption of Topic 606.

Newly adopted accounting pronouncements - continued



In January 2016, the FASB issued a new pronouncement ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 was further amended in February 2018 by ASU 2018-03, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. ASU 2016-01 and ASU 2018-03 are effective for non-public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Adoption of the amendment must be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, except for amendments related to equity instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values which should be applied prospectively. The Group adopted this ASU beginning January 1, 2019 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations.


In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This update addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. For non-public entity, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Group adopted this ASU beginning January 1, 2019 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position or results of operations.


In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18: Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The amendments in this Update require that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this Update are effective for non-public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Group adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 and applied a retrospective transition method on its consolidated statements of cash flows.


In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Disclosure Framework — Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement to ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”). ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, and/or adding certain disclosures. For non-public business entities, the ASU’s amendments are effective for annual and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Group adopted this ASU beginning January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued



Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases with the main difference being that operating leases are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. Non-public business entities should apply the amendments to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application of the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. In July 2018, ASU 2016-02 was updated with ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842, which provides entities with relief from the costs of implementing certain aspects of the new leasing standard. Specifically, under the amendments in ASU 2018-11, (1) entities may elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when transitioning to ASC 842 and (2) lessors may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components when certain conditions are met. Before ASU 2018-11 was issued, transition to the new lease standard required application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the consolidated financial statements. In November 2019 and June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 and ASU 2020-05 to defer the effective date. Therefore, Leases (Topic 842) is effective for private entities to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Group adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2022. The Group does not expect any material impact on net assets and the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss and cash flows as a result of adopting the new standard.


In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements. This ASU requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This ASU affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For non-public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). The Group adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2022, and does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

As of the Closing Date and following the completion of the Merger, the ownership interests of the Company’s stockholders were as follows:

----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | Includes 1,687,500 shares that may be subject to cancellation in accordance with the amended escrow agreement.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization under U.S. GAAP. This determination is primarily based on (1) Microvast, Inc.’s stockholders comprising a relative majority of the voting power of the Company and having the ability to nominate the members of the Board, (2) Microvast, Inc.’s operations prior to the acquisition comprising the only ongoing operations of the Company, and (3) Microvast, Inc.’s senior management comprising a majority of the senior management of the Company. Under this method of accounting, Tuscan is treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Microvast, Inc. with the Merger being treated as the equivalent of Microvast, Inc. issuing stock for the net assets of Tuscan, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Tuscan are stated at historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded and are consolidated with Microvast Inc.’s financial statements on the Closing Date. Operations prior to the Merger are presented as those of Microvast, Inc. The shares and net loss per share available to holders of the Company’s Common Stock, prior to the Merger, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the Common Exchange Ratio established in the Merger Agreement.


In connection with the Merger, the Company raised net proceeds of approximately $705,129, including $482,500 of cash in connection with the PIPE financing and the contribution of $281,726 of cash held in Tuscan’s trust account from its initial public offering, net of redemptions of Tuscan public stockholders of $922 and $58,175 transaction costs.


In connection with the Merger, the Sponsor and related parties entered into the amended escrow agreement, pursuant to which 1,687,500 shares owned by the Sponsor Group (“Escrow Shares”) are subject to cancellation on conditions that: (i) 50% of 1,687,500 shares shall be cancelled if the last sale price of the Common Stock does not equal or exceed $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing, and (ii) 50% of 1,687,500 shares shall be cancelled if the last sale price of the Common Stock does not equal or exceed $15.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing. In accordance with ASC 815-40, the Escrow Shares were indexed to the Common Stock and were classified as equity.

11. PRODUCT WARRANTY



Movement of product warranty was as follows:



 | Year Ended December 31, | 
-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------
 | 2019 | | | 2020 | | | 2021
Balance at beginning of the period | $ | 16,565 | | | $ | 18,416 | | $ | 19,356 | 
Provided for new sales during the period | | 3,501 | | | | 3,477 | | | 6,447 | 
Provided for pre-existing legacy product | | - | | | | - | | | 46,485 | 
Utilized during the year | | (1,650 | ) | | | (2,537 | ) | | (13,830 | )
Balance at end of the year | $ | 18,416 | | | $ | 19,356 | | $ | 58,458 | 
Product warranty – current | $ | 3,723 | | | $ | 4,296 | | $ | 20,922 | 
Product warranty – non-current | | 14,693 | | | | 15,060 | | | 37,536 | 




Warranty provisions are based upon historical experience. Changes in provisions related to pre-existing legacy products were made based on actual claims and intensive testing and analysis on the legacy products. In 2021, as a result of the increases in the repairing cost and frequency of claims with respect to a legacy product sold in 2017 and 2018, the Company conducted intensive experiments and a root cause analysis, which was completed in October 2021. The Company concluded that a component purchased from a supplier was not meeting the Company’s performance standards. As a result, the Company expects that the impacted legacy products sold will need to be replaced before the expiration of the warranty term. This reassessment resulted in a change in estimate for additional accrual of $46,485 for such legacy product sold. As the component was not incorporated into other products, no additional accrual was made to other existing products sold. The Company is in negotiation with the supplier for compensation and will take legal action if necessary.



12. BANK BORROWINGS



The Group entered into loan agreements and bank facilities with Chinese banks and a German bank.


The original terms of the loans from Chinese banks range from 4 to 12 months and the interest rates range from 3.80% to 6.00% per annum. As of December 31, 2021, the balance of the loans from Chinese banks were $13,301.


The bank facility agreement with the German bank includes a $13,013 (EUR11 million) 8-year maturity term loan and a $4,732 (EUR4 million) revolving facility (“German Bank Facility Agreement”). The interest rate of the 8-year maturity term loan is EURIBOR plus a margin rate determined by the financial leverage ratio of the Group. The $4,732 (EUR4 million) revolving facility at 6.00% annual interest, needs to be renewed every year (60 days in advance). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group drew down the 8-year maturity term loan to the amount of $9,660. On October 1, 2021, the Company entered into the termination agreement with the German Bank to cancel the German Bank Facility Agreement. All outstanding amounts under the loan were repaid on October 8, 2021.

14. BONDS PAYABLE - continued



Convertible Bonds issued to Huzhou Saiyuan



On December 29, 2018, MPS signed an agreement with Huzhou Saiyuan, an entity established by the local government, to issue convertible bonds to Huzhou Saiyuan for a total consideration of $87,776 (RMB600 million), of which $29,259 (RMB200 million) was converted from the existing non-interest-bearing loan with Huzhou Saiyuan as of December 31, 2018. The Company pledged its 12.39% equity holding over MPS to Huzhou Saiyuan to facilitate the issuance of convertible bonds. Besides the previous converted bond of $29,259 (RMB200 million), Huzhou Saiyuan further subscribed for $14,629 (RMB100 million) on January 9, 2019 and $29,259 (RMB200 million) on February 1, 2019, respectively.


If the subscribed bonds are not repaid by the maturity date, Huzhou Saiyuan has the right to dispose of the equity interests pledged by the Company in proportion to the amount of matured bonds, or convert the bond to the equity interests of MPS within 60 days after the maturity date. If Huzhou Saiyuan decides to convert the bonds to equity interests of MPS, the equity interests pledged would be released and the convertible bonds should be converted to the equity interest of MPS based on the entity value of MPS at $950,000.


On September 28, 2020, MPS signed a supplemental agreement for extension on repayment of convertible bonds to Huzhou Saiyuan, and the terms on repayments and interests are as follows:



Issuance Date | Subscribed Amount | Maturity Date | Repayment Amount | Annual Interest Rate
------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------------
February 1, 2019 | $29,259 (RMB200 million) | June 30, 2023 | $29,259 (RMB200 million) | 3%~4% 
December 31, 2018 | $29,259 (RMB200 million) | April 28, 2024 | $14,629 (RMB100 million) | 0%~4%

 | | October 1, 2024 | $7,315 (RMB50 million) | 0%~4% 
January 1, 2020 | $14,629 (RMB100 million) | April 13, 2026 | $14,629 (RMB100 million) | 3%~4% 




An additional one-year extension could be granted to the Group if the Group submits a written application before the extended maturity date.


Bonds payable are carried at amortized cost and accrued interests are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. See Note 10. As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance of the convertible bonds to Huzhou Saiyuan totaled at $73,147 (RMB500 million).

14. BONDS PAYABLE - continued



Convertible Bonds issued to third-party investors



On November 2, 2018, MPS signed a convertible bond agreement with CL Investors, through which the CL Investors agreed to provide a non-interest bearing loan in an aggregate amount of $58,516 (RMB400 million) or up to $73,147 (RMB500 million) to MPS, and the CL Investors could convert the bonds into a number of Series D2 preferred shares of the Company (the “Series D2 Preferred”) once approvals from the PRC and US government were obtained. As of December 31, 2020, $29,915 (RMB204.5 million) was subscribed by the CL Investors.


On July 23, 2021, upon the completion of the Merger between Microvast, Inc. and Tuscan, the convertible bonds were settled and converted into 6,719,845 shares of Common Stock of the combined company. Refer to Note 3.


Convertible Notes at Fair Value (the “Bridge Notes”)



On January 4, 2021, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement to issue $57,500 convertible promissory notes to certain investors, fully due and payable on the third anniversary of the initial closing date. The notes bore no interest, provided, however, if a liquidity event (“Liquidity Event”) had not occurred prior to June 30, 2022, an interest rate of 6% would be applied retrospectively from the date of initial closing. The conversion of the Bridge Notes were contingent upon the occurrence of a PIPE financing, a Liquidity Event or a new financing after June 30, 2022 but before the maturity date (“Next Financing”). The first tranche and second tranche of the Bridge Notes were issued in January 2021 and February 2021 at amounts of $25,000 and $32,500, respectively. A discounted rate of 80% or 90% was required to be applied upon conversion, depending on the circumstances of PIPE financing, Liquidity Event or Next Financing.


The fair value option was elected for the measurement of the Bridge Notes. Changes in fair value at a loss of $9,861 was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.


On July 23, 2021, upon the completion of the Merger between Microvast, Inc. and Tuscan, the Bridge Notes were converted into 6,736,106 shares of Common Stock of the combined company as disclosed in Note 3.



15. WARRANTS 



Upon the Merger, the Company assumed 27,600,000 publicly-traded warrants (“Public Warrants”) which were issued in connection with Tuscan’s initial public offering. The Company also assumed 837,000 private placement warrants issued to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) (“Private Warrants” and together with the Public Warrants, the “Warrants”) upon the Merger, all of which were issued in connection with Tuscan’s initial public offering (other than 150,000 Private Warrants that were issued in connection with the closing of the Merger). The Warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share of the Company’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2021, none of Public Warrants and Private Warrants were exercised.


The Public Warrants became exercisable 30 days after the completion of the Merger. No Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company registered Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants with the SEC. Since the registration of Common Stock was not completed within 90 days following the Merger, warrant holders may exercise the Warrants on a net-share settlement basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Merger or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

15. WARRANTS - continued



Once the Public Warrants became exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants:



● | in whole and not in part;
--+--------------------------


● | at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
--+---------------------------------


● | upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company’s Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a net-share settlement basis.


The Public Warrant was determined to be equity classified in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.



The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a net-share settlement basis, at the holder’s option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. In addition, so long as the Private Warrants are held by EarlyBirdCapital and its designee, the Private Warrants will expire five years from the effective date of the Merger.


The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrants.


The Private Warrants were initially recognized at fair value of $3,574 in warrant liability upon Merger, and subsequently remeasured at fair value. A remeasurement gain of $2,469 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 in the consolidated statements of operations.


The Private Warrants were valued using the following assumptions under the Monte Carlo Model that assumes optimal exercise of the Company’s redemption option at the earliest possible date:



 | July 23, 2021 | | | December 31, 2021 | 
-----------------------------+----------------+-------+---+--------------------+--
Market price of public stock | $ | 10.00 | | | $ | 5.66 | 
Exercise price | $ | 11.50 | | | $ | 11.50 | 
Expected term (years) | | 5.00 | | | | 4.57 | 
Volatility | | 54.14 | % | | | 50.80 | %
Risk-free interest rate | | 0.72 | % | | | 1.20 | %
Dividend rate | | 0.00 | % | | | 0.00 | %




The market price of public stock is the quoted market price of the Company’s Common Stock as of the valuation date. The exercise price is extracted from the warrant agreements. The expected term is derived from the exercisable years based on the warrant agreements. The expected volatility is a blend of implied volatility from the Company’s own public warrant pricing and the average volatility of peer companies. The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of US Government Bond with maturity close to the expected term of the warrants. The dividend yield was estimated by the Company based on its expected dividend policy over the expected term of the warrants.

16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT



Measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis



The Group measured its financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and warrants at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued based on the quoted market price in an active market. The fair value of the warrant liability and Bridge Notes are based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. In determining the fair value of the warrant liability, the Company used the Monte Carlo that assumes optimal exercise of the Company’s redemption option at the earliest possible date. See Note 15.  


As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, information about inputs for the fair value measurements of the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is as follow:

Measured or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis



The Group measured the fair value of the Company’s convertible redeemable preferred share and the redeemable noncontrolling interests of a subsidiary on each of the date when there are changes in the terms of shareholding rights and preferences. The fair value was determined using models with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs), among which, the Group applied a Discounts For Lack Of Marketability (“DLOM”) of 20% in the fair value measurement for the convertible redeemable preferred share and redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2019, since there was no readily available market for shares in a closely-held company similar to the Company.


The Group measured the fair value of the long-lived assets using the income approach—discounted cash flow method, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable.

17. INCOME TAXES



US



The Company is incorporated in the U.S. and is subject to the U.S. state and federal income tax. Net operating loss incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 are permitted to be carried forward indefinitely but may not be carried back.


On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted and signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act includes measures to assist companies, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws. The CARES Act contains several corporate income tax provisions, including making remaining alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits immediately refundable; providing a 5-year carryback of net operating losses (NOLs) generated in tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020. NOLs arising in 2018, 2019, and 2020 can be 100% utilized if taxable income was generated prior to 2021.  Any portion of an NOL that arises in a tax year beginning in 2018, 2019, or 2020 that is not absorbed prior to a tax year beginning before 2021 is subject to the 80 percent limitation in tax years beginning after 2020. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.


PRC



Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (the “EIT Law”), PRC enterprise income tax is generally calculated at 25% of the Company’s subsidiaries located in the PRC as determined in accordance with the EIT Law, except for certain subsidiaries which enjoy tax rates substantially lower than 25% due to incentive policies.


MPS was recognized as a “New and High Tech Enterprises” (“NHTE”) by relevant PRC government authorities in 2012 and received renewal of its NHTE status in 2015, 2018 and 2021. Therefore, MPS, as the NHTE, is entitled to a rate of 15% for 2019, 2020 and 2021.


Huzhou Hongwei New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Hongwei”) was recognized as a NHTE by relevant PRC government authorities in 2020 and it is entitled to a rate of 15% for 2020 and 2021.


The withholding tax of 10% under the EIT Law is imposed on dividends declared to foreign investors with respect to profit earned by PRC subsidiaries from January 1, 2008 onward. Deferred tax liability was not provided with respect to undistributed profits of relevant PRC subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, as the Group concluded that profits generated by the relevant PRC subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested, because the Group does not have any present plan to pay any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the foreseeable future and intends to retain all of its available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business.


UK



UK corporation tax is calculated at an average tax rate of 19% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The estimated assessable profit generated by the Company’s subsidiary located in UK would be imposed the enterprise income tax at such rate, in accordance with the Corporation Tax Acts. The Company did not have taxable profit and no corporation tax expense was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.F-37

18. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS



Noncontrolling interests of MPS



In March 2017, Microvast, Inc. sold 17.39% equity interest of its wholly-owned subsidiary, MPS, to eight third-party investors (the “Investors”) for total cash consideration of $400,000, which was received in 2017.


In February 2018, Microvast, Inc. signed a series of repurchase and redemption agreements with six out of the eight investors of MPS which requested to redeem in aggregate 14.05% equity interests in MPS (“Exiting Investors”), at a redemption value equal to the initial capital contribution plus 6.00% simple annual interest. To facilitate the repurchase and redemption transaction, MPS and the Exiting Investors entered into certain property mortgage agreements on May 30, 2018. As a result, the Group reclassified the outstanding balance of noncontrolling interest as liability (included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities line items as payable to exiting investors) and measured at amortized cost. See Note 10 and 13.

20. PREFERRED SHARES - continued



In 2018, upon issuance of the convertible bonds to third-party investors, the Company signed a contribution and issuance agreement with the existing preferred shareholders, in which all the preferred shareholders of the Company agreed that when contribution conditions from bond holders are met, the existing shareholders will exchange their respective Series A1, Series B1 and Series EEL Preferred where Series C1 Preferred shares (“Series C1 Preferred”) is for Series A1 Preferred shareholders, Series C2 Preferred shares (“Series C2 Preferred”) is for Series B1 Preferred shareholders, and Series D1 Preferred shares (“Series D1 Preferred”) is for Series EEL Preferred, respectively, with amended preferential rights. In 2019, contribution conditions were met and the Series C1 (formerly A1), C2 (formerly B1) and D1 (formerly EEL) Preferred were issued.

As this transaction resulted in extinguishment of preferred shares, the Group re-measured the fair value of A1/C1, B1/C2 and EEL/D1 Preferred at the transaction date, which led to a decrease of $61,138 in fair value. The decrease in the fair value amount of the redeemable preferred shares was recorded as a change in additional paid-in capital.


On July 23, 2021, upon the completion of the Merger between Microvast, Inc. and Tuscan, all preferred shares were converted into Common Stock of the combined company at the Common Exchange Ratio of 160.3 as disclosed in Note 3.

21. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT



In 2012, Microvast, Inc. adopted a Share Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”). The 2012 Plan permits the grant of options to purchase common stock, share appreciation rights, non-vested shares and non-vested share units. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to all awards under the share incentive plan is 17 percent of the total issued and outstanding company shares on a fully-diluted basis. The share options, non-vested shares and non-vested share units granted to the employees or nonemployees shall vest and become non-forfeitable with respect to one-third of the total number of the non-vested share and non-vested share units immediately upon the occurrence of initial public offering, sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the business, operations or assets of Microvast, Inc. or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to a third party, or such other sale or transfer of common stock in Microvast, Inc. as determined, in each case, by Microvast, Inc. pursuant to legal documents and other obligations binding upon it (the “Initial Vesting Date”), and on each of the first and second anniversaries of the Initial Vesting Date; provided that through each applicable vesting date, the employee or nonemployee is employed. The Merger in 2021 did not constitute the satisfaction of a performance condition that would trigger the vesting of equity awards as stipulated in the 2012 Plan.


In connection with the Merger, all outstanding share awards granted under the 2012 Plan, 209,906 options and 143,652 capped non-vested share units, were converted into 33,647,927 options and 23,027,399 capped non-vested share units of the Company, respectively, using the Common Exchange Ratio of 160.3 as described in Note 3. Upon conversion, the Company modified the terms of the equity awards by removing the performance condition of the occurrence of an initial public offering and similar transaction under the 2012 Plan, and adopted a new vesting schedule of one-third of the total number on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing Date (the “Modification”). The Modification was considered a Type III modification under the Accounting for Share-Based Payments (Topic 718), in which the original awards were canceled, and the modified awards were considered granted on the modification date. Post-modification share-based compensation expense related to these new awards will be recognized over the remaining service period using modification date fair values. Following the Merger, no further awards will be granted under the 2012 Plan. All stock award activity was retroactively restated to reflect the conversion.


On July 21, 2021, the stockholders of the Company approved the Microvast Holdings, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), effective upon the Closing Date. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock option, restricted stock units, restricted share awards, stock appreciation awards, and cash-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. Options awarded under the 2021 Plan expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The 2021 Plan reserves 5% of the fully-diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Closing Date (not including the shares underlying awards modified from the 2012 Plan) for issuance in accordance with the 2021 Plan’s terms. As of December 31, 2021, 76,613,244 shares of Common Stock was available for grant under the 2021 Plan.

The capped non-vested shares units represent rights for the holder to receive cash determined by the number of shares granted multiplied by the lower of the fair market value and the capped price, which will be settled in the form of cash payments. The capped non-vested shares units were accounted for as liability classified awards. Upon conversion, the Company adjusted the terms of capped non-vested shares units outstanding as described above.

21. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT - continued



Restricted Stock Units



Following the Merger, the Company granted 398,811 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and 328,789 performance-based restricted stock unit (“PSU”) awards subject to service, performance and/or market conditions. The service condition requires the participant’s continued services or employment with the Company through the applicable vesting date, and the performance condition requires the achievement of the performance criteria defined in the award agreement. The market condition is based on the Company’s TSR. For RSU awards with performance conditions, stock-based compensation expense is only recognized if the performance conditions become probable to be satisfied.


The fair value of RSUs is determined by the price of Common Stock at the grant date and is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of PSU awards that include vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. Compensation cost for PSU awards is recognized based on the grant date fair value which is recognized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Accordingly, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $434 related to these RSU awards and $323 related to these PSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2021.


The following assumptions were used for respective period to calculate the fair value of common shares to be issued under TSR awards on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo pricing model:



 | Year Ended December 31, 2021 | 
------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+--------------
Expected term (years) (1) | | 2.18-2.35 | 
Volatility (2) | | 63.06%-64.31 | %
Average correlation coefficient of peer companies (3) | | 0.7960-0.8120 | 
Risk-free interest rate (4) | | 0.31%-0.55 | %
Expected dividend yield (5) | | 0.00 | %


(1) | Expected term
----+--------------




Expected term was derived from award agreements.



(2) | Volatility

The volatility of the underlying common shares during the lives of the awards was estimated based on the historical stock price volatility of comparable listed companies over a period comparable to the expected term of the awards.



(3) | Average correlation coefficient of peer companies
----+--------------------------------------------------




The correlation coefficients are calculated based upon the price data used to calculate the historical volatilities and is used to model the way in which each entity tends to move in relation to its peers.



(4) | Risk-free interest rate

Risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the market yield of US Government Bond with maturity close to the expected term of the options, plus country risk spread.

Series B2 Preferred subscribed by employees



On October 30, 2015, the Company issued 79,107 Series B2 Preferred to certain employees of the Company. The Series B2 Preferred were issued for cash consideration of $366.00 per share (“Series B2 Award”) and all the Series B2 Preferred were fully paid on the date of issuance. The Series B2 Award shall vest with respect to one-fourth of the total number immediately upon the occurrence of a qualified IPO or Initial Vesting Date, and on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Initial Vesting Date; provided that through each applicable vesting date, the holder of the Series B2 Award remains employed with the Company. If a holder of the Series B2 Award terminates employment before the vesting, the Company could repurchase the Series B2 Preferred for a per share price equal to the lower of the original Series B2 Preferred subscription price or 70% of the fair market value of such Series B2 Preferred. The Company’s repurchase right upon employment termination is viewed as forfeiture and the Company accounted for the Series B2 Award as a stock option.

21. SHARE-BASED PAYMENT - continued



Series B2 Preferred subscribed by employees-continued



As of December 31, 2020, 53,319 shares were legally issued and outstanding and the Company recorded a deposit liability of $21,792 at the per share price equal to the original Series B2 Preferred subscription price.


Upon the Merger, the Series B2 Preferred were converted into 8,545,490 Common Stock, however, the Series B2 Award was not vested as the performance condition was not reached. In September 2021, the performance and service condition was exempted for the Series B2 holders and the awards were fully vested. The exemption of performance and service condition was considered a Type III modification under the Topic 718, in which the original awards were canceled, and the modified awards were considered granted on the modification date. Post-modification stock-based compensation expense related to these new awards of $39,227 was recognized using modification date fair values determined based on the difference between the exercise price and Common Stock price on the modification date. Accordingly, the deposit liability was reclassified to equity upon the vesting.


The following summarizes the classification of share-based compensation:

23. STATUTORY RESERVES AND RESTRICTED NET ASSETS - continued



Because the Group’s entities in the PRC can only be paid out of distributable profits reported in accordance with PRC accounting standards, the Group’s entities in the PRC are restricted from transferring a portion of their net assets to the Company. In accordance with the Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment of China and their articles of association, a foreign invested enterprise established in the PRC is required to provide certain statutory reserves, namely general reserve fund, the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts, which is included in retained earnings accounts in equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. A wholly-owned foreign invested enterprise is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the general reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the board of directors for all foreign invested enterprises. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. If any PRC subsidiary incur debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the Group. Any limitation on the ability of the PRC subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to their respective shareholders could materially and adversely limit the ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to pay dividends.


The restricted amounts include the paid-in capital and statutory reserves of the Group’s entities in the PRC. The aggregate amount of paid-in capital and statutory reserves, which is the amount of net assets of the Group’s entities in the PRC (mainland) not available for distribution, were $156,333 and $378,506 as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.



 24. SEGMENT INFORMATION 



Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in businesses activities for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Group’s chief operating decision makers (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Group’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who reviews consolidated results including revenue, gross profit and operating profit at a consolidated level only and does not distinguish between products for the purpose of making decisions about resources allocation and performance assessment. As such, the Group concluded that it has one operating segment and one reporting segment.F-49

Litigation




● | Mr. Smith
--+----------




On September 4, 2017, Matthew Smith, a former employee of the Company, sent a demand letter to the Company alleging claims for breach of contract (involving stock options) and discrimination. On October 5, 2017, Mr. Smith filed a charge of discrimination with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) alleging the same discrimination claims and also claiming his employment was terminated in retaliation for his prior discrimination complaints. On September 18, 2019, EEOC dismissed Matthew Smith’s claim in its entirety and stated that “No finding is made as to any other issues that might be constructed as having been raised by this charge.”


On February 5, 2018, Mr. Smith filed suit against the Company asserting claims for breach of contract and asserting discrimination and retaliation claims. In this action, Mr. Smith seeks the following relief: (1) a declaration that he owns 416,702 ordinary shares (the number of shares were retroactively recast to reflect the exchange ratio established in the Merger) and (2) various damages and other equitable remedies over $1,000. The Company has denied all allegations and wrongful conduct. On November 11, 2021, the case was reset on the court’s docket, which postponed the trial until 2022.


The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and the amount of potential loss if any, associated with the resolution of such litigation, cannot be reasonably estimated. As such, no accrual for contingency loss was recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.
