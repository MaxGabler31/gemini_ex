Description of Business
 
Birdie Win Corporation is headquartered in Selangor, Malaysia. The Company primarily operates through providing financial literacy seminar services to Malaysian individuals and families. Our mission is to improve the financial well-being of our clients which coincides with the Malaysia National Strategy for Financial Literacy 2019-2023.
 
The Company believes there is enormous opportunity in promoting, and at the same time profiting from financial literacy in Malaysia. At present, the only service that has been provided by the Company is the one-on-one Personal Financial Literacy Seminar (herein referred as “PFL Seminar”). All other additional services are prospective, and have not, as of this point in time, been performed for any clients yet. We believe that we have the capacity to offer the services immediately upon securing an agreement with a client.
 
Our PFL Seminar focuses on elevating our clients’ financial literacy and teaching them responsible financial behaviors and rational attitudes towards financial management. Our PFL Seminar aims to improve clients’ awareness and capability to make rational financial decision throughout their life stages, which leads to sustained improvements in their financial behavior. We believe that raising financial literacy is a key to empower clients with the financial knowledge and skills to improve their financial well-being. Financially capable clients could interact responsibly with their financial service providers, which in turn builds a healthy financial lifestyle. At present, our PFL Seminar is taught solely by the Company’s President. We intend to hire additional instructors in the future, depending on the success of our operations, and will require that all instructors have relevant training/background and that the follow a standard of procedure (SOP), that has yet to be developed, in order to ensure that their lessons meet the quality standards we require.
 
Our PFL Seminar is a one-on-one workshop, presently conducted online via Zoom due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which consists of four sessions and the clients are expected to devote at least three hours per session as elaborated below:
 
Session 1: Financial Management Knowledge, Tool and Resources
 
Studies reveal that Malaysians lack sufficient confidence in their financial knowledge and skills. According to the Malaysia National Strategy for Financial Literacy 2019-20231, it was found that one-third of Malaysians rated their financial knowledge as low; while one-tenth felt that they were not disciplined when it came to their financial budgeting.
 
Session 1 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives:
 

1. | Knowledge of financial concepts; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Ability to live within means; 
3. | Management of expected and unexpected expenses; 
4. | Being vigilant to avoid financial scams; and 
5. | Ability to assess the risks and benefits of financial products and services. 

Session 2: Long-term Financial Planning Knowledge
 
Our research indicates Malaysians tend to save without clear goals and “live for today”, leaving them with insufficient funds for major expenses. According to the Malaysia National Strategy for Financial Literacy 2019-20231, it was found that 84% of Malaysians who claim to save regularly do so only for the immediate term. These savings are typically withdrawn by the end of the month with no accumulation of wealth. The absence of long-term goals leaves many Malaysians ill-prepared to deal with both expected and unexpected expenses such as loss of income, serious illness, accidents, pandemic, etc.
 
Session 2 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives:
 

1. | The use of innovation guides and tools to improve long-term financial planning; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Awareness and knowledge of the benefits of seeking appropriate professional advice on financial planning; 
3. | The importance of voluntary savings and income diversification; and 
4. | The importance of long-term financial plans for retirement. 

 
The desired outcomes of this session are inculcating clients with the habit of long-term planning for different life stages or events, such as marriage, having children, performing pilgrimage, death and illness. Clients will also be aware of the importance of funding sufficiency to meet their future financial needs and retirement life.
 
Session 3: Protect Your Money
 
We believe it is increasingly important to be financially literate in this era of digitization, as online information can be overwhelming and even inaccurate. Furthermore, as new financial products and services, such as internet banking and mobile payments, are growing in popularity, the capability to validate and verify such information is crucial before making any financial decisions.

Expectations of unrealistically high returns also increase the risk of falling victim to scams and illegal financial schemes. We believe with enough financial knowledge; our clients will be able to make the distinction between legitimate products and fraudulent schemes and be aware of avenues to seek help when in doubt.
 
Session 3 of our PFL Seminar enlightens clients with the above concerns and goes into detail on the following key learning objectives:
 

1. | Provide better understanding of risks and returns; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Improve awareness of the innovation of financial products and its implications; 
3. | Raise awareness on financial scams and fraud; and 
4. | Explain the risks of sophisticated financial products and services. 

 
Session 3 of PFL Seminar should increase clients’ awareness and understandings on the key features of certain financial products and services. They should also be able to identify suitable financial products based on their risk appetites and objectives and make rational financial decisions.
 
Session 4: Personal Financial Report Preparation and Analysis
 
Session 4 of our PFL Seminar equips our clients with the skills to generate their own Personal Financial Report by using third party financial planning software with goal-planning and scenario-based features. The Personal Financial Report should take into consideration of local financial markets system, social welfare system, quality of health care services, tax regulations and current economic indicators such as inflation rate, nominal real interest, regional GDP growth rate and unemployment rate.
 
We also educate our clients on how to analyze their Personal Financial Reports to understand their financial situations and evaluate to what extent their goals, needs and priorities can be met by their resources and current course of action. One useful function of the Personal Financial Report is financial ratio analysis which allows the client to evaluate their financial health. The financial ratio includes solvency ratio, investment assets to net worth ratio, debt to total assets ratio, debt to income ratio, liquidity ratio and saving ratio.
 
Based on the Personal Financial Report, we also equip clients with the skills needed to forecast their pre-retirement wealth accumulation and post-retirement expenses by assuming constant consumption and investment patterns. The Personal Financial Report also creates simulations of both optimistic and pessimistic wealth accumulation scenarios, including longevity risks. Additionally, if the client is married or in a long-term partnership, the plan should include survivorship considerations and projected financial scenarios for the surviving partner.
 
Session 4 of our PFL Seminar intends to empower our clients to be able to prepare and analyze their Personal Financial Report which provides guidance for rational decision-making and serves as both a roadmap to successful financial planning and a bulwark against potential mistakes or misdeeds. Our proposed content of the Personal Financial Report is as follows:
 

1. | Disclaimer 
---+------------------------------
2. | Financial Overview 
3. | Personal Information 
4. | Balance Sheet 
5. | Cash Flow 
6. | Financial Ratios Analysis 
7. | Financial Goals 
8. | Insurance Coverage 
9. | Investment Strategy 

 
We will not advise any specific insurance product or investment product issued by any financial institutes, including bank, insurance company, fund house, etc. This will enhance the independence and accuracy of the Personal Financial Report through avoidance of potential conflicts of interest. Instead of any specific insurance or investment product, we will recommend the proposed amount of sum insured for insurance portion while the asset class allocation for the investment strategy portion.
 
Once the client is satisfied with the Personal Financial Report generated, the client needs to decide the timing of implementation. We can accompany the client to visit different financial institutes and help to sort out the suitable products, which are relevant and consistent with their Personal Financial Reports, in order to avoid mis-selling or mis-matching between the client and products’ objective and risk.

Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program
 
Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program enables our existing clients to understand how their investment portfolio is performing and whether their financial goals are likely to be achieved. Our clients can subscribe to the program after their Personal Financial Reports are generated. We can review and re-assess a client’s Personal Financial Report to check whether their portfolio management is in line with their investment strategy, and whether any changes are required to achieve the clients’ goals. During the program, the client can obtain a better picture on their goal achievement progress, process consistency and portfolio performance. Furthermore, if there is any update on our program, we will invite those existing clients to join the updated session at a discounted fee.
Pricing
 
We generate our revenues by providing FPL Seminar services to Malaysian individuals and families. The one-time PFL seminar fees are typically a flat fee, which is currently proposed as $10,000 for each client.
 
Furthermore, we charge our clients who subscribe to our Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program recurring consulting fees. The amount is negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature and extent of our services, such as investor coordination, investment advisory services and distribution of periodic product performance reports computed.
 
Marketing Efforts
 
We believe word-of-mouth is an especially effective marketing tool for our business. We intend to engage in nationwide marketing initiatives to further raise our brand awareness while continuing to improve client satisfaction to strengthen our word-of-mouth referrals.
 
We expect to increase our marketing efforts through our President’s personal networks and industry association channels which have not, at this point of time, been fully identified. Our President leverages various resources in performing tasks, including their social connections and referrals from existing clients.
 
Additionally, we intend to bolster our professional reputation and image by showcasing our knowledge and industry expertise via marketing campaigns through various forms of media, including our website at www.birdiewin.com. We have undefined plans to initially market our services through webinars, the creation of a wide variety of white papers, newsletters, books, and other information offerings. Furthermore, we plan to begin a social media campaign utilizing blogs, twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. A targeted campaign is intended to be made to focus on individuals and families. At this point in time, we cannot state with any certainty when we will commence with the aforementioned marketing activities.
 
Competition
 
The financial literacy services industry is very competitive and fragmented in the market niche in which our Company operates. There are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market. A significant number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we possess. Additionally, we face substantial competition for potential clients and for technical and professional personnel from providers of similar specialties, which range from giant national wealth management firm, private banks and family offices headquartered in Malaysia.
 
The majority of our competitors are banks, wealth management firms, and insurance brokers who aim to sell their own products by providing financial literacy services. As such, we feel that we have a competitive advantage over many of our competitors, in that we do not sell any specific insurance or investment product, and instead strive to maintain our independence and avoid potential conflicts of interest. We believe that our clients will feel assured that the quality of our services and recommendations are not hampered by the need to sell any additional products.
 
We believe that existing and new competitors will continue to improve their services and introduce new services with competitive pricing and performance characteristics. In periods of reduced demand for our services, we can either choose to maintain market share by reducing our prices to meet competition or maintain prices, which would likely sacrifice market share. Sales and overall profitability could be reduced in either case.

Employees
 
Currently, we have one employee which is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chee Yong Yee. Currently, Mr. Yee has the flexibility to work on our business up to 30 hours per week, but is prepared to devote more time if necessary.
 
We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our employee, Officer and/or Director. We have no employment agreements at this time with our officers and directors. We intend to hire more staffs to assist in the development and execution of our business operations.
 
Government Regulations
 
Birdie Win Corporation solely provides financial literacy seminar services, and we will not take part in any distribution of financial products, such as insurance or investment products. We are not required to obtain any license that we are aware of except possibly business registration licenses in jurisdictions we may intend to operate in.
 
However, from time to time during one-on-one PFL Seminar and Personal Financial Report Review and Evaluation Program, the Company or employee of the Company will come across personal data as defined under Malaysia Personal Data Protective Act 2010 (herein referred as “PDPA”). According to PDPA, Data User, such as the Company or employee of the Company, shall not process personal data about a data subject unless the data subject has given his consent to the processing of the personal data.
