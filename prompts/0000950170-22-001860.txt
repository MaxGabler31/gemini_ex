Item 1. Business.
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics that selectively degrade disease-causing proteins by harnessing the body’s own natural protein degradation system. Our proprietary targeted protein degradation, or TPD, platform, which we refer to as Pegasus, allows us to discover highly selective small molecule protein degraders with activity against disease-causing proteins throughout the body. We believe that our small molecule protein degraders have unique advantages over existing therapies and allow us to address a large portion of the human genome that was previously intractable with traditional modalities. We focus on biological pathways that have been clinically validated but where key biological nodes/proteins have not been drugged or inadequately drugged. To date, we have utilized our Pegasus platform to design novel protein degraders focused in the areas of immunology-inflammation and oncology, and we continue to apply our platform’s capabilities to additional therapeutic areas. We have a mission to drug all target classes in human cells using TPD. Our current clinical stage programs are IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, and STAT3, which each address high impact targets within the interleukin-1 receptor/toll-like receptor, or IL-1R/TLR, and janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, or JAK/STAT, pathways, providing the opportunity to treat a broad range of immune-inflammatory diseases, hematologic malignancies, and solid tumors. Our programs exemplify our focus on addressing high impact targets that have been elusive to conventional modalities and that drive the pathogenesis of multiple serious diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
 In February 2021, we initiated the single ascending dose, or SAD, portion of our Phase 1 trial of KT-474 in adult healthy volunteers. In July 2021, we initiated the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion of the Phase 1 trial of KT-474 in healthy volunteers. We completed dose escalation in the SAD and MAD portions of this Phase 1 trial in December 2021. A subsequent patient cohort is expected to include hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS, and atopic dermatitis, or AD, patients. With respect to our IRAK4 program, we are collaborating with Sanofi S.A, or Sanofi, on the development of drug candidates targeting IRAK4 outside the oncology and immuno-oncology fields. In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory liquid and solid tumors, including aggressive lymphomas. We initiated our KT-333 Phase 1 clinical study in January 2022. In November 2021, we also announced that we received FDA clearance of our investigational new drug application, or IND, to evaluate our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, including MYD88 mutant diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We initiated our KT-413 Phase 1 clinical study in February 2022. Our next program, currently in IND-enabling activities, is a degrader against the E3 ligase MDM2. Our MDM2 degrader has been developed to stabilize the tumor suppressor p53 and address a wide variety of p53 wild type tumor types in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to discover, develop and commercialize novel and transformative therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious diseases, and we are committed to the selection of targets that enable a broad impact across multiple clinical indications with high unmet medical need. We believe the unique discovery capabilities of our PegasusTM platform will position us to be a leader in the area of TPD. Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with a pipeline of novel degrader medicines targeting disease-causing proteins that were previously intractable. We intend to achieve this goal by pursuing the following strategic objectives.
 •Advance the development of our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3 and MDM2 programs to deliver transformative therapies to patients. We maintain a core set of drug development principles which guide our protein target selection and our discovery and development efforts. We are specifically focused on delivering therapeutic solutions that reach previously inaccessible targets, in particular those in which the biological pathways are clinically and genetically well-validated, in order to address significant unmet medical needs within broad patient populations. We believe our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3 and MDM2 programs have the potential to treat multiple immune-inflammatory and oncology disease indications that fit these criteria.
 •Further expand the capabilities of our PegasusTM platform to identify the optimal pairing of therapeutic targets with E3 ligases for a range of disease states. Our TPD platform, PegasusTM, enables us to identify an expanded library of E3 ubiquitin ligases, or E3 ligases, to discover highly selective degraders with activity against disease causing proteins throughout the body. PegasusTM has the potential to help us better understand not only the optimal pairing of disease-causing protein targets with E3 ligases, but also the degradation profiles across different cell types and tissues, further enabling us to convert our differentiated E3 binders into novel degraders. We believe our ability to identify and utilize previously unliganded E3 ligases, particularly those with selective or restricted 


expression, may unlock new opportunities across broad therapeutic applications, including using novel E3 ligases to degrade undruggable and non-ligandable high value protein targets using small molecule molecular glues.
 •Continue to build a broad and diverse pipeline of novel protein degraders. Guided by our drug development principles and the learnings from our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, and STAT3 programs, we intend to continue to identify therapeutic targets that have disruptive therapeutic potential and are predicted to be well-suited for a TPD approach. For example, in December 2021, we disclosed our most recent degrader development candidate, KT-253, a potentially first-in-class MDM2 degrader in development for liquid and solid tumors. Given the unique genetic profiles in some of the patient populations that we aim to serve, we plan to continue to leverage a precision medicine approach to help identify patients with the highest probability of responding to our degrader drug candidates. The capabilities of our discovery platform, such as our expanded toolbox that includes E3 ligases beyond the two predominantly used in the field today, cereblon and von Hippel-Lindau, or VHL, enable us to pursue targets linked to a wider range of indications.
 •Expand and protect our proprietary know-how and intellectual property. We have developed a broad patent estate protecting our intellectual property, which we intend to expand to further protect our PegasusTM platform and the drug candidates we develop. Our intellectual property, which includes proprietary know-how as well as a series of patents, applies to not only our invented compounds but also to our E3 Ligase Whole-Body Atlas and our E3 Ligase Binders Toolbox.
 •Pursue synergistic collaboration opportunities. To further our goal of delivering transformative therapies to the broadest possible patient population, we intend to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. As part of this plan, in addition to our ongoing collaborations with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, and Sanofi, we expect to leverage additional strategic partnerships that can contribute complementary capabilities in discovery, development and commercialization in disease areas both within and outside of our core areas of therapeutic focus.
 
Background of Targeted Protein Degradation
 Proteins are responsible for the structure, function and regulation of tissues and organs. Cells in the body continuously synthesize and degrade proteins, maintaining an equilibrium called protein homeostasis. Most diseases are the result of aberrant protein behavior driven by activation, mutation, or downregulation of the protein itself, or by the gene responsible for the transcription and translation of that particular protein. With a deepened molecular understanding of various diseases and the characterization of the full human genome, research efforts have increasingly focused on the development of medicines to address malfunctioning proteins responsible for oncologic, auto-immune, cardio-metabolic, neurodegenerative, and rare genetic diseases.
 The ‘druggable’ genome challenge
 Several therapeutic modalities have been developed over the years to address aberrant protein activity. These have included small molecule inhibitors of protein function, therapeutic antibodies, oligo-based therapeutics such as RNA interference therapeutics, antisense oligonucleotides, or ASO, and other genetic therapies.
 Some of these modalities have had a tremendous impact on the treatment of diseases and quality of life of patients, and several others, while earlier stage, offer potential. However, these traditional modalities face specific challenges that limit their therapeutic impact and reach. Some of the limitations of existing modalities include the following:
 •Traditional small molecule therapeutics are unable to block the function of proteins without a catalytic or substrate binding site and cannot block proteins with dual function, as such are not effective against transcription factors, scaffolding and adaptor proteins, many of which play a key role in certain diseases.
 •Therapeutic antibodies are generally too large to penetrate cells and are therefore typically limited to protein targets that are extracellular, or outside of the cell, whereas most proteins are inside the cell. They also have to be dosed parenterally and can be costly and complex to develop and manufacture.
 •Oligo-based therapeutics are capable of drugging proteins elusive to small molecules in some cases but have significant drug delivery challenges with dosing and in achieving systemic distribution, greatly limiting the breadth of diseases they are able to address effectively. These therapeutics can also be costly and complex to develop and manufacture.


As a result of these limitations, we believe that only 20% of the full human genome has been effectively drugged to date. New therapeutic modalities which can overcome some of these challenges are necessary to expand the drugged proteome/genome and provide new efficacious medicines to patients in need. We believe that TPD is such a modality.
 Figure 1. Expanding the Druggable Human Proteome.
    
   Targeted Protein Degradation
 One of the methods that cells use to control the balance between the synthesis of new proteins and the degradation and disposal of damaged and/or misfolded proteins, is ubiquitin-proteasome system, or UPS. The discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation provided important insights into specific processes like cellular division and DNA repair and led to the discovery of UPS’ critical roles in various cellular pathways, including the cell cycle, signaling pathways, the regulation of gene expression, and responses to oxidative stress. The discovery of the UPS also revealed a new modality to harness this cellular process for the treatment of diseases.
 The UPS comprises a series of finely orchestrated enzymatic sequences that ultimately lead to protein polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome in cells. Protein ubiquitination is a cellular process involving an enzymatic cascade consisting of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3). In humans, there are two classes of ubiquitin activating E1 enzymes, more than 30 E2 enzymes, and approximately 600 E3 ligases.
 As illustrated in the figure below, the E3/E2/ubiquitin ligase complex (shown in blue) binds to a substrate protein (shown in purple) to mediate the transfer of ubiquitin, which leads to degradation of the target protein through the proteasome.


Figure 2. Natural Protein Degradation Through Ubiquitin-Proteasome System.
   
   Targeted protein degradation is a new modality that co-opts this innate cellular process. The core of the TPD modality consists of a small molecule (shown in magenta in the Figure 3 below) that we refer to as a heterobifunctional degrader. The role of this heterobifunctional degrader molecule is to mediate a “new” interaction through the formation of a ternary complex between a disease-causing protein and an E3 ligase. The E3 ligase tags the protein target for degradation by attaching a series of ubiquitin, and the proteasome recognizes the tagged protein and degrades it into small peptides.
 Forming an efficient ternary complex, as shown in step 2 in the figure below, is a critical step in TPD, and its formation, function, and effect on cellular and in vivo systems is vital to the success of the degradation and its impact on disease. In addition, the degrader molecule needs to be able to effect degradation in a variety of different cell types and contexts and have the right pharmaceutical properties to be therapeutically dosed to patients.
 As shown in the figure below, after the degrader facilitates the ubiquitination of the target protein, and as the protein is degraded by the proteasome, the molecule separates from the protein, and is able to form another ternary complex to conduct the degradation process again. This iterative mechanism is catalytic, which results in increased potency even at lower concentrations, another key differentiator from other modalities such as small molecule inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies.


Figure 3. Overview of Targeted Protein Degradation.
    Due to the unique advantages of TPD, this transformative modality is capable of targeting proteins traditionally undrugged by small molecules. Specifically, TPD can target proteins without a catalytic function such as scaffolding proteins and transcription factors, with small molecule-like drug properties that can potentially be dosed orally and distributed systemically unlike oligo-based therapeutics such as RNAi’s. TPD molecules also are amenable to existing small molecule manufacturing principles which are less costly than other therapeutic modalities. Because of the catalytic nature of the degradation process, we believe the modality has the potential to be therapeutically effective with smaller amounts of drug substance and less frequent dosing than traditional therapeutics.
 The use of small molecules to affect protein homeostasis has been clinically and commercially validated by multiple drugs over the past two decades. Drugs such as bortezomib and fulvestrant have been understood to inhibit the proteasome and target the estrogen receptor for proteasome-dependent degradation, respectively. More recently, immunomodulatory imide drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide have been understood on a post-hoc basis to direct the degradation of a series of transcription factors via the UPS.
 These immunomodulatory drugs have validated the concept of using the UPS to degrade proteins and elicit a pharmacological and therapeutic effect in disease settings. However, unlike earlier approaches in this field, TPD takes this proven concept further to prospectively target the degradation of a wider range of proteins through the rational design of heterobifunctional degraders which coordinate the discreet binding of target proteins and E3 ligases to drive the desired protein degradation.
 Currently, the field of TPD has largely been focused on the generation of heterobifunctional small molecule degraders against various targets by using the generally well-characterized E3 ligases, cereblon and VHL. Heterobifunctional degraders targeting either the androgen receptor or estrogen receptor for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer or advanced breast cancer are currently in Phase 2 and Phase 1 clinical testing, respectively. Both degrader compounds are oral drugs administered daily with early signs of acceptable pharmacokinetics and safety and, in the case of the androgen receptor degrader, preliminary evidence of tumor growth inhibition.
 An important factor for the efficiency of a degrader is the specificity and affinity to the targeted E3 ligase. The various E3 ligases have different distribution and cellular localization profiles that are important factors when considering which E3 ligase to use for a particular disease protein target. There are approximately 600 E3 ligases that occur in nature, but to date only a handful of these E3 ligases have been evaluated for therapeutic purposes, leaving a substantial portion of the genome available for targeting.
 Our PegasusTM Platform
 Our proprietary drug discovery platform, called PegasusTM, enables us to rationally design targeted protein degraders that have the potential to drug all target classes in the cell. Our approach is rooted in an understanding of the relationship between

E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins, which allows us to identify the properties that make a target both ligandable and degradable, and determine how multiple factors impact potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD. Key components of our platform include our E3 ligase ligand toolbox, our understanding of degradation across healthy and diseased tissue types, our proprietary chemistry and our newly established Center for Molecular Glue Discovery.
 •Expanded E3 Ligase toolbox. Our E3 ligase Whole-Body Atlas includes the expression profiles of approximately 600 unique E3 ligases. Using this Atlas, we are able to match target proteins with appropriate E3 ubiquitin ligases based on expression, distribution, intracellular localization and biology, a process that is enabled with our machine learning-based algorithms.
•Understanding of degradation across tissue types. Our Quantitative System Pharmacology Model measures and predicts a diverse set of parameters that impact target protein levels, based on an understanding of PK/PD, both in vitro and in vivo, and across healthy and diseased tissues and cell types.
    •Proprietary Chemistry. Our proprietary chemistry expertise enables the design and optimization of both E3 ligase and target protein binders, with artificial intelligence (AI) enabled insights, allowing for the opportunity to design of targeted protein degraders with optimal pharmaceutical properties.
    •Center for Molecular Glue Discovery. Our newly established Molecular Glue Center is focused on identifying novel tissue restricted or selective E3 ligases, beyond cereblon, that enable the design of molecules that target both undrugged and un-ligandable proteins through small molecule interactions.
 
Our Therapeutic Pipeline
 Our current clinical-stage programs are IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, and STAT3, which each focus on a single critical signaling node within the genetically and clinically validated IL-1R/TLR and JAK/STAT pathways. Additionally, we recently announced our next degrader candidate, KT-253, a potentially first-in-class MDM2 degrader in development for liquid and solid tumors. Our programs exemplify our focus on addressing high impact targets that have been elusive to conventional modalities and that drive the pathogenesis of multiple serious diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We believe degrading these targets has the potential to treat multiple immune-inflammatory diseases, hematologic malignancies, and solid tumors.
 We completed dose escalation in the healthy volunteer SAD and MAD portions of our clinical trial for KT-474 in December 2021. A subsequent patient cohort is expected to include hidradenitis suppurativa, or HS, and atopic dermatitis, or AD, patients. In November 2021, we announced we received FDA clearance of our INDs to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, and our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413. Both programs have initiated Phase 1 studies. We expect to file an IND for our MDM2 degrader, KT-253, in the second half of 2022.

We also have multiple programs in earlier stages of development and are exploring targets in therapeutic areas outside of our core areas of focus. The following table summarizes our development pipeline:
 

Our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3 and MDM2 Programs
 We are developing KT-474, a highly active and selective, orally bioavailable IRAK4 degrader, for the treatment of IL-1R/TLR-driven immunology-inflammation conditions and diseases with high unmet medical need, including HS, an inflammatory skin disease, as well as AD and rheumatoid arthritis. We have chosen to pursue IRAK4 degradation due to the well-validated role of the IL-1R/TLR pathway in immunology and inflammation and the potential advantage that drugging a single node of multiple different mediators of inflammation has over other approaches focused on targeting one of many cytokines that stimulate the IRAK4 node. IRAK4 is a critical node in the IL-1R/TLR signaling pathway, which is dependent on both IRAK4’s kinase activity and scaffolding function. We have observed through our in vitro and in vivo studies that KT-474 induces IRAK4 degradation, impacting both the kinase and the scaffolding functions, and therefore can efficiently and selectively block IL-1R/TLR-mediated inflammation in a way we believe to be superior to IRAK4 kinase inhibitors. We therefore believe KT-474 has the potential to improve outcomes over current treatment options as well as other drugs currently in development. In February 2021, we initiated the single ascending dose, or SAD, portion of our Phase 1 trial of KT-474 in adult healthy volunteers. In July 2021, we initiated the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion of the Phase 1 trial of KT-474, including healthy volunteers. The dose escalation in the SAD and MAD portions of this Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers was completed in December 2021. A subsequent patient cohort is expected to include hidradenitis suppurativa and atopic dermatitis patients. We are collaborating with Sanofi on the development of drug candidates targeting IRAK4 outside of oncology and immuno-oncology fields. See “Business—Collaborations—Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi.”
 We are developing another group of IRAK4 degraders, which we call IRAKIMiDs, with a unique profile that combines the activity of IRAK4 degradation and immunomodulatory imide drugs, or IMiDs, for the treatment of MYD88-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL. In oncology, IRAK4 is an obligate protein in MYD88 signaling and this activated mutation is well characterized to drive oncogenesis. IMiDs are a class of drugs that degrade zinc-finger transcription factors, such as Ikaros and Aiolos, resulting in the restoration of Type 1 interferon, or Type 1 IFN, signaling pathway which is relevant in treating lymphoma. Our IRAKIMiDs combine the activity of the IMiDs with IRAK4 degradation in a single agent and address both the IL-1R/TLR and the Type 1 IFN pathways synergistically and in doing so are designed to produce broad activity against MYD88-mutant lymphomas. In animal models, we have demonstrated that this combination in a single agent is superior to co-administering IRAK4 and IMiD agents. We believe this will be the first precision medicine in lymphoma to target a genetically defined population, which accounts for approximately 25% of DLBCL patients. We have observed that the functional synergy between the degradation of IRAK4 and IMiD activity results in broad activity against MYD88-mutant lymphomas in vitro and in mouse xenograft models, leading to rapid, complete and sustained tumor regressions, even when dosed intermittently. Further, we have seen additive and synergistic activity in vivo combining IRAKIMiD with ibrutinib (BTK), venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor), and rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), which are important back-bone therapies in these B cell lymphomas. In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate

our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, including MYD88 mutant diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We initiated the Phase 1 clinical study in February 2022.
 We are developing our selective STAT3 degraders for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors, as well as autoimmune diseases and fibrosis. STAT3 is a transcription factor activated through a variety of different cytokine and growth factor receptors via janus kinases, or JAKs, as well as through oncogenic fusion proteins and mutations in STAT3 itself. We believe the diverse functions of STAT3 in tumor biology, evasion of immune surveillance by tumor cells, and inflammation and fibrosis provide opportunities to address a wide variety of high unmet need disease indications through the targeting of a single genetically and clinically validated pathway. While the JAK-STAT pathway has been partially addressed with several clinically successful JAK-targeting agents, we believe there are currently no drugs that specifically affect STAT3 broadly across all the relevant cell types. Small molecule STAT3 dimerization inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain have been in development, but significant challenges remain: first, homology of SH2 domains among all STAT family members impacts the ability to achieve specificity for STAT3, and second, inability to block dimerization independent transcriptional activities of STAT3. For these reasons, we believe that STAT3 degraders may provide a transformative solution to the development of targeted and selective drugs to address multiple STAT3 dependent pathologies In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory liquid and solid tumors, including aggressive lymphomas. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical study in January 2022.
 We recently disclosed our degrader development candidate, KT-253, a potentially first-in-class MDM2 degrader in development for liquid and solid tumors. MDM2 is the crucial regulator of the most common tumor suppressor, p53 which remains intact in more than 50% of cancers. We believe that our highly potent MDM2 degrader, unlike small molecule inhibitors, has the ability to suppress the MDM2 feedback loop and can thereby potently and rapidly upregulate p53 expression and induce apoptosis with acute upfront exposures. We believe our MDM2 degrader has the potential to be effective in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors with functioning (wild type) p53. We expect to file an IND for KT-253 in the second half of 2022.
Our Approach to Target Selection
 We maintain a unique approach to target selection within the TPD field focused on targets within three distinct categories, as described below and shown in figure 4.
Inadequately Drugged (ID). We are focused on targets that have been inadequately drugged with other technologies and, importantly, where degradation provides a clear advantage over enzyme inhibition. We have identified and targeted proteins where removal offers superior therapeutic benefit versus inhibition of enzymatic activity or blockade of a binding site. Examples of targets we are pursuing in this category include IRAK4 and MDM2.
Undrugged Targets (UD). We are also exploring targets that are traditionally undrugged using other technologies. In some instances, ligands to these targets may exist and, while inadequate on their own for inhibition, have potential to serve as part of a heterobifunctional targeted protein degrader. Using such an approach, we have developed KT-333, which selectively degrades STAT3. In other instances, undrugged targets may have no known ligands and potentially no accessible small molecule binding sites which may make them poor candidates for both inhibitors and current heterobifunctional molecules. In these instances, we are pursuing a molecular glue approach in which a new surface on an E3 ligase is created via a small molecule with potential to engage the protein target of interest through a specific protein-protein interaction. An example of a target we are pursuing in this category is STAT3.
 Tissue Restricted (TR). The final category of targets includes targets which can uniquely be accessed using our proprietary human whole body E3 ligase Atlas. Our efforts here are focused on systematically identifying tissue sparing and tissue selective E3 ligases, which enables us to access clinically validated targets where on-target, unwanted pharmacology limits the clinical utility of small molecule inhibitors. We are currently working on a target in this category that is expected to enter clinical development in 2H22.
Figure 4. Our Approach to Target Selection
 

Our PegasusTM Platform
 Our proprietary drug discovery platform, PegasusTM, enables us to rationally design targeted protein degraders that have the potential to drug all target classes in the cell. Our approach is rooted in an understanding of the relationship between E3 ubiquitin ligases and target proteins, which allows us to identify the properties that make a target both ligandable and degradable, and determine how multiple factors impact potency, selectivity, PK and PD. Key components of our platform include our E3 ligase toolbox, our understanding of degradation across healthy and diseased tissue types, our proprietary chemistry and our newly established Center for Molecular Glue Discovery.
 We have developed a proprietary human whole body E3 Atlas for mapping expression patterns of all known human E3 ubiquitin ligases in both healthy and disease contexts by combining the power of quantitative, high-resolution proteomics with proprietary algorithms. We are refining the characterization of the expression profiles in healthy and diseased tissues of well-established liganded E3 ligases such as cereblon and VHL and, more importantly, of other naturally occurring E3 ligases, which remain unliganded to date. We have established subcellular localization indices for each E3 ligase and are determining their absolute abundances. We believe our approach is designed to overcome the limitations of relying on publicly available RNA or antibody-based protein expression datasets, which often lead to inaccuracies in determining relative E3 ligase expression levels in different biological contexts.
 Our proprietary E3 Ligase Whole-Body Atlas enables data-driven, disease-selective protein degradation strategies based on all of the mapped E3 ligases, which we view as a paradigm shift from relying on the limited number of E3 ligases typically exploited for TPD and provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. Using comparative analyses of expression patterns, we can identify selective pairings of E3 ubiquitin ligases with therapeutic targets of interest, including tissue-selective or tissue-restrictive pairings. We believe this approach is central to building out a toolbox of differentiated E3 ubiquitin ligase binders. Furthermore, we are able to use our custom-built Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Models in combination with proprietary data to understand the absolute abundance of E3 ligases and protein targets to predict cellular efficacy. Figure 5 below shows an example of diverse expression profiles, using circle size as a relative abundance measure, for E3 ligases and selected targets across a panel of healthy tissues (on the x-axis), taken from our proprietary E3 Ligase Whole-Body Atlas.
 



Figure 5. Novel E3 Ligases to Drug a New Generation of Targets
 

As an example of our work in this area, we have identified a tissue-selective E3 ubiquitin ligase that we believe, based on a comprehensive analysis using both proteomics and transcriptomics, is localized to a specific cell type, our target cell, and is not expressed in several other cell types. We believe this profile may allow for the selective degradation of a protein only in our target cells. We have fully characterized this novel tissue selective ligase and, through hit-finding campaigns, have identified unique chemical matter which has affinity for this E3 ligase below 1 uM. We have also shown productive ternary complex formation against the identified therapeutic target. Figure 6 illustrates, on the left, the tissue-selective expression of the E3 ligase and, on the right, the binding affinity of the lead compound and ternary complex formation with the target protein of interest.
Figure 6.
 


We are also developing targeted protein degraders directed against a well-validated and high-value oncology target that has known on-target heme toxicity. Utilizing our discovery platform, we have identified an E3 ligase that has very low expression in the target cell responsible for this toxicity, as illustrated in Figure 7 below in the Western Blot analysis.
Figure 7.
 
We have developed novel degraders for this oncology target that have demonstrated potent degradation of target type, as shown in the top panel of Figure 8. As illustrated in the middle panel, we have also shown that our degrader does not degrade

the target in the key blood cell type. Additionally, as shown in the bottom panel, when comparing this novel degrader, versus a well-known small molecule inhibitor, we were able to show that the degrader allows these blood cells to survive while the small molecule inhibitor led to substantial cell death. This is the first in vivo proof-of-concept of selectively degrading this target while avoiding known on target heme toxicity, which we believe is a significant advance that demonstrates the capabilities of our platform.
 Figure 8.
 

As illustrated in Figure 9 below table, we utilize a broad range of hit finding approaches to develop small molecules against our selected targets. Specifically, we use virtual screening and artificial intelligence enabled iteration to characterize the binding pocket of target proteins and E3 ligases, to evaluate ligandability and to find small molecule ligands. We also use high content screening such as DNA-encoded libraries (DEL), Affinity Selection Mass Spectrometry (ASMS) or traditional high throughput screening (HTS). We use Fragment Based Screening (FBS) and covalent screening for more targeted approaches where protein topology is understood. We also utilize X-ray and cryoEM capabilities to enable not only hit finding, but also ternary complex optimization. 
Figure 9.
 
As illustrated in Figure 10 below, our proprietary chemistry approach utilizes ternary complex modelling, which leverages cloud computing to evaluate millions of compounds with the objective to design both an optimal linker and to identify the correct vectors to enable efficient binding of both an E3 ligase ligand and protein ligand. We use molecular chameleonicity to accurately design and predict ADME and PK profiles of these complex molecules which is critical to designing molecules with high oral bioavailability. Our experienced chemistry and computational chemistry teams utilize artificial intelligence driven insights to understand those design parameters driving clearance, permeability and efflux.
Figure 10.
 

We also utilize a mechanistic modelling process to predict accurately both human PK and PD from preclinical data, an example of which is illustrated in Figure 11. We first applied an indirect PK/PD response model to describe the mechanism of action of TPD. We then accounted for the biodistribution of drug to target tissue and used an Emax exposure-response model to describe the mechanism of action of TPD. A preclinical PK/PD study was conducted in dog to understand the kinetics of protein degradation in tissues at different dose levels, with data used to estimate in vivo degradation potency and protein turnover rate in the target tissue. We then “humanize” the PK/PD model by applying human PK parameters, adjusting for species’ differences in potency and protein turnover rate, if necessary, to predict protein degradation in the clinic. As shown in the far right of Figure 11, the model accurately predicted human PD, as measured by predicted IRAK4 reduction, using preclinical PK/PD animal data (orange) to predict human PK/PD data in (blue).
Figure 11.
 

Our newly established Center for Molecular Glue Discovery is focused on identifying novel E3 ligases, beyond cereblon, that enable the design of molecules that target undrugged and un-ligandable proteins through small molecule interactions. Molecular glues, rather than requiring a defined binding pocket on the undruggable target, leverage a weak preexisting interaction between an E3 ligase and an unligandable protein of interest. Through binding of the molecular glue to the E3 ligase, the protein-protein interaction interface of the E3 ligase is remodeled, leading to enhanced interaction of the two proteins, thus facilitating degradation. Our approach is to move beyond the traditional approach of molecular glues, which mostly utilize cereblon/IMiD based molecular glues. We have recently established strategic partnerships with several academic centers and biotechnology research teams including A-Alpha Bio, the University of Washington and NYU. Our work with these groups is focused on identifying and characterizing novel E3 ligase/substrate pairs for molecular glue interactions that exploit natural affinity augmented with small molecules. We are utilizing genetic screening, structural insights, and pathway and computational biology to identify novel matched pairs of E3 ligases and high value undrugged targets.
Our Programs
 
IRAK4 Degrader for IL-1R/TLR-driven Immunology-inflammation Diseases
 
Summary
 We are developing KT-474, a highly active and selective, orally bioavailable IRAK4 degrader, for the treatment of IL-1R/TLR-driven immune-inflammatory conditions and diseases with high unmet medical need, including HS, AD and rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. We have chosen to pursue IRAK4 degradation due to the well-validated role of the IL-1R/TLR pathway in immunology and inflammation and the potential advantage that drugging a single node of multiple different mediators of inflammation has over other approaches focused on targeting one of many cytokines that stimulate the IRAK4 node. IRAK4 is a critical node in the IL-1R/TLR signaling pathway, which is dependent on both IRAK4’s kinase activity and scaffolding function. We have observed through our in vitro and in vivo studies that KT-474 induces IRAK4 degradation, impacting both the kinase and the scaffolding functions, and therefore can selectively block IL-1R/TLR-mediated inflammation in a way we believe to be superior to IRAK4 kinase inhibitors. We therefore believe KT-474 has the potential to improve outcomes over current treatment options as well as other drugs currently in development. In July 2020, we announced a strategic collaboration with Sanofi to develop and commercialize therapies targeting IRAK4 in patients with immune-inflammatory diseases. See the section entitled “Business—Collaborations—Collaboration Agreement with Sanofi” appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information.
 Biology and Mechanism of Action of IRAK4 Degrader
 IRAK4 is a key component of the myddosome, a multiprotein complex involved in innate immunity that mediates signaling through TLRs and IL-1Rs. The IRAK4 protein is ubiquitously expressed across multiple different tissue types, including skin, lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, and lung.
 The function of IRAK4 is dependent both on its kinase activity and on its scaffolding function, which are required for the assembly of the myddosome complex following TLR or IL-1R engagement and MYD88 activation. While the kinase function is primarily responsible for the phosphorylation events in the IRAK4-JNK axis, the scaffolding function is primarily

responsible for the NF-KB activation and downstream gene traction of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
 We believe IRAK4 degradation is superior to IRAK4 kinase inhibition as our preclinical data suggests that it is critical to block both the kinase activity and scaffolding functions of the IRAK4 protein, which requires removal, as opposed to just inhibition, of the protein. IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1a, IL-1ß, IL-18, IL-36, and IL-33, have been implicated in a variety of different immunology-inflammation conditions and diseases. As both TLRs and IL-1Rs are involved in the production and response to all of these IL-1 family cytokines, IRAK4 targeting with a single small molecule degrader could impact multiple different cytokines and chemokines and thereby provide a transformative approach to the treatment of IL-1R/TLR-driven diseases.
 
Figure 12. IRAK4 Function is Comprised of Both Kinase-Dependent and -Independent Activity.
             Development Opportunities and Differentiation from IL-1 Family Cytokine Antibodies
 There are numerous cutaneous, rheumatic and gastrointestinal immunology-inflammation disease indications for which pathogenesis involves IL-1 family cytokines as well as TLR stimulation. These present opportunities where we believe a highly efficient and selective IRAK4 degrader would provide significant advantages over both currently approved treatment options and those in clinical development. We are initially prioritizing indications such as HS, AD, and RA where there is clinical proof of concept for targeting cytokines impacted by the IL-1R/TLR pathway but for which there continues to be a high level of unmet need.
Figure 13.



Hidradenitis Suppurativa
 HS is a chronic, destructive, painful and debilitating inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 1% of both the U.S. and global population. Patients with HS have numerous painful, draining nodules and abscesses, usually within skin folds, that are characterized by inflammation and bacterial colonization. Currently HS is treated symptomatically with corticosteroids, antibiotics and surgery. The only FDA-approved treatment for HS is the anti-TNF antibody adalimumab, which provides some benefit to approximately 50% of patients with moderate-to-severe disease but is not curative. Thus, there remains a high unmet need for better therapies for the treatment of HS.
 Bacterial activation of TLRs, as well as the production of IL-1a, IL-1ß, and IL-36 by keratinocytes and inflammatory cells leading to inflammation characterized by high levels of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17, are central to the pathogenesis of HS. Monoclonal antibodies targeting individual cytokines such as IL-1a (bermekimab), IL-1a/ß receptor (anakinra), and IL-17 (secukinumab and bimekizumab) have shown preliminary clinical activity in HS and provide clinical validation for targeting the IL-1R/TLR pathway in HS. As such, an IRAK4 degrader which acts on multiple cytokines as well as TLRs has the potential to offer a significant advantage over the single-cytokine-targeting agents currently being developed.
 Atopic Dermatitis
 AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children but also affects adults. In the major global markets, the diagnosed prevalence of AD is estimated at 60.5 million patients, with approximately 40%, or 24 million, falling into the moderate-to-severe category. AD follows a chronic relapsing course over month to years, with dry skin and severe pruritus as the primary symptoms, sometimes accompanied by skin thickening from chronic scratching and fissuring. AD is treated symptomatically with topical therapies, including emollients, corticosteroids, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The lone FDA-approved systemic treatment is the IL-4Ra targeting antibody dupilumab, though only approximately 40% of moderate-to-severe disease patients met the primary endpoint in its Phase 3 trials, leaving a significant percentage of patients who are currently underserved.
 Furthermore, there is evidence that IL-33 and IL-1 are both involved in the generation of inflammation in both AD and other allergic diseases, including eosinophilic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. Single-cytokine-targeting monoclonal antibodies against IL-33 (etokimab) and IL-1a(bermekimab) have shown preliminary clinical activity in AD. Thus, we believe the ability of an IRAK4 degrader to impact the production of both IL-33 and IL-1, through complete TLR signaling blockade, and the cellular response to both cytokines, through complete IL-1R signaling blockade, provides a compelling mechanistic rationale for development in AD.
 Rheumatoid Arthritis
 RA is the most common inflammatory arthritis, affecting approximately 5 million individuals in the 7 major markets worldwide, with a prevalence of 0.7% of the U.S. population. The synovial inflammation characteristic of RA is driven by Th1 and Th17 immune responses with production of TNF-a and IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1, IL-18 and IL-33, IL-6 and IL-17. Multiple therapies targeting the IL-1R/TLR pathway are approved for RA, and recently an IRAK4 kinase inhibitor

(PF-06650833) has shown clinical activity comparable to the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib and a favorable safety profile in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study in RA patients with inadequate response to methotrexate. Based on these early signs of activation, we believe a degrader-based approach which impacts both the kinase activity and the scaffolding function of IRAK4 may have the potential for a more transformative effect on the disease.
 Preclinical Studies and Data
 Preclinically, we have observed KT-474’s high activity, selectivity and therapeutic potential in both in vitro and in vivo studies.
 Stimulation and Comparison to IRAK4 Kinase Inhibitors
 We assessed the functional activity of KT-474 by measuring pro-inflammatory cytokine levels upon activation. Cells were pretreated with KT-474, a negative control, and small molecule IRAK4 kinase inhibitors. Figure 14 below shows KT-474 is better able to inhibit IL-6 under both LPS and LPS + IL-1B than clinically active IRAK4 small molecule kinase inhibitors.
 Figure 14. IRAK4 Degradation Superior to Kinase Inhibition in Cytokine Production
    
      In Vivo Data
Topical application of the TLR7/8 agonist, imiquimod, or IMQ, induces skin thickening associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, activates the NF-KB pathway and IL-23/IL-17 axis, and produces IL-1 family cytokines from keratinocytes, recapitulating several key pathological features of skin inflammation, including HS and psoriasis. In this in vivo model, orally administered KT-474 inhibited topical IMQ-induced skin thickening, which was a reflection of local and systemic inflammation, to an extent comparable to a topical corticosteroid (clobetasol) at doses achieving at least 60-70% IRAK4 knockdown in skin and spleen (Figure 15).
Figure 15. KT-474 Downregulates IRAK4 Expression and Inhibits Skin Thickening in Mouse Imiquimod Model of Psoriasis
 


In a 14-day non-GLP toxicology study of daily, orally administered KT-474 in rats and non-rodents, the compound was well-tolerated at doses of up to 600 mg/kg in rats and 100 mg/kg in non-rodents. Notably, pharmacodynamic assessment showed complete knockdown of IRAK4 24 hours after the last dose on day 15 in multiple tissues including skin, spleen, lymph nodes and animal peripheral blood monocytes, PBMCs, as shown in Figure 16. Together, we believe this showed that nearly complete systemic degradation of IRAK4 was well-tolerated and supported the advancement of KT-474 into further development.
Figure 16. IRAK4 Knockdown in Tissues After 14 Days of KT-474 Dosing
 in Non-Rodent Non-GLP Toxicology Study
       
In addition, the reversibility of IRAK4 knockdown in vivo was observed in mice and non-rodents, where recovery of IRAK4 levels in blood (PBMC) and skin was observed within 48 to 72 hours following cessation of daily oral dosing. We

believe these data point to a potential safety advantage for TPD relative to genetic medicines approaches of protein knockdown, as cessation of the TPD agent is sufficient to restore protein levels back to steady state within a reasonable timeframe.
 The anti-inflammatory effect of KT-474 and its superiority to IRAK4 kinase inhibitors were also shown in vivo in various mouse models of inflammation. Figure 17 shows the effect of KT-474 on IRAK4 levels in whole blood and on measures of inflammation in intradermal challenge models using IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-33 and IL-36, and in a model of Th17-mediated multiple sclerosis. In these models, KT-474 outperformed an IRAK4 kinase inhibitor and was comparable to either potent corticosteroids or standard of care anti-inflammatory drugs at doses achieving over 85% IRAK4 knockdown in blood. Similar activity was observed in the mouse MSU-gout model, driven by TLR4 activation, and in the imiquimod-psoriasis model, driven by TLR7 and 8 activation.
 Figure 17.
 

In summary, we believe these preclinical data show that orally administered KT-474 was able to suppress safely and selectivelyIRAK4 expression in rodents and non-rodents, inhibit inflammation, including neutrophil infiltration, in murine models mechanistically relevant to the pathogenesis of HS, AD, and RA and potentially other diseases, and provide support for a potential therapeutic advantage of IRAK4 degradation over IRAK4 kinase inhibition.
Clinical Studies and Data
 In 2021, we completed dose escalation in the single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portions of the KT-474 Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. The primary endpoints of the Phase 1 trial are to determine the safety and tolerability of KT-474 when administered as daily oral doses at escalating dose levels. Secondary endpoints include characterization of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of multiple doses of KT-474 over an established timeframe.
 In the SAD portion of the trial, after a single dose of KT-474, strong, dose dependent IRAK4 degradation was observed in PBMC using mass spectrometry. Mean and median percent reduction from baseline for IRAK4, shown at the nadir 48 hours post-dose across each of the dose levels, demonstrated a steep dose-response, plateauing after the 600 mg dose. At single doses of 600-1600 mg, mean IRAK4 knockdown was 93-96%, with absolute IRAK4 protein levels approaching or exceeding the lower limit of quantitation for the highly sensitive mass spec assay, as shown in Figure 18.
 



Figure 18.
 


An ex vivo cytokine stimulation assay was used to establish proof-of-biology by demonstrating the impact of IRAK4 lowering in PBMC in vivo on the ability of TLR agonists to stimulate myddosome-dependent proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in whole blood ex vivo. Whole blood samples were drawn pre-dose and at various timepoints post-dose into TruCulture tubes containing either LPS, a TLR4 agonist, or R848, a TLR 7 and 8 agonist. After overnight incubation, supernatants were separated from cells and then analyzed for multiple disease-relevant cytokines and chemokines. Inhibition of ex vivo cytokine stimulation was associated with IRAK4 knockdown in PBMC of ≥85% at 24-48 hours post-dose. Results for LPS- and R848-induced cytokines in the top 2 dose levels are shown in Figure 19 as mean maximum inhibition at 24-48 hours compared to pre-dose baseline. Broad inhibition of multiple cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-17, among others, was seen for both LPS and R848, with maximum inhibition of up to 97%.
Figure 19.
 


In the MAD portion of the trial, as shown in Figure 20, 14 daily doses of KT-474 resulted in robust and sustained knockdown of IRAK4 in PBMC with low inter-subject variability across all dose levels, with steady-state degradation occurring

between Days 7 and 14 that approached the lower limit of quantitation for the highly sensitive mass spec assay in all cohorts. This was followed by recovery towards baseline by Day 28, 14 days post last dose.
 Figure 20.
 
Near complete IRAK4 degradation of up to 98% was observed in PBMC at steady state with multi-dosing as predicted based on the PK, plateauing after 100 mg, a substantially lower dose compared to over 600 mg that was required to maximize degradation following a single dose. The effect across all dose levels was highly significant relative to placebo, as shown in Figure 21.
Figure 21.
    Proof of mechanism in the skin was achieved through the demonstration of IRAK4 knockdown using mass spectrometry. As shown in Figure 22, baseline levels of IRAK4 in healthy adult skin were 5- to 10-fold lower than PBMC. Dose-dependent reduction was observed, with IRAK4 levels nearing the lower limit of quantification of the assay by Day 14 at the top dose of 200 mg, representing knockdown of up to 90%. Knockdown did not appear to be at steady state on Day 14, suggesting that continued dosing beyond 14 days could result in further decline in IRAK4 levels.
Figure 22.
 

As shown in Figure 23, dose-dependent inhibition of multiple disease-relevant cytokines and chemokines induced by either LPS or R848 was observed, comparable to the effect seen at the top SAD cohort of 1600 mg, with greater than 50% inhibition of most cytokines, and maximum inhibition of 85% at 100 mg.
Figure 23. Ex Vivo Inhibition of 9 Disease-Relevant Cytokines, Day 7-14
 

Blinded safety analysis of cohorts randomized 9:3, KT-474 to placebo, showed that multiple daily doses of KT-474 from 25 to 200 mg, leading to substantial IRAK4 knockdown for at least 21 days, were safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. The most common treatment related adverse events deemed possibly or probably related to KT-474 by investigators were mild to moderate headache, mild nausea and palpitations. The reported palpitations were self-reported, transient episodes during 21 days of inpatient observation that were not associated with any objective findings. Similarly, all other adverse events were self-limiting, and none led to interruptions in dosing.
Clinical Development Plan
 We plan to characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the recommended Phase 2 dose of KT-474 in an additional cohort of up to 20 AD and HS patients before initiation of Phase 2 studies. We expect that the combination of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints, including PK/PD relationships, will inform selection of one or more predicted-effective doses to take into subsequent proof of concept trials in our prioritized indications. Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled trials are expected to be conducted in one or more indications including, but not limited to, AD, HS, and RA.
 

IRAKIMiD Program in Oncology
 Summary
 We are developing another group of IRAK4 degraders, which we call IRAKIMiDs, with a unique profile that combines the activity of IRAK4 degradation and IMiDs for the treatment of MYD88-mutated DLBCL. In oncology, IRAK4 is an obligate protein in MYD88 signaling and this activated mutation is well characterized to drive oncogenesis. IMiDs are a class of drugs that degrade zinc-finger transcription factors, such as Ikaros and Aiolos, resulting in the restoration of Type 1 IFN signaling pathway which is relevant in treating lymphoma. Our IRAKIMiDs combine the activity of the IMiDs with IRAK4 degradation in a single agent and address both the IL-1R/TLR and the Type 1 IFN pathways synergistically with a goal of demonstrating broad activity against MYD88-mutant lymphomas. We believe this will be the first precision medicine in lymphoma to target a genetically defined population, which accounts for at least 25% of the estimated approximatley 150,000 DLBCL patients currently diagnosed in the major global markets. We have observed the degradation of IRAK4 and IMiD activity results in additivity and synergy in vitro. IRAKIMiDs combine both of these mechanisms in a single compound. Our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, has been observed to have broad activity against MYD88-mutant lymphomas in vitro and in mouse xenograft models, leading to rapid, complete and sustained tumor regressions, even when dosed intermittently. In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, including MYD88 mutant diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL). We initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in February 2022.
Target Rationale and Mechanism of Action
 In DLBCL, the activating mutation of MYD88 drives activation of the NF-KB transcription factor and pro-survival mechanisms such as IRF4. MYD88 is a protein that forms a multiprotein signaling complex, known as the myddosome, which transduces receptor agonism from both the TLR and IL-1 b receptors. IRAK4 is an integral component of the myddosome, and both its catalytic kinase activity as well as its scaffolding function are required to drive downstream signals from the myddosome.
 The constitutive activation of NF-KB is a hallmark of several B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In DLBCL, NF-KB activation is driven by a range of oncogenic alterations in several upstream pathways and regulators. Multiple co-mutations in these complexes often occur within the same tumor, emphasizing the dependence of these cancers on NF-KB activation. IMiDs such as lenalidomide drive a partial downregulation of NF-KB and IRF4, resulting in the restoration of Type 1 IFN signaling and promoting cell death.


Figure 24. NF-KB is Activated by Complimentary Mechanisms in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.
          
Leveraging knowledge and chemistry expertise derived from the design of our selective IRAK4 degrader program, we have designed a novel class of heterobifunctional IRAK4 degraders, which we call IRAKIMiDs, that utilize an active IMiD as the cereblon binder to simultaneously engage and degrade both IRAK4 and IMiD substrates, such as Ikaros and Aiolos, thus combining the activity of two molecules in a single agent. IRAKIMiDs therefore combine two highly relevant therapeutic mechanisms in a single compound, enabling the functional synergy of NF-kB inhibition and upregulation of the Type 1 IFN response that results in increased and broader single-agent activity in MYD88-mutated DLBCL as compared to either mechanism alone.

   Development Opportunities and Differentiation of Novel Therapies in MYD88-Mutated DLBCL


Oncogenic mutations of MYD88, most commonly MYD88L265P, are common in several subsets of DLBCL. In particular, MYD88 is estimated to be mutated in approximately 30-40% of activated B cell DLBCL, or ABC-DLBCL, cases; 30-80% of primary CNS lymphoma cases; and 45-75% of primary extranodal lymphomas cases. In addition, MYD88 is mutated in approximately 90% of Waldenström macroglobulinemia cases. The presence of MYD88 mutations in DLBCL is often associated with poorer response to chemotherapy and reduced overall survival compared to other genetic subtypes, supporting the need for more effective therapies targeting MYD88-mutated DLBCL.
 Front-line treatment of DLBCL typically involves the R-CHOP treatment regimen of chemotherapy combined with rituximab. While effective in many other patients, front-line chemotherapy has significantly poorer survival rates in DLBCL subsets where MYD88 mutations are prevalent. In additional lines of therapy, several novel targeted therapies have been approved recently, including the combination of polatuzumab, bendamustine and rituximab, as well as CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells. While these agents have some notable activity, many patients fail to respond to or subsequently relapse from these therapies, with no adequate treatment options. Several targeted therapies that impact the NF-kB pathway, such as the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, or the IMiD lenalidomide, have shown modest single agent activity, with poor durability of response in MYD88-mutated DLBCL.
 Based on our preclinical data, we believe KT-413, which synergistically combines the activity of both IRAK4 and IMiD substrate degradation to exploit complimentary pathway signaling, will have the potential to improve upon the efficacy of IRAK4 kinase inhibitors and other therapies, including BTK inhibitors and IMiDs, and provide single-agent activity in MYD88-mutated DLBCL.
 Preclinical Studies and Data
 In support of our preclinical development, we have observed our IRAKIMiD degraders’ high selectivity and therapeutic potential in both in vitro and in vivo studies.
 To assess the activity of our IRAKIMiD degraders in both MYD88-mutated and -wild-type cells lines, we conducted various in vitro studies in a panel of cell lines. MYD-88-mutated cell lines included ABC-DLBCL lines such as OCI-Ly10, SUDHL2, and TMD8 while MYD-88-wild-type cell lines included OCI-Ly19, U2932, and SUDHL6. We have shown that IRAK4 degradation, as opposed to IRAK4 inhibition, shows additivity and synergy when combined with IMiDs in vitro. Specifically, combining an IRAK4 degrader with the IMiD pomalidomide shows additive and synergistic activity in several MYD88-mutated cell lines in vitro, supporting the combined effect of targeting both the MYD88 and IRAK4 pathways together. Notably, we did not see an additive effect when IRAK4 kinase inhibitors were combined with IMiDs, suggesting that the greater activity of IRAK4 degradation is needed for synergistic activity. We believe these data support the development of our unique class of IRAKIMiD degraders.
 As shown graphically in Figure 26, KT-413 is a potent degrader of IRAK4 and the IMiD substrates, Ikaros and Aiolos with single digit nM DC50 values against all three targets with maximal growth inhibition observed with approximately 80% target knockdown.


Figure 26.
 


As shown in Figure 27, KT-413 is more potent and more active in MYD88-mutated DLBCL than either an IRAK4-selective degrader compound, or a clinically active IMiD, supporting our hypothesis that simultaneous degradation of IRAK4 and IMiD substrates is more effective than degrading either alone.
Figure 27.
    
   Figure 28 summarizes results of in vivo experiments in xenograft models of MYD88 mutant DLBCL demonstrating profound antitumor activity with durable complete responses in animals treated with KT-413 on intermittent dosing schedules as infrequent as every 2 or 3 weeks. As shown, this level of activity is superior to that of an IRAK4 kinase inhibitor or the clinically active latest generation IMiD compound.
Figure 28.
 

Figure 29 highlights the unique PK/PD properties of KT-413 that result in protracted tumor exposure and robust knockdown of the targets for at least 72 hours, committing tumor cells to apoptosis that leads to tumor regressions.
Figure 29. Super Anti-Tumor Activity
 


In addition to the robust single agent antitumor effects of KT-413, Figure 30 summarizes the combination data with agents used in the treatment of lymphoma. In these experiments conducted in MYD88 mutant DLBCL models, sub-optimal doses of KT-413 combined with ibrutinib (BTK) venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor), or rituximab (Rituxan, an anti-CD-20 monoclonal antibody), showed deep and durable regressions highlighting the potential of KT-413 combination to be used in earlier lines of therapy in patients with MYD88 mutant lymphoma.
Figure 30.
 

Clinical Development Plan
 In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our IRAKIMiD degrader, KT-413, in a Phase 1a/1b trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KT-413 administered intravenously, once every three weeks. In the Phase 1a part, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas will be treated in escalating doses until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is identified. The IRAKIMiD Phase 1b expansion part is then expected to enroll patients with both MYD88 mutant and MYD88 wild-type relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Efficacy will be assessed in both Phase 1a and 1b, and exploratory endpoints will include pharmacodynamic assessments including knockdown of IRAK4, Ikaros, and Aiolos, and downstream effects in peripheral blood as well as in tumor biopsies. Based on the observed safety, PK/PD, and clinical activity of single agent KT-413, the protocol may be amended to include evaluation of KT-413 combinations with standard of care agents and to evaluate monotherapy KT-413 in other MYD88 mutant lymphomas.
Developing IRAK4-selective Degraders for Other Hematologic Malignancies and Solid Tumors
 In addition to our IRAKIMiD program, we are also exploring the therapeutic potential of IRAK4-selective degradation without IMiD biology, in both liquid and solid tumors, as there are certain cancers where this approach may be effective either as a monotherapy or in a combination therapy. Potential indications could include MYD88-mutant Waldenström macroglobulinemia, subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and non-small cell lung cancer. This program is in an earlier stage of development.
 STAT3 Degrader for Cancer and Autoimmune/Fibrotic Diseases
 
Summary
 We are developing our selective STAT3 degraders for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors, as well as autoimmune diseases and fibrosis. STAT3 is a transcription factor activated through a variety of different cytokine and growth factor receptors via JAKs, as well as through oncogenic fusion proteins and mutations in STAT3 itself. We believe the diverse functions of STAT3 in tumor biology, evasion of immune surveillance by tumor cells, and inflammation and fibrosis provide opportunities to address a wide variety of high unmet need disease indications through the targeting of a single genetically and clinically validated pathway. While the JAK-STAT pathway has been partially addressed with several clinically successful JAK-targeting agents, we believe there are currently no drugs that specifically affect STAT3 broadly across all the relevant cell types. Small molecule STAT3 dimerization inhibitors targeting the SH2 domain have been in development, but significant challenges remain: first, homology of SH2 domains among all STAT family members impacts the ability to achieve specificity for STAT3, and second, inability to block dimerization independent transcriptional activities of STAT3. For these reasons, we believe that STAT3 degraders may provide a transformative solution to develop targeted and specific drugs to address multiple STAT3 dependent pathologies. In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory liquid and solid tumors, including aggressive lymphomas. We initiated the Phase 1 clinical study in January 2022.
 Biology and Mechanism of Action of STAT3 Degrader
 STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) is a transcription factor and a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT3 is phosphorylated by receptor-associated serine/threonine kinases, and phosphorylated STAT3, or p-STAT3, then forms dimers that translocate into the nucleus, bind to DNA, and regulate

transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in oncogenesis, inflammation and fibrosis. STAT3 is frequently mutated and activated in numerous cancers, including clinically aggressive hematologic malignancies with high unmet medical need. Mechanistically, aberrant activation of STAT3 has been directly linked to the promotion of cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. In addition, STAT3 regulates the crosstalk between tumor, stroma, and immune cells to promote an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. STAT3 activation by IL-6 and TGF-ß is also involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and fibrosis. These various roles of STAT3 in disease pathogenesis make it an attractive target for drug development in cancer and autoimmune and fibrotic diseases.
 Differentiation from JAK and IL-6 Inhibitors
 Small molecule inhibitors against JAK family kinases, such as JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, have been approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis and target the JAK2/STAT5 pathway. In oncology, JAK inhibitors have been approved for hematological malignancies with mutations leading to activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, including primary myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, and for acute graft versus host disease. JAK inhibitors block signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors and reduce activation not only of STAT3 but also STAT1 and STAT5 in response to these stimuli. For modulating anti-tumor effects, this broad activity may have conflicting consequences. In particular, the inhibition of STAT1 activity dampens anti-tumor immune responses by cytolytic T cells and antigen presenting cells, thereby counteracting a productive immune response that could be achieved by inhibition of STAT3 alone. As a result, JAK inhibitors have not shown clinical activity in cancer beyond the myeloproliferative neoplasms. The broad activity of JAK inhibitors is also associated with class-specific adverse effects. By targeting STAT3 selectively, these immunosuppressive and safety liabilities associated with broader STAT1 and STAT5 inhibition through JAK inhibition may be avoided while also effectively addressing JAK-dependent and independent activation of STAT3.
 Monoclonal antibodies directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 or their receptors IL-6R have also been approved for select autoimmune diseases. However, autoimmune and fibrotic diseases and certain cancers are often regulated by multiple cytokines. As such, targeting STAT3 has the potential to be more effective since it is involved in signaling by not just IL-6, but also by TGF-ß and cytokines such as IL-12, IL-2 and IL-15. Consequently, targeting STAT3 directly has the potential to block multiple signaling pathways that converge on STAT3 and reverse pathological processes that contribute to a tumor-permissive microenvironment.
 Development Opportunities
 The multiple effects of a STAT3 degrader on oncogenesis, tumor cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy, and evasion of immune surveillance provide multiple development opportunities in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Additionally, the role of STAT3 in chronic inflammation and fibrosis, as also observed in patients with germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations, informs opportunities in autoimmune and fibrotic diseases.
Hematologic Malignancies
 Oncogenic STAT3 mutations and/or STAT3 pathway activations are highly common in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. PTCL has an estimated prevalence of approximately 40,000 patients in the major global markets and CTCL has an estimated prevalence of approximately 100,000 patients across the major global markets. STAT3 mutations and pathway activations along with responsiveness of PTCL subsets and CTCL to immune checkpoint inhibitors point to a dependency on STAT3 in these indications and therefore the opportunity to develop a STAT3 degrader as a monotherapy. The standard of care for first-line treatment of PTCL is the combination of brentuximab vedotin, a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate, and chemotherapy. The majority of PTCL patients, including ALK-ALCL, PTCL-Not Otherwise Specified, AITL and NK/T lymphoma subtypes, eventually progress and die of their disease. For patients with refractory/relapsed disease, current treatment options are limited and approved therapies pralatrexate and romidepsin have shown limited efficacy. High prevalence of STAT3 mutations (approximately 13-38%) and STAT3 pathway activation (up to 90%) is found in these refractory/relapsed PTCL subsets with high unmet need. Given the documented effect of STAT3 downregulation on levels of programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, we expect our STAT3 degrader to have a dual effect in these patients. In CTCL patients with advanced stage disease and the highest levels of STAT3 activation, there are no curative therapies and no standard of care. Antibody-drug conjugates, HDAC inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have some activity and are used upfront or in refractory/relapsed patients, but there remains a high unmet need for an effective therapeutic with both tumor-intrinsic as well as immunomodulatory antitumor effects.
 STAT3 pathway activation is also present in virtually all patients with T- and NK-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and up to 70% of patients have oncogenic STAT3 mutations. These findings are highly indicative of STAT3 dependency, which is further supported by the preliminary clinical activity of JAK inhibitors in these patients. STAT3

activation is also commonly observed in AML and in DLBCL even though STAT3 mutations are infrequent. PD-L1 overexpression in DLBCL has been linked to worse disease outcomes and responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have been reported in these patients. Given STAT3 has downstream impact on PD-1/PD-L1, we believe that a STAT3 degrader has the potential to achieve profound clinical effects both as a monotherapy and in combination with other active drugs.
 Solid Tumors
 Cancers that are responsive to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or HNSCC, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, are compelling development opportunities due to the established role of STAT3 in solid tumor resistance to ICIs and TKIs. Specifically, STAT3 degraders have the potential to improve responses upfront in combination with these modalities or overcome acquired resistance as add-on therapy in second line.
Autoimmune and Fibrotic Diseases
 Patients with rare germline STAT3 gain-of-function mutations develop multiple autoimmune and fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis, or SSc, AD, interstitial lung disease, enteropathies, and RA. We believe these manifestations, and their response to JAK inhibitors, provide support for STAT3 degrader development in immunology and inflammation. There are numerous publications that highlight the role of STAT3-mediated IL-6 and TGF-ß signaling in the pathogenesis of SSc, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, Crohn’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. There remains a high unmet need for drugs that can target both the inflammation and fibrosis in SSc, IPF and other diseases that cause Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) and halt or reverse disease progression. A STAT3 degrader has the potential for this dual effect and could therefore provide a transformative approach to treating PF-ILD as well as Crohn’s disease and RA.
Preclinical Studies and Data
  Figure 31 shows the selectivity of our STAT3 degrader as evidenced by proteomic analysis demonstrating that at KT-333 concentrations 10-fold greater than the DC95, STAT3 is the only protein to be degraded among over 10,000 proteins evaluated including other closely related STAT family members.
Figure 31.
    


The in vivo activity of KT-333 is summarized in Figure 32, which shows weekly administration resulting in robust antitumor activity with full regressions that are durable in animals bearing STAT3-dependent T cell lymphomas. These regressions were associated with >90% STAT3 knockdown in tumors.
Figure 32.
 

   While KT-333 single agent leads to profound anti-tumor activity, based on the role of STAT3 in the tumor microenvironment, additional studies were undertaken to explore the potential immune effects of STAT3 degraders on tumors. Figure 33 summarizes results from a mouse syngeneic colorectal cancer model, in which a STAT3 degrader resulted in an IFN-gamma-dependent gene expression signature that has previously been identified as a predictor of response in cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab. These findings are consistent with STAT3’s role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment and provide the rationale for combining STAT3 degraders with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Figure 33.
 

As shown in Figure 34, a mouse syngeneic CT-26 colorectal cancer model, the addition of KT-333 augmented the activity of a PD-1 inhibitor in a syngeneic mouse model of colorectal cancer (CT-26), resulting in complete regressions in a majority of animals. Furthermore, in the combination group, there was no tumor growth when re-challenged one month after last dose, suggesting development of long-term immune memory. In addition to causing tumor regressions, the combination extended survival relative to either PD-1 inhibitor or STAT3 degrader alone. Collectively, we believe these data suggest that the addition of STAT3 degraders could significantly augment the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Figure 34.
 
   
Clinical Development Plans
 In November 2021, we announced that we received FDA clearance of our IND to evaluate our STAT3 degrader, KT-333, in a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b trial in adult patients with lymphomas, large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and solid tumors. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of KT-333 administered intravenously on a weekly regimen. Phase 1a is expected to enroll patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas, with an expansion into solid tumors at the MTD or RP2D. A Phase 1b expansion is planned to consist of separate cohorts of patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL, CTCL, and LGL-L and advanced solid tumors. Efficacy will be evaluated in all cohorts in Phase 1a and Phase 1b and exploratory endpoints will include pharmacodynamic assessments, including level of STAT3 knockdown and its downstream effects in peripheral blood and in tumors. Although KT-333 has robust single agent activity in preclinical models, we also plan to explore combining KT-333 with other agents used to treat PTCL or CTCL, as well as with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. As a result, subsequent to establishing the safety/tolerability, and PK of KT-333 monotherapy, the protocol may be amended to evaluate combinations with standard of care regimens in PTCL or CTCL and with standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors.
Autoimmunity
 The following figures summarize the results of multiple preclinical experiments demonstrating robust antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity of STAT3 degraders in mouse models of systemic scleroderma, arthritis, and CNS inflammation. In the Tight Skin model, shown in Figure 35, a spontaneous TGF beta dependent model of fibrosis that is representative of scleroderma, STAT3 degradation resulted in significant reduction in skin thickening and completely inhibited myofibroblast contraction in an in vitro gel contraction assay.
Figure 35.
 

   In the Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) model, which is a prototypical model of RA, as shown in Figure 36, STAT3 degradation reduced the clinical signs of disease in a dose dependent manner. The effect of STAT3 degrader is also reflected by the significant reduction in pathology scores and periosteal bone growth.
Figure 36.
 
   Figure 37 illustrates the effect of STAT3 degradation in the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (or EAE) model representative of MS. In this model STAT3 degradation not only had a profound effect on severity of disease but also greatly reduced the incidence of disease and delayed onset of encephalomyelitis in the animals.
   Figure 37.
       Collectively, these findings highlight the pleiotropic effects of STAT3 degraders in fibrosis and inflammation, demonstrating the potential for this approach across a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases.
    MDM2
 Summary
 MDM2 is the crucial regulator of the most common tumor suppressor, p53 which remains intact in more than 50% of cancers. We believe that our highly potent MDM2 degrader, unlike small molecule inhibitors, has the ability to suppress the MDM2 feedback loop and thereby rapidly induce robust p53 upregulation and apoptosis with brief exposures. Our MDM2 degrader has the potential to be effective in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors with functioning (wild type) p53. Our lead MDM2 candidate, KT-253, is currently in IND enabling studies, and we expect to file our IND in the second half of 2022.
Target Rational and Mechanism of Action
 MDM2 is the ligase which controls the tumor suppressor p53. Functional in over 50% of cancers, p53 is both liquid and solid, and many p53 functional cell lines are dependent on MDM2 overexpression for p53 suppression and survival. Stabilization and upregulation of p53 by removal of MDM2 by degradation can cause cells to undergo cell death and /or cell cycle arrest. While MDM2 small molecule inhibitors have shown clinical activity in a variety of tumor types, the activity has been limited as a result of the inhibition of MDM2 leading to a feedback loop, as shown in Figure 38. This feedback loop results in upregulation of MDM2 protein expression, which in turn makes it more difficult for occupancy-driven small molecules to inhibit MDM2. As a result, small molecule inhibitors have had a more modest effect on p53 upregulation which more often leads to cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis, thereby limiting efficacy. This feedback loop also necessitates more chronic exposure to drug to maintain modest MDM2 inhibition in tumors, leading to toxic effects on normal cells that limits the safety and tolerability of these inhibitors. Degraders have the potential to block the MDM2 feedback loop by completely removing the protein in a catalytic manner. This enables the development of highly potent drugs that are able to induce strong p53 upregulation and an irreversible acute apoptotic response in tumor cells with just brief exposures, thereby maximizing efficacy and improving the safety profile by allowing time for the recovery of normal cells.
Figure 38.
 

Preclinical Data
 KT253 is designed as a potent and selective degrader of MDM2. Figure 39 displays the sub-nanomolar potency of KT-253 as compared to a small molecule inhibitor currently in clinical trials.
Figure 39.
 

We observed increased p53 stabilization over small molecule inhibitors, as shown in Figure 40.


Figure 40.
 

As a result, we believe KT-253 has potential to have stark potency differences versus the inhibitors in cell killing assays in p53 wild type Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia , as shown in Figure 41.
Figure 41.
 

As shown in Figure 42, KT-253 is 200-fold more potent in the RS4-11 Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia cell line compared to what has been published, to date, on the most potent MDM2 small molecule in the clinic (DS-3032).
Figure 42.
 
   The potency of KT-253 relative to a MDM2 small molecule inhibitor is the result of its ability to suppress the feedback up-regulation of MDM2, as shown below in Figure 43.
Figure 43.
 

This mechanism of action enables the MDM2 degraders to be extremely efficient in triggering the acute apoptotic response with short exposures that we believe should provide a superior therapeutic index over small molecule inhibitors. Figure 44 shows washout experiments. With just 4 hours of coverage, KT-253 was observed to produce cell killing in this cell line, whereas the small molecule inhibitor was not.
Figure 44.
 
Figure 45 illustrates that with a single low dose at 1mg/kg, KT-253 induces PD markers of MDM2 inhibition, including brisk p53 upregulation and acute apoptotic readouts such as PUMA. This single low dose sends the established tumor model into deep regression for weeks, while also allowing time for recovery of any normal cells affected. Clinically equivalent exposures of small molecules have not been observed to have significant in vivo activity in this xenograft model.
Figure 45.
 


   Figure 46 illustrates MDM2 dependency is seen across a large subset of tumor types as shown on the left by genetically knocking out MDM2 across a panel of cell lines and on the right, showing effects on cell lines by pharmacologically removing MDM2 with a degrader. KT-253 shows marked superiority over the SMI DS-3032 in the panel of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), AML, DLBCL and Uveal melanoma cells.
Figure 46.
 

   Development Opportunities
 The large numbers of p53wt cell lines dependent on MDM2, as depicted in Figure 46 above on the left blue, gives a high-level view of the potential breadth of opportunities in oncology for a potent and well tolerated agent for this pathway. These tumor cell types include, but are not limited to cancers which have amplification and over expression of MDM2. De-stabilization of p53 by MDM2 enables cells to survive by blocking both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. While the opportunities are very diverse, we plan to focus our development efforts on tumors which are most susceptible to the acute apoptotic response elicited by our degraders, where we believe we will be able to achieve the greatest therapeutic index and efficacy. Our initial disease areas of interest are AML, Uveal melanoma and lymphomas, in addition to other indications where preclinically we see that MDM2 degradation leads to an acute apoptotic response predictive of clinical activity with intermittent dosing.
   Other Programs
 Our focus on key undrugged or inadequately drugged nodes within therapeutically validated pathways combined with the target and disease agnostic features of our PegasusTM platform gives us opportunity to develop new therapies across various therapeutic areas. We are taking advantage of our proprietary E3 Ligase Whole-Body Atlas on the differential expression profile of E3 ligases to pursue targets that can benefit from potentially tissue-restricted degradation as well as programs that can be enabled by novel molecular glue mechanisms. Our early pipeline includes programs in genetically defined oncology and immunology indications. Through our Vertex collaboration, we are engaged in the discovery of additional targets that are able to fully leverage our aforementioned capabilities and expand our impact across several diseases outside of oncology and immunology.
Collaborations
 
Collaboration Agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited
 On October 3, 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development Limited, or GSK, to jointly identify, research and conduct preclinical development of collaboration compounds against specified collaboration targets to identify drug candidates. We refer to this agreement as the GSK Agreement.
 Under the GSK Agreement, GSK is using its DNA-encoded libraries, which can be used to scan trillions of compounds tagged with DNA bar codes that can be sequenced to reveal the structure of any hits, to screen a limited number of drug discovery targets of interest. The GSK Agreement also provides that the parties will collaborate to discover novel ligase binders. The GSK Agreement supports ongoing collaboration between the parties, with each party having a right to use certain insights gained in the collaboration for its own programs. The GSK Agreement also provides a mechanism for GSK to negotiate to license certain collaboration programs.
 GSK has granted us a royalty-bearing, exclusive, non-transferrable, worldwide, sublicensable right and license to research, develop and commercialize certain compounds.
 As partial consideration for this agreement, we issued GSK 886,305 Series A preferred units of Kymera Therapeutics, LLC. In addition, low single-digit royalties would become payable by us to GSK on worldwide net sales in a given calendar year if a product comprising certain licensed compounds were to be commercialized. Royalties would be payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis for a period commencing upon the first commercial sale of any such product and continuing for ten (10) years thereafter.
 Unless earlier terminated, the GSK Agreement will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until there are no more royalty payments owed to GSK on any product under the agreement. Either party may terminate the GSK Agreement upon an uncured material breach, or upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party. The GSK Agreement may also be terminated by either party for convenience upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the other pa
 Master Collaboration Agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated
 On May 9, 2019, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Vertex, focused on the research and development of our small molecule targeted protein degraders against multiple targets in disease areas outside our core strategic focus. The collaboration leverages our expertise in targeted protein degradation and our PegasusTM platform as well as Vertex’s scientific, clinical, and regulatory capabilities to accelerate the development of medicines for people with serious diseases. We refer to this agreement as the Vertex Agreement.
 Under the terms of the Vertex Agreement, we conduct research activities in multiple targets pursuant to an agreed-upon research plan. Upon designation of a clinical development candidate, Vertex has the option to exclusively license molecules against the designated target. We are eligible to receive an aggregate of up to $170 million in potential payments per licensing product based upon the successful achievement of specified research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as option exercise payments, for up to six (6) programs optioned by Vertex for licensing as part of the collaboration. No milestones have been achieved to date under the Vertex Agreement.
 In addition, Vertex will pay low single-digit royalties on future net sales on any products that may result from the commercialization of the licensed molecules. Vertex’s royalty obligations are on a product-by-product and country-by-country

basis and are subject to certain reductions, including (i) in the event that the exploitation of a product is not covered by a valid claim with the licensed patent rights and (ii) in the event of third parties achieving specifically negotiated levels of competitive market share. Such royalty obligations will expire on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last patent which covers a product in such country, (b) the expiration of any exclusivity granted by a regulatory authority and (c) 10 years following the first commercial sale of a product in such country. No additional payments have been made by Vertex under the Vertex Agreement to date.
 As initial consideration for the collaboration, Vertex paid us $70 million upfront including an equity investment in us through the purchase of 3,059,695 shares of our Series B-1 preferred stock. In connection with its equity investment, Vertex holds certain rights to invest, in its sole discretion, in future private placements or public securities offerings by Kymera, on a pro rata basis and subject to certain conditions.
 Under the Vertex Agreement, the parties established a joint advisory committee, or JAC. The JAC will, among other responsibilities, review and oversee, certain strategic activities performed under the Vertex Agreement, including reviewing the research plan and budget for the research activities and reviewing the research activities performed by each party.
 The initial research term of the collaboration is four years, extendable for an additional one-year period upon mutual agreement by the parties and payment by Vertex of certain per-target fees.
 The Vertex Agreement may be terminated by Vertex either in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis, upon prior written notice to Kymera. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement upon the other party’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party. Kymera also has the right to terminate the agreement with respect to a certain target upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that Vertex ceases all research, development and commercialization activities related to such target for a certain period of time, provided that the cessation is not the result of events outside of Vertex’s control.
 Collaboration Agreement with Genzyme Corporation
 On July 7, 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Sanofi Agreement, with Genzyme Corporation, a subsidiary of Sanofi, to co-develop drug candidates directed to two biological targets. The Sanofi Agreement became effective during the third quarter of 2020.
 Under the Sanofi Agreement, Kymera grants to Sanofi a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain lead compounds generated during the collaboration directed against IRAK4 and one additional undisclosed target in an undisclosed field of use. Such license is exercisable on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis only after a specified milestone. For compounds directed against IRAK4, the field of use includes diagnosis, treatment, cure, mitigation or prevention of any diseases, disorders or conditions, excluding oncology and immune-oncology.
 Pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, with respect to both targets we are responsible for discovery and preclinical research and conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for at least one degrader directed against IRAK4 plus up to three back up degraders, the costs of which will be borne by us, except in certain circumstances. With respect to both targets, Sanofi is responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of product candidates after a specified development milestone occurs with respect to each collaboration candidate.
 In addition, pursuant to the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi will grant to us an exclusive option, or Opt-In Right, exercisable, at our sole discretion, on a collaboration target-by-collaboration target basis that will include the right to (i) fund 50% of the United States development costs for collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use and (ii) share equally in the net profits and net losses of commercializing collaboration products directed against such target in the applicable field of use in the United States. In addition, if we exercise our Opt-In Right, Sanofi will grant to us an exclusive option, applicable to each collaboration target, which upon exercise will allow us to conduct certain co-promotion activities in the field in the United States.
 In consideration for the exclusive licenses granted to Sanofi under the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi paid to us an upfront payment of $150.0 million. In addition to the upfront payment, we will also be eligible to receive certain development milestone payments of up to $1.48 billion in the aggregate, of which more than $1.0 billion relates to the IRAK4 program, upon the achievement of certain developmental or regulatory events. We will also be eligible to receive certain commercial milestone payments up to $700.0 million in the aggregate, of which $400.0 million relates to the IRAK4 program, which are payable upon the achievement of certain net sales thresholds. We will further be eligible to receive tiered royalties for each program on

net sales ranging from the high single digits to high teens, subject to low-single digits upward adjustments in certain circumstances.
 The Sanofi Agreement, unless earlier terminated, will expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of expiration of all payment obligations under the Sanofi Agreement with respect to such product. We or Sanofi may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach or insolvency or for certain patent challenges. In addition, Sanofi may terminate the agreement for convenience or for a material safety event upon advance prior written notice, and we may terminate the agreement with respect to any collaboration candidate if, following Sanofi’s assumption of responsibility for the development, commercialization or manufacturing of collaboration candidates with respect to a particular target, Sanofi ceases to exploit any collaboration candidates directed to such target for a specified period.
 Manufacturing / Supply Chain
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our drug candidates and currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently engage with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical studies, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the production of both drug substance and finished drug product. We have engaged third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substances for our drug candidates and a third-party manufacturer to develop and manufacture finished drug product for KT-474 that we are using in our Phase 1 clinical trial. We currently obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Should any of these manufacturers become unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we may incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements.
 All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules, but which are larger than traditional small molecule therapeutics. We have selected these compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety, but also because we anticipate an ease of synthesis and cost of goods. We have produced drug substances and drug product for use in our KT-474 Phase 1 clinical trial and continue to refine our production processes. The drug substance and drug product processes are amenable to scale-up and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. To adequately meet our needs for late-stage clinical and commercial manufacturing, our suppliers will need to scale their production, or we will need to secure alternate suppliers.
 Competition
 The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our years of expertise in targeted protein degradation, clinical development expertise, and intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use targeted protein degradation or targeted protein degradation development platforms, and from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academia.
 Competitors in our efforts to develop small molecule protein degraders therapies for patients, include, but are not limited to, Arvinas, Inc., C4 Therapeutics, Inc., Nurix Therapeutics, Inc., and Foghorn Therapeutics, Inc. Further, several large pharmaceutical companies have disclosed preclinical investments in this field. Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other targeted protein degradation methods as well as small molecule, antibody, or gene therapies for the same indications that we are targeting. In addition to the competitors we face in developing small molecule protein degraders, we will also face competition in the indications we expect to pursue with our IRAK4, IRAKIMiD, STAT3, and MDM2 programs. Many of these indications already have approved standards of care which may include more traditional therapeutic modalities. In order to compete effectively with these existing therapies, we will need to demonstrate that our protein degrader therapies are favorable to existing therapeutics.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to secure intellectual property protection for our product candidates and future products, as well as our platform protein degradation technologies and any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to our business. Our success also depends on our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our proprietary information, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.


As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, future products, and other proprietary technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent coverage and enforcing those patents if granted. However, we cannot guarantee that our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file, will result in the issuance of patents, or that any issued patents we may obtain will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any issued patents that we obtain may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties.
 In addition to patents, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and potential collaborators.
 Patent Portfolio
 Our intellectual property includes a portfolio of wholly owned patent families covering our platform E3 ligase ligand technology and our novel bifunctional degrader product candidates, including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, methods of treatment, and other related compounds and methods. Our intellectual property portfolio is in its very early stages, and, as of January 21, 2022, included two granted U.S. patents, about 40 U.S. patent applications, and about 130 foreign patent applications. Our patent portfolio is generally organized into two categories: (1) platform E3 ligase ligand patent families and (2) protein degrader patent families, including various target-specific degrader patent families.
Platform E3 Ligase Ligand Patent Families
 Our platform E3 ligase ligand patent families are wholly owned and include four patent families directed to novel ligands for the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase, as well as methods of treatment and other related methods. As of January 21, 2022, our platform E3 ligase ligand patent families included four U.S. patent applications and four foreign patent applications, including one international patent application and three patent applications in Europe. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from these applications, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Protein Degrader Patent Families
 Our protein degrader patent families are wholly owned and are directed to novel bifunctional degrader compounds that are useful in affecting ubiquitination of a target protein, as well as methods of treatment and other related methods. As of January 21, 2022, our protein degrader patent families included four U.S. patent applications and about 10 foreign patent applications, including one international patent application and patent applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from these applications, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Target-Specific Degrader Patent Families
 Our target-specific degrader patent families are wholly owned and focus protection around degrader compounds that are designed to target specific proteins for degradation, as well as methods of treatment and other related methods. Such targets include, for example, IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases) and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription). As of January 21, 2022, our target-specific degrader patent families included two granted U.S. patents, about 30 U.S. patent applications and about 110 foreign patent applications, including about 20 international patent applications and patent applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from our target-specific degrader patent families, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
IRAK-Specific Patent Families
 Our IRAK-specific patent families are wholly owned and include patent families covering degrader compounds that are designed to specifically target IRAK for degradation and patent families covering novel IRAK ligands. As of January 21, 2022, our IRAK-specific patent families included two granted U.S. patents, about 10 U.S. patent applications, about 10 international patent applications, and about 70 patent applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Gulf Cooperation Council, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and

Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from our IRAK-specific patent families, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to the KT-474 product candidate, as of January 21, 2022, we own one granted U.S. patent, seven pending U.S. patent applications, two pending international patent applications, and patent applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, such as Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Taiwan, each with claims directed to compositions of matter covering KT-474 and/or methods of making or using KT-474. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from these patent families, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2039 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 STAT-Specific Patent Families
 Our STAT-specific patent families are wholly owned and focus on degrader compounds that are designed to specifically target signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) for degradation. As of January 21, 2022, our STAT-specific patent families included three U.S. patent applications, two international patent applications, and about 20 patent applications filed in foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from our STAT-specific patent families, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2040 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Other Target-Specific Patent Families
 As of January 21, 2022, we own about 10 U.S. patent applications and about 10 foreign patent applications, including 5 international patent applications and patent applications filed in Argentina, Gulf Cooperation Council, and Taiwan, which focus on degrader compounds designed to specifically target other proteins. Any U.S. or foreign patents resulting from these patent families, if granted and all appropriate maintenance fees paid, are expected to expire between 2040 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In certain cases, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, though the total patent term, including any extension, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. A patent can only be extended once, such that, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product.
 The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective national filing date.
 Similar patent term extension provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent covering an approved drug. When possible, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
 Trademarks
 We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our product candidates and other technologies in various jurisdictions, including the United States.
We have applied to register both the KYMERA mark and the KYMERA THERAPEUTICS mark in the United States, Europe, and Canada. We also filed applications in the same jurisdictions for the mark IRAKIMiD, for pharmaceutical and medical preparations and therapeutics, as well as diagnostic reagents, for the treatment of oncology, autoimmune, immune-oncology and other related diseases. In addition, we filed applications for E3 HUMAN ATLAS and E3 LIGASE WHOLE BODY ATLAS in connection with pharmaceutical research and development and drug development and discovery services. All of our European Union trademarks in existence as of December 31, 2020 were automatically cloned onto the United Kingdom register due to “Brexit.”
Most recently, we filed an application for our K & Design mark in the United States, and we plan to file European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada applications based on our U.S. priority date in that application in due course.
Government Regulation
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety,

effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 The process required by the FDA before our product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
 •completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a NDA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
 
Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials for Drugs
 Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research patients will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the

hold and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
 •Phase —Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase —Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
 •Phase —Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.
 In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS program could include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk-minimization tools.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.


Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
 A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below.
 In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review.


Additionally, products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process
 
Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial or of multiple pediatric trials in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such trials.
 
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, tracking and tracing, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers and individuals working on behalf of manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.


In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or withdrawal of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
 
Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 Companion diagnostics identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the U.S., the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
 A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually

contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
 Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and our facilities for compliance with its authorities.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the U.S. in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
 
Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement

In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates that:

•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 •addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 


•expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administrations or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended these reductions from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022 . In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, including bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the current administration’s budgets for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 contained further drug price control measures that could be enacted in future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the current administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Additionally, in the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, contains provisions that call for the promulgation of regulations that expand pharmacists’ and wholesalers’ ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. Further, the MMA provides that these changes to U.S. importation laws will not take effect, unless and until the Secretary of the HHS certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public’s health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. On September 23, 2020, the Secretary of the HHS made such certification to Congress, and on October 1, 2020, FDA published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. Under the final rule, States and Indian Tribes, and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers, may submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. Since the issuance of the final rule, several industry groups have filed federal lawsuits challenging multiple

aspects of the final rule, and authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by States under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. Separately, the FDA also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code, or NDC, for an FDA-approved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country. The market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time. Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.

Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; changing legal requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which we may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject firms to legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention

from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional recordkeeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.

Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

Government Regulation of Drugs Outside of the United States
  To market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area, or the EEA (comprised of the EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized procedure or a national procedure.
    •Centralized procedure—If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicinal products. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 •National procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:


oDecentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 oMutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU country, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
    Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain authorizations on January, 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In the EU a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no MAA shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same therapeutic indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the

EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 Similar to as in the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States, meaning no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union.
 The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the “Clinical Trials Information System” or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by coordinated assessment by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) following review by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
    Government regulation of data collection outside of the United States
   In the event we conduct clinical trials in the European Union, we will be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA to the extent they process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenues for the preceding financial year, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional controls and processes ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. There has been limited enforcement of the GDPR to date, particularly in biopharmaceutical development, so

we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on any future trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. In addition, further to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020, but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing.
 There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with the GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EEA, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Should we utilize third party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
   Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
 
Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 141 full-time employees, of which 73 have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 108 employees are engaged in research and development and 33 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. Our workforce expanded during FY21; new employees were hired to support and extend our clinical and preclinical pipeline, with hires in commercial, clinical development and operations, research, manufacturing, and general and administrative functions. We expect to continue to add additional employees in 2022 with a focus on expanding increasing expertise and bandwidth in clinical and preclinical research and development. We continually evaluate the business need and opportunity and balance in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantially all clinical trial work to clinical research organizations and certain drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers. Drug development is a complex endeavor which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Pharmaceutical companies, both large and small, compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. We monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for all our employees, as well as participation in our equity programs. To attract qualified applicants, the Company offers a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation for every employee. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance.
 None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.


We support our employees’ further development with individualized development plans, mentoring, coaching, group training, conference attendance and financial support including tuition reimbursement.
 Response to COVID-19
 Beginning in March 2020, we have supported our employees and government efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic through a multifaceted communication, infrastructure, and behavior modification and enforcement effort:
    •Establishing clear and regular COVID-19 policies, safety protocols, and updates to all employees;
 •Decreasing density and increasing physical distancing in workspaces for employees working onsite by scheduling adjustments and adding work from home flexibility;
 •Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
 •Increasing cleaning protocols at our Watertown, MA headquarters;
 •Providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
 •Implementing weekly COVID-19 testing;
 •Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
 •Prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees;
 •Requiring masks to be worn in all locations.
 
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Watertown, Massachusetts, where we lease and occupy approximately 34,522 square feet of office and laboratory space. The current term of our Watertown lease expires March 31, 2030, with an option to extend the term five additional years with 12 months’ notice with rent set at an agreed upon market rate.
 Our existing facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs. To meet the future needs of our business, we may lease additional or alternate space, and we believe suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
 On December 20, 2021, we entered into a noncancelable lease for 100,624 square feet of office and laboratory space in Watertown, Massachusetts. This lease has an initial term of 134 months, and we have two consecutive options to extend the term of the lease for five years each at then-market rates.
