General
We are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with an emphasis on oil and natural gas shale and other unconventional plays. Our current operations are focused primarily on the oil and liquids-rich portion of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We also operate in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana. Additionally, we conduct midstream operations, primarily through our midstream joint venture, San Mateo, in support of our exploration, development and production operations and provide natural gas processing, oil transportation services, oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services and produced water disposal services to third parties.
We are a Texas corporation founded in July 2003 by Joseph Wm. Foran, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Foran began his career as an oil and natural gas independent in 1983 when he founded Foran Oil Company with $270,000 in contributed capital from 17 friends and family members. Foran Oil Company was later contributed to Matador Petroleum Corporation upon its formation by Mr. Foran in 1988. Mr. Foran served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of that company from its inception until it was sold in June 2003 to Tom Brown, Inc., in an all cash transaction for an enterprise value of approximately $388.5 million.
On February 2, 2012, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “MTDR.” Prior to trading on the NYSE, there was no established public trading market for our common stock. 
Our goal is to increase shareholder value by building oil and natural gas reserves, production and cash flows and providing midstream services at an attractive rate of return on invested capital. We plan to achieve our goal by, among other items, executing the following business strategies:
•focus our exploration and development activities primarily on unconventional plays, including the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin;
•identify, evaluate and develop additional oil and natural gas plays as necessary to maintain a balanced portfolio of oil and natural gas properties;
•continue to improve operational and cost efficiencies;
•identify and develop midstream opportunities that support and enhance our exploration and development activities and that generate value for San Mateo;
•maintain our financial discipline;
•return capital to shareholders through our dividend policy;
•pursue opportunistic acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures; and
•provide the energy that society needs and do so in a manner that is safe, protects the environment and is consistent with the oil and natural gas industry’s best practices.
Despite the precipitous decline in global oil demand resulting from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 in 2020, which led to a very challenging oil and natural gas price environment, global oil demand and oil and natural gas prices improved significantly during 2021. These factors, along with the successful execution of our business strategies, led to increases in our oil and natural gas production and proved oil and natural gas reserves in 2021, as well as to increases in our oil and natural gas revenues and cash flows. We also improved the capital efficiency of our drilling and completion operations and achieved several key operational milestones throughout the year (as further described below in “—Exploration and Production Segment—Southeast New Mexico and West Texas—Delaware Basin”). In addition, we achieved several key capital resources objectives during the year, including generating free cash flow, paying down borrowings, initiating and increasing a quarterly cash dividend and earning performance incentives from Five Point. Further, we concluded several important financing transactions in 2021, including extending the maturity of and significantly increasing the borrowing base under our Credit Agreement (as defined below) and increasing the lender commitments under the San Mateo Credit Facility (as defined below). San Mateo also achieved several important milestones in 2021, including the addition of produced water disposal capacity and being awarded several new customer contracts. These achievements and transactions increased our operational flexibility and opportunities while preserving the strength of our balance sheet and our liquidity position.
2021 Highlights
Increased Oil, Natural Gas and Oil Equivalent Production
For the year ended December 31, 2021, we achieved record oil, natural gas and average daily oil equivalent production. In 2021, we produced 17.8 million Bbl of oil, an increase of 12%, as compared to 15.9 million Bbl of oil produced in 2020. We also produced 81.7 Bcf of natural gas, an increase of 18% from 69.5 Bcf of natural gas produced in 2020. Our average daily oil equivalent production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 86,176 BOE per day, including 48,876 Bbl of oil per day and 223.8 MMcf of natural gas per day, an increase of 15%, as compared to 75,175 BOE per day, including 43,526 Bbl of oil per day and 189.9 MMcf of natural gas per day, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in oil and natural gas production was primarily attributable to our ongoing delineation and development drilling activities in the Delaware Basin throughout 2021, which offset declining production in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales. Oil production comprised 57% of our total production (using a conversion ratio of one Bbl of oil per six Mcf of natural gas) for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 58% in 2020. 
Increased Oil, Natural Gas and Oil Equivalent Reserves
At December 31, 2021, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves were 323.4 million BOE, including 181.3 million Bbl of oil and 852.5 Bcf of natural gas, an increase of 20% from 270.3 million BOE, including 159.9 million Bbl of oil and 662.3 Bcf of natural gas, at December 31, 2020. The Standardized Measure of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 176% from $1.58 billion at December 31, 2020 to $4.38 billion at December 31, 2021. The PV-10 of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 223% from $1.66 billion at December 31, 2020 to $5.35 billion at December 31, 2021. The increases in our Standardized Measure and PV-10 were primarily a result of the significantly higher weighted average oil and natural gas prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, but also due to the 20% increase in our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure, see “—Estimated Proved Reserves.”
At December 31, 2021, proved developed reserves included 102.2 million Bbl of oil and 546.2 Bcf of natural gas, and proved undeveloped reserves included 79.1 million Bbl of oil and 306.4 Bcf of natural gas. Proved developed reserves and proved oil reserves comprised 60% and 56%, respectively, of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021. Proved developed reserves and proved oil reserves comprised 46% and 59%, respectively, of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020. The improvement in proved developed reserves as a percentage of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves to 60% at December 31, 2021 from 46% at December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the development and conversion of approximately 40.1 million BOE of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in the Delaware Basin in 2021.
Operational Highlights
We focus on optimizing the development of our resource base by seeking ways to maximize our recovery per well relative to the cost incurred and to minimize our operating costs per BOE produced. We apply an analytical approach to track and monitor the effectiveness of our drilling and completion techniques and service providers. This allows us to better manage 
operating costs, the pace of development activities, technical applications, the gathering and marketing of our production and capital allocation. Additionally, we concentrate on our core areas, which allows us to achieve economies of scale and reduce operating costs. Largely as a result of these factors, we believe that we have increased our technical knowledge of drilling, completing and producing Delaware Basin wells. We expect the Delaware Basin will continue to be our primary area of focus in 2022.
We completed and began producing oil and natural gas from 97 gross (48.2 net) wells in the Delaware Basin in 2021, including 47 gross (44.2 net) operated and 50 gross (4.0 net) non-operated wells. At December 31, 2021, our total acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately 237,200 gross (124,800 net) acres, primarily in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas. We have focused our Delaware Basin operations on the following asset areas: the Stateline, Rustler Breaks and Arrowhead asset areas in Eddy County, New Mexico and the Antelope Ridge, Ranger and Twin Lakes asset areas in Lea County, New Mexico and the Wolf and Jackson Trust asset areas in Loving County, Texas. Our Delaware Basin properties are the most significant component of our asset portfolio. Our average daily oil equivalent production from the Delaware Basin increased approximately 19% to 80,534 BOE per day (93% of total oil equivalent production), including 47,339 Bbl of oil per day (97% of total oil production) and 199.2 MMcf of natural gas per day (89% of total natural gas production), in 2021, as compared to 67,522 BOE per day (90% of total oil equivalent production), including 41,678 Bbl of oil per day (96% of total oil production) and 155.1 MMcf of natural gas per day (82% of total natural gas production), in 2020. We expect our Delaware Basin production to increase in 2022 as we continue the delineation and development of these asset areas.
During 2021, we achieved all five significant and important operational milestones in the Delaware Basin we set at the beginning of the year. These five operational milestones (as further described below in “—Exploration and Production Segment—Southeast New Mexico and West Texas—Delaware Basin”) were each achieved when we turned to sales:
•the second group of Rodney Robinson wells in the western portion of our Antelope Ridge asset area, in March 2021; these four Rodney Robinson wells have produced in aggregate approximately 1.5 million BOE in 11 months of production;
•the first 13 Voni wells, all of which were 2.3-mile laterals, in the western portion of the Stateline asset area in a staggered fashion during April and May 2021; these 13 Voni wells have produced in aggregate approximately 5.2 million BOE in eight months of production;
•four wells in the Stebbins area and surrounding leaseholds in the southern portion of the Arrowhead asset area (the “Greater Stebbins Area”) in July 2021; these four wells have produced in aggregate approximately 0.7 million BOE in seven months of production;
•the second group of 13 Boros wells in the eastern portion of the Stateline asset area in a staggered fashion at various times primarily throughout September 2021; these 13 Boros wells have produced in aggregate approximately 2.2 million BOE in five months of production; and
•nine additional wells in the Greater Stebbins Area in December 2021.
In addition to achieving these five key operational milestones, further operational highlights in the Delaware Basin (as further described below in “—Exploration and Production Segment—Southeast New Mexico and West Texas—Delaware Basin”) in 2021 included:
•the fully realized transition to drilling longer laterals, whereby 98% of the operated horizontal wells we turned to sales in 2021 had lateral lengths of two miles or greater, as compared to 74% in 2020, 8% in 2019 and only one two-mile lateral in 2018;
•the continuing improvement in capital efficiency as demonstrated by our average drilling and completion costs for all operated horizontal wells turned to sales of approximately $670 per lateral foot in 2021, a decrease of 21% as compared to $850 per lateral foot in 2020, a decrease of 42% as compared to average drilling and completion costs of $1,165 per lateral foot in 2019 and a decrease of 56% as compared to average drilling and completion costs of $1,528 per lateral foot in 2018; 
•capital expenditures for drilling, completing and equipping wells (“D/C/E capital expenditures”) for 2021 of $513 million, which was below our original estimated range for 2021 D/C/E capital expenditures of $525 to $575 million as provided on February 23, 2021 and our revised estimated range for 2021 D/C/E capital expenditures of $535 to $565 million as provided on October 26, 2021, despite the acceleration of 11 Voni well completions forward into the fourth quarter of 2021 and the addition of a fifth operated drilling rig;
•record-low annual unit operating costs for lease operating expenses of $3.46 per BOE; 
•general and administrative expenses of $3.06 per BOE, which were the second lowest general and administrative expenses we have achieved on an annual basis, as compared to a record low $2.27 per BOE in 2020. These 2021 general and administrative expenses were achieved despite the impact of increased cash-settled stock compensation costs and the reinstatement of employee compensation beginning in March 2021, which had been previously reduced beginning in March 2020 in response to the significantly lower oil and natural gas price environment at that time.
Capital Resources and Financing Highlights
During 2021, we achieved several significant and important capital resources objectives we set at the beginning of the year. These objectives included:
•the generation of free cash flow in all four quarters of 2021;
•the net repayment of $340.0 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility, resulting in outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million at December 31, 2021;
•the adoption of a dividend policy in the first quarter of 2021 pursuant to which we initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share of common stock and the subsequent amendment of that dividend policy in the fourth quarter of 2021, pursuant to which we doubled the quarterly cash dividend to $0.05 per share of common stock; and
•the receipt of $48.6 million in performance incentives directly from Five Point;
In addition, we concluded several important financing transactions in 2021 that increased our operational flexibility and opportunities, while preserving the strength of our balance sheet and improving our liquidity position. These transactions included: 
•the closing of our fourth amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) in November 2021 to (i) extend the maturity date by three years to October 31, 2026 from October 31, 2023 previously, (ii) increase the borrowing base by 50% to $1.35 billion, as compared to $900.0 million previously, (iii) reaffirm the elected borrowing commitment at $700.0 million, (iv) reaffirm the maximum facility amount at $1.5 billion and (v) add three new banks to our lending group; and
•the amendment of San Mateo’s revolving credit facility (the “San Mateo Credit Facility”) in June 2021 to increase the lender commitments under the revolving credit facility to $450.0 million from $375.0 million and an accordion feature that provides for potential increases in lender commitments to up to $700.0 million.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information regarding these financing transactions. 
Midstream Highlights
San Mateo achieved strong operating results in 2021, highlighted by (i) free cash flow generation, (ii) increased midstream services revenues and (iii) increased natural gas gathering and processing volumes, produced water handling volumes and oil gathering and transportation volumes, all as compared to 2020. Volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 do not include the full quantity of volumes that would have otherwise been delivered by certain San Mateo customers subject to minimum volume commitments (although partial deliveries were made in both years), but for which San Mateo recognized revenues. San Mateo is owned 51% by us and 49% by our joint venture partner, Five Point. 
During 2021, San Mateo closed seven new midstream transactions with oil and natural gas producers and other counterparties in Eddy County, New Mexico, which are expected to generate additional natural gas gathering and processing, oil gathering and transportation and water handling volumes in future periods. A majority of these new opportunities reflect additional business awarded to San Mateo by existing customers, which we believe is indicative of the quality of service San Mateo provides to all of its customers in the Delaware Basin. For example, San Mateo was able to keep its gathering, processing and disposal systems operational throughout the historically prolonged cold weather conditions experienced in New Mexico and Texas during Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. 
At December 31, 2021, San Mateo’s midstream system included: 
•Natural Gas Assets: 460 MMcf per day of designed natural gas cryogenic processing capacity in San Mateo’s cryogenic natural gas processing plant in Eddy County, New Mexico (the “Black River Processing Plant”) and approximately 150 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas, including 43 miles of large-diameter natural gas gathering lines spanning from the Stateline asset area to the Greater Stebbins Area in Eddy County, New Mexico; 
•Oil Assets: Three oil central delivery points (“CDP”) with over 100,000 Bbl of designed oil throughput capacity and approximately 90 miles of oil gathering and transportation pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas, as well as a 400,000-acre joint development area with Plains Marketing, L.P. (“Plains”) to gather our and other producers’ oil production in Eddy County, New Mexico; and 
•Produced Water Assets: 14 commercial salt water disposal wells and associated facilities with designed produced water disposal capacity of 370,000 Bbl per day and approximately 130 miles of produced water gathering pipelines in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
We maintain an active ESG program and continued working in 2021 to improve upon our various ESG efforts. In May 2021, we published sustainability metrics aligned with standards developed by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”), which we subsequently updated in July 2021. In December 2021, we issued our inaugural Sustainability Report highlighting the results of our 2020 ESG progress and achievements.
In 2020, we grew gross operated oil production by 13% and gross operated natural gas production by 19%, as compared to 2019, while still reducing our environmental impact and continuing our strong safety record. Highlights from our 2020 ESG initiatives include: 
•Decreased emissions intensity by 19% and flaring intensity by 38%, as compared to 2019;
•Decreased consumption of fresh water by 49%, as compared to 2019; 
•Transported 96% of operated produced water and 65% of operated produced oil by pipeline; 
•Incurred no employee lost time incidents during more than 2.1 million employee man-hours from 2017 to 2020; 
•Provided approximately 15,000 hours of employee continuing education, equating to approximately 55 hours per employee; and 
•Revised the mandate of the Board of Directors’ Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Committee to enhance the focus, oversight and support for our ESG efforts and to measure improvements.
Exploration and Production Segment 
Our current operations are focused primarily on the oil and liquids-rich portion of the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. We also operate in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas and the Haynesville shale and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana. During 2021, we devoted most of our efforts and most of our capital expenditures to our drilling and completion operations in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays in the Delaware Basin, as well as our midstream operations there. Since our inception, our exploration and development efforts have concentrated primarily on known hydrocarbon-producing basins with well-established production histories offering the potential for multiple-zone completions. 
The following table presents certain summary data for each of our operating areas as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.

(1)Identified and engineered drilling locations. These locations have been identified for potential future drilling and were not producing at December 31, 2021. The total net engineered drilling locations are calculated by multiplying the gross engineered drilling locations in an operating area by our working interest participation in such locations. Individual horizontal drilling locations generally represent a variety of lateral lengths, from one mile to greater than two miles, based upon our current assumptions for a well that could be drilled at that location given our current acreage position. At December 31, 2021, approximately two-thirds of these identified drilling locations were expected to be horizontal laterals with lateral lengths of approximately two miles or greater, and approximately 80% are expected to have lateral lengths of approximately 1.5 miles or greater. At December 31, 2021, these engineered drilling locations included 358 gross (136 net) operated and non-operated locations to which we have assigned proved undeveloped reserves, primarily in the Wolfcamp or Bone Spring plays, but also in the Brushy Canyon, Avalon and Delaware formations, in the Delaware Basin and only eight gross (0.4 net) locations to which we have assigned proved undeveloped reserves in the Haynesville shale. At December 31, 2021, we had assigned no proved undeveloped reserves to our leasehold in the Eagle Ford shale.
(2)These estimates were prepared by our engineering staff and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent reservoir engineers. For additional information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves, see “—Estimated Proved Reserves” and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures included in the unaudited supplementary information in this Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(3)Production volumes and proved reserves reported in two streams: oil and natural gas, including both dry and liquids-rich natural gas. Estimated using a conversion ratio of one Bbl of oil per six Mcf of natural gas.
(4)Includes potential future engineered drilling locations in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, Brushy Canyon and Avalon plays on our acreage in the Delaware Basin at December 31, 2021. 
(5)Includes one well producing oil from the Austin Chalk formation in La Salle County, Texas and two wells producing small quantities of natural gas from the San Miguel formation in Zavala County, Texas. In January 2022, the two wells and associated acreage in Zavala County, Texas, which included 55 gross (55 net) engineered locations, were divested.
(6)Includes the Cotton Valley formation and shallower zones and also includes one well producing from the Frio formation in Orange County, Texas.
(7)Some of the same leases cover the net acres shown for both the Haynesville formation and the shallower Cotton Valley formation. Therefore, the sum of the net acreage for both formations is not equal to the total net acreage for Northwest Louisiana. This total includes acreage that we are producing from or that we believe to be prospective for these formations.
We are active both as an operator and as a non-operating co-working interest owner with various industry participants. At December 31, 2021, we operated a significant majority of our acreage in the Delaware Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. In those wells where we are not the operator, our working interests are often relatively small. At December 31, 2021, we also were the operator for almost all of our Eagle Ford acreage and approximately half of our Haynesville acreage.
While we do not always have direct access to our operating partners’ drilling plans with respect to future well locations on non-operated properties, we do attempt to maintain ongoing communications with the technical staff of these operators in an effort to understand their drilling plans for purposes of our capital expenditure budget and our booking of related proved undeveloped well locations and reserves. We review these locations with Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent reservoir engineers, on a periodic basis to ensure their concurrence with our estimates of these drilling plans and our approach to booking these reserves.
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas — Delaware Basin
The greater Permian Basin in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas is a mature exploration and production region with extensive developments in a wide variety of petroleum systems resulting in stacked target horizons in many areas. Historically, the majority of development in this basin has focused on relatively conventional reservoir targets, but, in recent years, the combination of advanced formation evaluation, 3-D seismic technology, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology is enhancing the development potential of this basin, particularly in the organic rich shales, or source rocks, of the Wolfcamp formation and in the low permeability sand and carbonate reservoirs of the Bone Spring, Avalon and Delaware formations. 
In the western part of the Permian Basin, also known as the Delaware Basin, the Lower Permian age Bone Spring (also called the Leonardian) and Wolfcamp formations are several thousand feet thick and contain stacked layers of shales, sandstones, limestones and dolomites. These intervals represent a complex and dynamic submarine depositional system that also includes organic rich shales that are the source rocks for oil and natural gas produced in the basin. Historically, production has come from conventional reservoirs; however, we and other industry players have realized that the source rocks also have sufficient porosity and permeability to be commercial reservoirs. In addition, the source rocks are interbedded with reservoir layers that have filled with hydrocarbons, both of which can produce significant volumes of oil and natural gas when connected by horizontal wellbores with multi-stage hydraulic fracture treatments. Particularly in the Delaware Basin, there are multiple horizontal targets in a given area that exist within the several thousand feet of hydrocarbon bearing layers that make up the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp plays. Multiple horizontal drilling and completion targets are being identified and targeted by companies, including us, throughout the vertical section, including the Brushy Canyon, Avalon, Bone Spring (First, Second and Third Sand and Carbonate) and several intervals within the Wolfcamp shale, often identified as Wolfcamp A through D.
At December 31, 2021, our total acreage position in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas was approximately 237,200 gross (124,800 net) acres, primarily in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas. These acreage totals included approximately 39,700 gross (22,600 net) acres in our Ranger asset area in Lea County, 64,500 gross (26,000 net) acres in our Arrowhead asset area in Eddy County, 47,500 gross (25,900 net) acres in our Rustler Breaks asset area in Eddy County, 24,700 gross (15,700 net) acres in our Antelope Ridge asset area in Lea County, 14,400 gross (10,700 net) acres in our Wolf and Jackson Trust asset areas in Loving County, 2,900 gross (2,900 net) acres in our Stateline asset area in Eddy County and 42,900 gross (20,500 net) acres in our Twin Lakes asset area in Lea County at December 31, 2021. We consider the vast majority of our Delaware Basin acreage position to be prospective for oil and liquids-rich targets in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations. Other potential targets on certain portions of our acreage include the Avalon and Delaware formations, as well as the Abo, Strawn, Devonian, Penn Shale, Atoka and Morrow formations. At December 31, 2021, our acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately 75% held by existing production. Excluding the Twin Lakes asset area, where at December 31, 2021 we had drilled only three vertical operated wells and two horizontal operated wells, and the undeveloped acreage acquired in the Bureau of Land Management New Mexico Oil and Gas Lease Sale on September 5 and 6, 2018 (the “BLM Acquisition”), which has 10-year leases with favorable lease-holding provisions, our acreage position in the Delaware Basin was approximately 86% held by existing production at December 31, 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued the delineation and development of our Delaware Basin acreage. We completed and began producing oil and natural gas from 97 gross (48.2 net) wells in the Delaware Basin, including 47 
gross (44.2 net) operated horizontal wells and 50 gross (4.0 net) non-operated horizontal wells, throughout our various asset areas. At December 31, 2021, we had tested a number of different producing horizons at various locations across our acreage position, including the Brushy Canyon, two benches of the Avalon, two benches of the First Bone Spring, two benches of the Second Bone Spring, two benches of the Third Bone Spring, three benches of the Wolfcamp A, including the X and Y sands and the more organic, lower section of the Wolfcamp A, three benches of the Wolfcamp B, the Wolfcamp D, the Morrow and the Strawn. Most of our delineation and development efforts have been focused on multiple completion targets between the First Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp B.
As a result of our ongoing drilling and completion operations in these asset areas, our Delaware Basin production increased significantly in 2021. Our average daily oil equivalent production from the Delaware Basin increased approximately 19% to 80,534 BOE per day (93% of total oil equivalent production), including 47,339 Bbl of oil per day (97% of total oil production) and 199.2 MMcf of natural gas per day (89% of total natural gas production), in 2021, as compared to 67,522 BOE per day (90% of total oil equivalent production), including 41,678 Bbl of oil per day (96% of total oil production) and 155.1 MMcf of natural gas per day (82% of total natural gas production), in 2020. 
At December 31, 2021, approximately 96% of our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, or 312.0 million BOE, was attributable to the Delaware Basin, including approximately 177.1 million Bbl of oil and 809.3 Bcf of natural gas, a 19% increase, as compared to 261.9 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Delaware Basin proved reserves at December 31, 2021 comprised approximately 98% of our proved oil reserves and 95% of our proved natural gas reserves, as compared to approximately 98% of our proved oil reserves and 96% of our proved natural gas reserves at December 31, 2020. 
At December 31, 2021, we had identified 4,381 gross (1,534 net) engineered locations for potential future drilling on our Delaware Basin acreage, primarily in the Wolfcamp or Bone Spring plays, but also including the shallower Brushy Canyon and Avalon formations. These locations include 2,204 gross (1,350 net) locations that we anticipate operating as we hold a working interest of at least 25% in each of these locations. Individual horizontal drilling locations represent a variety of lateral lengths, from one mile to greater than two miles based upon our current assumptions for a well that could be drilled at that location given our current acreage position. At December 31, 2021, approximately two-thirds of these identified drilling locations are expected to have horizontal lateral lengths of approximately two miles or greater and approximately 80% are expected to have horizontal lateral lengths of approximately 1.5 miles or greater. These engineered locations have been identified on a property-by-property basis and take into account criteria such as anticipated geologic conditions and reservoir properties, estimated rates of return, estimated recoveries from our Delaware Basin wells and other nearby wells based on available public data, drilling densities anticipated on our properties and properties of other operators, estimated drilling and completion costs, spacing and other rules established by regulatory authorities and surface considerations, among other criteria. Our engineered well locations, at December 31, 2021, do not yet include all portions of our acreage position. Our identified well locations presume that multiple intervals may be prospective at any one surface location. Although we believe that denser well spacing may be possible in certain asset areas or in certain formations, at December 31, 2021, the majority of our estimated locations were based on the assumption of 160-acre well spacing. As we explore and develop our Delaware Basin acreage further, we anticipate that we may identify additional locations for future drilling. At December 31, 2021, these potential future drilling locations included 358 gross (136 net) operated and non-operated locations in the Delaware Basin, primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays, but also in the Brushy Canyon, Avalon and Delaware formations, to which we have assigned proved undeveloped reserves.
At December 31, 2021, we were operating five drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin. At February 22, 2022, we had contracted a sixth drilling rig to begin drilling operations on recently acquired acreage in the western portion of our Ranger asset area in Lea County, New Mexico. We expect to operate six drilling rigs across our various Delaware Basin asset areas throughout the remainder of 2022, but these six drilling rigs are expected to have an increased focus on our Rustler Breaks, Antelope Ridge and Ranger asset areas in 2022, as compared to 2021. We have built significant optionality into our drilling program, which should generally allow us to decrease or increase the number of rigs we operate as necessary based on changing commodity prices and other factors. We are also planning to participate in non-operated wells in the Delaware Basin as these opportunities arise in 2022. 
Antelope Ridge Asset Area - Lea County, New Mexico
At the end of the first quarter of 2021, we achieved the first of the five operational milestones we set for Matador in 2021 when we turned to sales four gross (3.8 net) wells on the Rodney Robinson leasehold. These wells were the second group of wells drilled on the Rodney Robinson leasehold, which was acquired in the BLM Acquisition. We did not turn to sales any other operated wells in other portions of the Antelope Ridge asset area during 2021, although we did participate in the drilling and completion of 20 gross (1.1 net) non-operated wells that were turned to sales in the Antelope Ridge asset area during 2021. 
The 1,300 gross and net acre Rodney Robinson leasehold is one of the key tracts we acquired in the BLM Acquisition. The federal leases provide an 87.5% net revenue interest (“NRI”) as compared to approximately 75% NRI on most fee leases today. The four Rodney Robinson wells, which included two Wolfcamp A-XY completions and two Third Bone Spring 
completions, were turned to sales late in the first quarter of 2021 and were all two-mile laterals. These four Rodney Robinson wells have produced in aggregate approximately 1.5 million BOE in approximately 11 months of production despite being produced on restricted chokes throughout their early producing lives. We drilled nine additional Rodney Robinson wells in the fall of 2021, and these nine wells are expected to be turned to sales late in the first quarter of 2022. 
We turned to sales the initial six Rodney Robinson wells in the western portion of the Antelope Ridge asset area in late March 2020. In aggregate, these six wells have produced approximately 4.3 million BOE in approximately 22 months of production. 
Rustler Breaks Asset Area - Eddy County, New Mexico
In the Rustler Breaks asset area, we turned to sales 13 gross (0.9 net) non-operated wells during 2021. We did not turn to sales any operated wells during 2021, but at December 31, 2021, we had drilled or were drilling six operated wells in the Rustler Breaks asset area, all of which are expected to be turned to sales in the second quarter of 2022. We expect the Rustler Breaks asset area to be an area of increased operational focus for Matador throughout 2022.
Arrowhead Asset Area - Eddy County, New Mexico
In the Arrowhead asset area, we turned to sales 13 gross (11.5 net) operated wells and 14 gross (1.6 net) non-operated wells during 2021.
During the third quarter of 2021, we achieved the third of the five operational milestones we set for Matador in 2021 when we turned to sales four wells, all of which were two-mile laterals completed in the Second Bone Spring formation, in the Greater Stebbins Area. These four wells have produced in aggregate approximately 0.7 million BOE in seven months of production. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, we achieved the fifth and final operational milestone we set for Matador in 2021 when we turned to sales nine wells, all of which were two-mile laterals completed in the Third Bone Spring, Wolfcamp A-XY and Wolfcamp B formations, in the Greater Stebbins Area in December 2021.
Ranger and Twin Lakes Asset Areas - Lea County, New Mexico
In the Ranger asset area, we turned to sales two gross (1.3 net) operated wells and three gross (0.4 net) non-operated wells. We did not turn to sales any operated or non-operated wells in the Twin Lakes asset area during 2021.
We were pleased with the performance from the first two Uncle Ches wells turned to sales in the Second Bone Spring in the Ranger asset area in the first quarter of 2021. In aggregate, these two wells tested 4,053 BOE per day (90% oil) during 24-hour initial potential (“IP”) tests conducted after these wells were equipped with electric submersible pumps (“ESP”). The high (90%) oil cut and low water cut (approximately one Bbl of water per Bbl of oil produced) exhibited by these wells should enhance their economics. We drilled two additional Uncle Ches wells in the Ranger asset area in the fall of 2021, also Second Bone Spring completions, which were turned to sales in mid-January 2022. 
Stateline Asset Area - Eddy County, New Mexico
We operated two drilling rigs in our Stateline asset area for the majority of 2021. In early September 2018, we acquired the Stateline asset area in southern Eddy County, New Mexico as part of the BLM Acquisition. The Stateline asset area includes approximately 2,900 gross and net leasehold acres prospective for multiple geologic targets. The federal leases provide an 87.5% NRI. The large majority of the Stateline asset area acreage has shown to be conducive to drilling longer laterals of up to two miles or more, utilizing central facilities and multi-well pad development. We have been developing this acreage block drilling two-mile laterals on the eastern side of the leasehold and approximately 2.3-mile laterals on the western side of the leasehold. We began drilling operations in the Stateline asset area just before the end of 2019 and, at the end of the third quarter of 2020, we turned to sales our first 13 gross (13.0 net) wells on the Boros tract in the eastern portion of the Stateline asset area. In aggregate, the first 13 Boros wells have produced approximately 7.2 million BOE in approximately 15 months of production. 
After finishing drilling operations on the first 13 Boros wells in 2020, we began drilling operations on the Voni tract in the western portion of the Stateline asset area, and in the second quarter of 2021, we achieved the second of the five operational milestones we set for Matador in 2021 when we turned to sales our first 13 gross (12.7 net) wells on the Voni tract in the western portion of the Stateline asset area. The 13 Voni wells had completed lateral lengths of approximately 12,000 feet, or about 2.3-miles, making them the longest laterals Matador has completed to date. The 13 Voni wells included one First Bone Spring completion, four Second Bone Spring completions, four Wolfcamp A-XY completions and four Wolfcamp A-Lower completions. Of particular note, the Voni Federal #216H well, a Wolfcamp A-Lower completion, tested 5,073 BOE per day (60% oil), which was the highest 24-hour IP Matador has achieved to date in any formation in the Delaware Basin. These 13 Voni wells have produced in aggregate approximately 5.2 million BOE in approximately eight months of production, despite a number of these wells being produced on restricted chokes early in their producing lives. 
After finishing drilling operations on the first 13 Voni wells, we began drilling operations on the next 13 Boros wells, and in the third quarter of 2021, we achieved the fourth of the five operational milestones we set for Matador in 2021 when we 
turned to sales our second group of 13 gross (13.0 net) wells on the Boros tract in the eastern portion of the Stateline asset area. These 13 Boros wells have produced in aggregate approximately 2.2 million BOE in five months of production. Drilling and completion costs for the 26 Stateline wells turned to sales during 2021 averaged $628 per completed lateral foot, the lowest costs we have achieved in any of our asset areas.
In addition, during 2021, we drilled and completed our second group of 11 wells on the Voni tract on the western portion of the Stateline leasehold. These 11 Voni wells are expected to have completed lateral lengths of approximately 12,000 feet and were turned to sales in the first quarter of 2022.
Wolf and Jackson Trust Asset Areas - Loving County, Texas
In the Wolf and Jackson Trust asset areas, we turned to sales two gross (1.9 net) operated wells during 2021. At December 31, 2021, we were in the process of completing three two-mile lateral wells in the Second Bone Spring formation, and these three wells were turned to sales in February 2022. 
South Texas — Eagle Ford Shale and Other Formations
The Eagle Ford shale extends across portions of South Texas from the Mexican border into East Texas forming a band roughly 50 to 100 miles wide and 400 miles long. The Eagle Ford is an organically rich calcareous shale and lies between the deeper Buda limestone and the shallower Austin Chalk formation. Along the entire length of the Eagle Ford trend, the structural dip of the formation is consistently down to the south with relatively few, modestly sized structural perturbations. As a result, depth of burial increases consistently southwards along with the thermal maturity of the formation. Where the Eagle Ford is shallow, it is less thermally mature and therefore more oil prone, and as it gets deeper and becomes more thermally mature, the Eagle Ford is more natural gas prone. The transition between being more oil prone and more natural gas prone includes an interval that typically produces liquids-rich natural gas with condensate.
At December 31, 2021, our properties included approximately 27,400 gross (25,100 net) acres in the Eagle Ford shale play in South Texas. We believe that approximately 89% of our Eagle Ford acreage is prospective predominantly for oil or liquids-rich natural gas with condensate, with the remainder being prospective for less liquids-rich natural gas. All of our Eagle Ford leasehold was held by existing production at December 31, 2021.
We did not conduct any operated or non-operated drilling and completion activities on our leasehold properties in South Texas during the year ended December 31, 2021. In fact, as of December 31, 2021, we had not completed any new operated wells in the Eagle Ford shale since the second quarter of 2019. As a result, our average daily oil equivalent production from the Eagle Ford shale decreased 12% to 2,126 BOE per day, including 1,528 Bbl of oil per day and 3.6 MMcf of natural gas per day, during 2021, as compared to 2,412 BOE per day, including 1,840 Bbl of oil per day and 3.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, during 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 2% of our total daily oil equivalent production was attributable to the Eagle Ford shale, as compared to 3% for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
At December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, or 5.7 million BOE, was attributable to the Eagle Ford shale, including approximately 4.1 million Bbl of oil and 9.1 Bcf of natural gas. Our Eagle Ford total proved reserves comprised approximately 2% of our proved oil reserves and 1% of our proved natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, essentially unchanged from December 31, 2020. 
At December 31, 2021, we had identified 208 gross (175 net) engineered locations for potential future drilling on our Eagle Ford acreage, including 55 gross (55 net) engineered locations in Zavala County that were divested in January 2022. Each drilling location represents a horizontal lateral, and individual locations have estimated lateral lengths ranging from one mile to almost two miles. These locations have been identified on a property-by-property basis and take into account criteria such as anticipated geologic conditions and reservoir properties, estimated rates of return, estimated recoveries from our producing Eagle Ford wells and other nearby wells based on available public data, drilling densities anticipated on our properties and observed on properties of other operators, estimated drilling and completion costs, spacing and other rules established by regulatory authorities and surface considerations, among other factors. 
These engineered drilling locations include only a single interval in the lower portion of the Eagle Ford shale. We believe portions of our Eagle Ford acreage may be prospective for an additional target in the lower portion of the Eagle Ford shale and for other intervals in the upper portion of the Eagle Ford shale, from which we would expect to produce predominantly oil and liquids. In addition, we believe portions of our South Texas acreage may also be prospective for the Austin Chalk, Buda and other formations, from which we would expect to produce predominantly oil and liquids. At December 31, 2021, we had not included any future drilling locations in the upper portion of the Eagle Ford shale, in any additional intervals of the lower portion of the Eagle Ford shale or in the Austin Chalk or Buda formations, even though activity from other operators in these formations around our South Texas acreage position has demonstrated the prospectivity of these intervals.
Northwest Louisiana — Haynesville Shale, Cotton Valley and Other Formations
The Haynesville shale is an organically rich, overpressured marine shale found below the Cotton Valley and Bossier formations and above the Smackover formation at depths ranging from 10,500 to 13,500 feet across a broad region throughout Northwest Louisiana, including principally Bossier, Caddo, DeSoto and Red River Parishes in Louisiana. The Haynesville shale produces primarily dry natural gas with almost no associated liquids. The Bossier shale is overpressured and is often divided into lower, middle and upper units. The Cotton Valley formation is a low permeability natural gas sand that ranges in thickness from 200 to 300 feet and has porosity ranging from 6% to 10%.
We did not conduct any operated drilling and completion activities on our leasehold properties in Northwest Louisiana during 2021, although we did participate in the drilling and completion of seven gross (less than 0.1 net) non-operated Haynesville shale wells that were turned to sales in 2021. In the first quarter of 2020, we leased 2,800 net acres of our minerals in the southern portion of our Pine Island asset area to a third party and retained royalty interests ranging from 18% to 20%. This lessee turned to sales four Haynesville shale wells drilled on these interests in the first half of 2021. We do not plan to drill any operated Haynesville shale or Cotton Valley wells in 2022.
At December 31, 2021, we held approximately 19,100 gross (17,700 net) acres in Northwest Louisiana, including 16,700 gross (9,100 net) acres in the Haynesville shale play and 16,100 gross (14,900 net) acres in the Cotton Valley play. We operate substantially all of our Cotton Valley and shallower production on our leasehold interests in Northwest Louisiana, as well as all of our Haynesville production on the acreage outside of what we believe to be the core area of the Haynesville shale play. We operate approximately 8% of the 11,600 gross (4,800 net) acres that we consider to be in the core area of the Haynesville shale play. All of our leasehold in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana was held by existing production at December 31, 2021. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 4% of our average daily oil equivalent production, or 3,516 BOE per day, including nine Bbl of oil per day and 21.0 MMcf of natural gas per day, was attributable to our leasehold interests in Northwest Louisiana, while for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 7% of our average daily oil equivalent production, or 5,241 BOE per day, including eight Bbl of oil per day and 31.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, was attributable to our properties in Northwest Louisiana. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 9% of our daily natural gas production, or 21.0 MMcf of natural gas per day, was attributable to our leasehold interests in Northwest Louisiana, while for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 17% of our daily natural gas production, or 31.4 MMcf of natural gas per day, was attributable to these properties. At December 31, 2021, approximately 2% of our estimated total proved reserves, or 5.7 million BOE, was attributable to our properties in Northwest Louisiana.
At December 31, 2021, we had identified 161 gross (15 net) engineered locations for potential future drilling in the Haynesville shale play and 154 gross (35 net) engineered locations for potential future drilling in the Cotton Valley formation. Each drilling location represents a horizontal lateral, and individual locations have estimated lateral lengths ranging from one mile to two miles, with most being two miles. These locations have been identified on a property-by-property basis and take into account criteria such as anticipated geologic conditions and reservoir properties, estimated rates of return, estimated recoveries from our producing Haynesville and Cotton Valley wells and other nearby wells based on available public data, drilling densities observed on properties of other operators, including on some of our non-operated properties, estimated drilling and completion costs, spacing and other rules established by regulatory authorities and surface conditions, among other factors. 
Midstream Segment
Our midstream segment conducts midstream operations in support of our exploration, development and production operations and provides natural gas processing, oil transportation services, oil, natural gas and produced water gathering services and produced water disposal services to third parties.
Southeast New Mexico and West Texas — Delaware Basin
On February 17, 2017, we announced the formation of San Mateo, a strategic joint venture with Five Point. The midstream assets that were contributed to San Mateo included (i) the Black River Processing Plant (before its expansions); (ii) one salt water disposal well and a related commercial salt water disposal facility in the Rustler Breaks asset area; (iii) three salt water disposal wells and related commercial salt water disposal facilities in the Wolf asset area and (iv) substantially all related oil, natural gas and produced water gathering systems and pipelines in both the Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas (collectively, the “Delaware Midstream Assets”). We received $171.5 million in connection with the formation of San Mateo and had the potential to earn up to $73.5 million in performance incentives over a five-year period, which in October 2020 was extended by an additional year. At February 22, 2022, we had earned $58.8 million of the potential $73.5 million in performance incentives. Through February 22, 2022, Five Point had paid $14.7 million in performance incentives in each of the first quarters of 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and we may earn up to the remaining $14.7 million in San Mateo performance incentives over the next year relating to the formation of San Mateo. In connection with the formation of San Mateo, we dedicated to San Mateo current and certain future leasehold interests in the Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas pursuant to 15-
year, fixed fee oil, natural gas and produced water gathering and produced water disposal agreements. In addition, we dedicated current and certain future leasehold interests in the Rustler Breaks asset area to San Mateo pursuant to a 15-year, fixed fee natural gas processing agreement.
On February 25, 2019, we announced the formation of San Mateo Midstream II, LLC (“San Mateo II”), a strategic joint venture with Five Point designed to expand our midstream operations in the Delaware Basin, specifically in Eddy County, New Mexico. In addition, Five Point committed to pay $125.0 million of the first $150.0 million of capital expenditures incurred by San Mateo II to develop facilities in the Greater Stebbins Area and the Stateline asset area. The $150.0 million threshold for capital expenditures was reached during 2020 and additional capital expenditures are the responsibility of the Company and Five Point based on each company’s proportionate interest in San Mateo. In addition, we have the ability to earn up to $150.0 million in performance incentives over the next several years, plus additional performance incentives for securing volumes from third-party customers. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we met the threshold requirements to begin earning the additional $150.0 million in performance incentives from Five Point. At February 22, 2022, we had received $33.9 million of the potential $150.0 million in performance incentives. In connection with the formation of San Mateo II, we dedicated to San Mateo II acreage in the Greater Stebbins Area and the Stateline asset area pursuant to 15-year, fixed-fee oil, natural gas and produced water gathering, natural gas processing and produced water disposal agreements. 
Effective October 1, 2020, San Mateo II merged with and into San Mateo. The Company and Five Point own 51% and 49% of San Mateo, respectively. San Mateo provides firm service to us, while also being a midstream service provider to other customers in and around our Stateline, Wolf and Rustler Breaks asset areas and the Greater Stebbins Area. We retain operational control of San Mateo and continue to operate the Delaware Midstream Assets, the expanded Black River Processing Plant and facilities that have been developed in the Greater Stebbins Area and the Stateline asset area.
Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Assets
The Black River Processing Plant and associated gathering system were originally built to support our ongoing and future development efforts in the Rustler Breaks asset area and to provide us with firm takeaway and processing services for our Rustler Breaks natural gas production. We had previously completed the installation and testing of a 12-inch natural gas trunk line and associated gathering lines running throughout the length of our Rustler Breaks acreage position, and these natural gas gathering lines are being used to gather almost all of our operated natural gas production at Rustler Breaks. 
During the third quarter of 2020, San Mateo completed the construction and successful start-up of the expansion of the Black River Processing Plant to add an incremental designed inlet capacity of 200 MMcf of natural gas per day to the existing designed inlet capacity of 260 MMcf of natural gas per day, bringing the total designed inlet capacity to 460 MMcf of natural gas per day. The expanded Black River Processing Plant supports our exploration and development activities in the Delaware Basin and, at December 31, 2021, was gathering and processing natural gas from the Stateline asset area and from the Greater Stebbins Area. The Black River Processing Plant also processes natural gas from our Rustler Breaks asset area and provides natural gas processing services for other San Mateo customers in the area. 
In September 2020, San Mateo completed and placed in service approximately 43 miles of large diameter natural gas gathering pipelines between the Black River Processing Plant and the Stateline asset area (approximately 24 miles) and the Greater Stebbins Area (approximately 19 miles). At December 31, 2021, San Mateo was gathering or transporting all our operated natural gas production via pipeline in the Stateline asset area, the Greater Stebbins Area, the Rustler Breaks asset area and the Wolf asset area.
In addition, in early 2018, San Mateo completed a natural gas liquids (“NGL”) pipeline connection at the Black River Processing Plant to the NGL pipeline owned by EPIC Y-Grade Pipeline LP. This NGL connection provides several significant benefits to us and other San Mateo customers compared to transporting the NGLs by truck. San Mateo’s customers receive (i) firm NGL takeaway out of the Delaware Basin, (ii) increased NGL recoveries, (iii) improved pricing realizations through lower transportation and fractionation costs, (iv) increased optionality through San Mateo’s ability to operate the Black River Processing Plant in ethane recovery mode, if desired, and (v) a reliable alternative to pipe rather than to truck NGLs during severe weather events and otherwise.
In our Wolf asset area in Loving County, Texas, San Mateo gathers our natural gas production with the natural gas gathering system we retained following the sale of our wholly-owned subsidiary that owned certain natural gas gathering and processing assets in the Wolf asset area, including a cryogenic natural gas processing plant and approximately six miles of high-pressure gathering pipelines.
At December 31, 2021, San Mateo’s natural gas gathering systems included natural gas gathering pipelines and related compression and treating systems. During the year ended December 31, 2021, San Mateo gathered approximately 86.1 Bcf of natural gas, an increase of 17%, as compared to 73.9 Bcf of natural gas gathered during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, San Mateo processed approximately 77.6 Bcf of natural gas at the Black River Processing Plant, an increase of 28%, as compared to 60.8 Bcf of natural gas processed during the year ended 
December 31, 2020. Natural gas gathering and processing volumes for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 do not include the full quantity of volumes that would have otherwise been delivered by certain San Mateo customers subject to minimum volume commitments (although partial deliveries were made in both years), but for which San Mateo recognized revenues.
Crude Oil Gathering and Transportation Assets
San Mateo and Plains have entered into a strategic relationship to gather and transport crude oil for upstream producers in Eddy County, New Mexico and have agreed to work together through a joint tariff arrangement and related transactions to offer producers located within a joint development area crude oil transportation services from the wellhead to Midland, Texas with access to other end markets. 
In 2020, San Mateo completed and placed into service (i) a crude oil gathering and transportation system in the Greater Stebbins Area that was connected to the existing interconnect in the Rustler Breaks asset area via approximately 19 miles of various diameter crude oil pipelines and (ii) a crude oil gathering system in the Stateline asset area. With these oil gathering and transportation systems (collectively with the crude oil gathering and transportation system in the Rustler Breaks asset area and the crude oil gathering system in the Wolf asset area, the “San Mateo Oil Pipeline Systems”) in service, at December 31, 2021, we estimated we had on pipe almost all of our oil production from the Stateline, Wolf and Rustler Breaks asset areas and the Greater Stebbins Area.
At December 31, 2021, the San Mateo Oil Pipeline Systems included crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines from points of origin in Eddy County, New Mexico and Loving County, Texas to interconnects with Plains and two trucking facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the San Mateo Oil Pipeline Systems had throughput of approximately 14.9 million Bbl of oil, an increase of 28%, as compared to throughput of approximately 11.6 million Bbl of oil during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Produced Water Gathering and Disposal Assets
During 2021, San Mateo placed into service one commercial salt water disposal well in the Greater Stebbins Area, bringing San Mateo’s commercial salt water disposal well count in the Greater Stebbins Area to three. In addition to its three commercial salt water disposal wells and associated facilities in the Greater Stebbins Area, at February 22, 2022, San Mateo had eight commercial salt water disposal wells and associated facilities in the Rustler Breaks asset area, three commercial salt water disposal wells and associated facilities in the Wolf asset area and produced water gathering systems in the Stateline, Rustler Breaks and Wolf asset areas and the Greater Stebbins Area. At February 22, 2022, San Mateo had designed disposal capacity of approximately 370,000 Bbl of produced water per day.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, San Mateo handled approximately 101.4 million Bbl of produced water, an increase of 20%, as compared to approximately 84.8 million Bbl of produced water handled during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
South Texas / Northwest Louisiana
In South Texas, we own a natural gas gathering system that gathers natural gas production from certain of our operated Eagle Ford leases. In Northwest Louisiana, we have midstream assets that gather natural gas from most of our operated leases. Our midstream assets in South Texas and Northwest Louisiana are not part of San Mateo.

Our total oil equivalent production of approximately 31.5 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 14% from our total oil equivalent production of approximately 27.5 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increased production was primarily due to our delineation and development operations in the Delaware Basin throughout 2021, which offset declining production in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales. Our average daily oil equivalent production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 86,176 BOE per day, as compared to 75,175 BOE per day for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average daily oil production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 48,876 Bbl of oil per day, an increase of 12% from 43,526 Bbl of oil per day for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our average daily natural gas production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 223.8 MMcf of natural gas per day, an increase of 18% from 189.9 MMcf of natural gas per day for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our total oil equivalent production of approximately 27.5 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 14% from our total oil equivalent production of approximately 24.2 million BOE for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increased production was primarily due to our delineation and development operations in the Delaware Basin throughout 2020, which offset declining production in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales.

Producing Wells
The following table sets forth information relating to producing wells at December 31, 2021. Wells are classified as oil wells or natural gas wells according to their predominant production stream. We had an approximate average working interest of 81% in all wells that we operated at December 31, 2021. For wells where we are not the operator, our working interests range from less than 1% to approximately 52% and average approximately 10%. In the table below, gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we own a working interest, and net wells represent the total of our fractional working interests owned in the gross wells.

Estimated Proved Reserves
The following table sets forth our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our production and proved reserves are reported in two streams: oil and natural gas, including both dry and liquids-rich natural gas. Where we produce liquids-rich natural gas, such as in the Delaware Basin and the Eagle Ford shale, the economic value of the NGLs associated with the natural gas is included in the estimated wellhead natural gas price on those properties where the NGLs are extracted and sold. The reserves estimates were based on evaluations prepared by our engineering staff and have been audited for their reasonableness by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent reservoir engineers. These reserves estimates were prepared in accordance with SEC rules for oil and natural gas reserves reporting. The estimated reserves shown are for proved reserves only and do not include any unproved reserves classified as probable or possible reserves that might exist for our properties, nor do they include any consideration that could be attributable to interests in unproved and unevaluated acreage beyond those tracts for which proved reserves have been estimated. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.

(1)Numbers in table may not total due to rounding.
(2)Our estimated proved reserves, Standardized Measure and PV-10 were determined using index prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the life of the properties. The unweighted arithmetic averages of the first-day-of-the-month prices for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021 were $63.04 per Bbl for oil and $3.60 per MMBtu for natural gas, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 were $36.04 per Bbl for oil and $1.99 per MMBtu for natural gas and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 were $52.19 per Bbl for oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas. These prices were adjusted by property for quality, energy content, regional price differentials, transportation fees, marketing deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead. We report our proved reserves in two streams, oil and natural gas, and the economic value of the NGLs associated with the natural gas is included in the estimated wellhead natural gas price on those properties where the NGLs are extracted and sold. 
(3)Estimated using a conversion ratio of one Bbl of oil per six Mcf of natural gas. 
(4)Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows. Standardized Measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of our properties.
(5)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. PV-10 is not an estimate of the fair market value of our properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies and of the potential return on investment related to the companies’ properties without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. Our PV-10 at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 may be reconciled to our Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at such dates by adding the discounted future income taxes associated with such reserves to the Standardized Measure. The discounted future income taxes at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were, in millions, $972.2, $73.6 and $214.2, respectively.

Our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 20% from 270.3 million BOE at December 31, 2020 to 323.4 million BOE at December 31, 2021. This increase in proved oil and natural gas reserves was primarily attributable to (i) our delineation and development operations in the Delaware Basin during 2021 and (ii) the 75% increase in oil prices and the 81% increase in natural gas prices used to estimate total proved reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020. We added 33.1 million BOE in proved oil and natural gas reserves through extensions and discoveries during 2021, of which 22.4 million BOE resulted from new well locations drilled during 2021 to establish proved developed reserves and 26.9 million BOE resulted primarily from new proved undeveloped locations identified as a result of drilling activities on our existing acreage in the Delaware Basin during 2021, but which were partially offset by the removal of 16.3 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves that were not developed or were no longer expected to be developed within five years of their initial booking resulting from changes in development plans for certain of our properties in the Delaware Basin. As we continue to develop our Delaware Basin assets, we may reclassify some or all of this 16.3 million BOE to proved reserves at a future date. We realized approximately 41.9 million BOE in net upward revisions to prior estimates, 96% of which were attributable to the significantly higher commodity prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021, which resulted in longer estimated economic lives for certain of our properties. We also had small upward revisions to prior estimates attributable to increased working interests and lower estimated operating costs on certain of our properties. In addition, we realized 9.5 million BOE in net upward revisions to our proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021 as a result of property acquisitions and divestitures completed during 2021.
Our proved oil reserves grew 13% from approximately 159.9 million Bbl at December 31, 2020 to approximately 181.3 million Bbl at December 31, 2021. Our proved natural gas reserves increased 29% from 662.3 Bcf at December 31, 2020 to 
852.5 Bcf at December 31, 2021. Our proved reserves to production ratio at December 31, 2021 was 10.3, an increase of 5% from 9.8 at December 31, 2020.
The Standardized Measure of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 176% from $1.58 billion at December 31, 2020 to $4.38 billion at December 31, 2021. The PV-10 of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves increased 223% from $1.66 billion at December 31, 2020 to $5.35 billion at December 31, 2021. The increases in our Standardized Measure and PV-10 are primarily a result of the significantly higher weighted average oil and natural gas prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020, but also due to the 20% increase in our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to December 31, 2020. The unweighted arithmetic averages of first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021 were $63.04 per Bbl and $3.60 per MMBtu, an increase of 75% and 81%, respectively, as compared to average oil and natural gas prices of $36.04 per Bbl and $1.99 per MMBtu used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2020. Our total proved reserves were made up of 56% oil and 44% natural gas at December 31, 2021 and 59% oil and 41% natural gas at December 31, 2020. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure, see the preceding table.
The following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved developed reserves at December 31, 2021.

Our proved developed oil and natural gas reserves increased 56% from 123.5 million BOE at December 31, 2020 to 193.3 million BOE at December 31, 2021. We added 22.4 million BOE in proved developed reserves through extensions and discoveries during 2021, which resulted from new well locations drilled during 2021 to establish proved reserves. We realized approximately 33.8 million BOE in net upward revisions to prior estimates, 97% of which was attributable to the significantly higher commodity prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021, which resulted in longer estimated economic lives for certain of our producing properties. We also had small upward revisions to prior estimates attributable to increased working interests and lower estimated operating costs on certain of our producing properties. In addition, we converted 40.1 million BOE of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through our development activities in the Delaware Basin during 2021, primarily in our Stateline asset area, in the Greater Stebbins Area and in the Rodney Robinson leasehold in the Antelope Ridge asset area. In addition, we realized 4.9 million BOE in net upward revisions to our proved developed reserves at December 31, 2021 as a result of property acquisitions and divestitures completed during 2021. These cumulative net upward revisions of 101.2 million BOE to our proved developed reserves exceeded by 3.2 times our total oil and natural gas production of 31.5 million BOE in 2021.
Our proved developed oil reserves increased 47% from 69.6 million Bbl at December 31, 2020 to 102.2 million Bbl at December 31, 2021. Our proved developed natural gas reserves increased 69% from 323.2 Bcf at December 31, 2020 to 546.2 Bcf at December 31, 2021. Proved developed reserves constituted 60% of our total proved oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, as compared to 46% at December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021.

Our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves decreased 11% from 146.8 million BOE at December 31, 2020 to 130.1 million at December 31, 2021. We added 26.9 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves through extensions and discoveries during 2021, which resulted primarily from new proved undeveloped locations identified as a result of drilling activities on our existing acreage in the Delaware Basin during 2021 but which were partially offset by the removal of 16.3 million BOE in proved undeveloped reserves that were not developed or were no longer expected to be developed within five years of their initial booking resulting from changes in development plans for certain of the properties in the Delaware Basin. We realized approximately 8.1 million BOE in net upward revisions to our prior estimates of proved undeveloped reserves, 90% of which was attributable to the significantly higher commodity prices used to estimate proved reserves at December 31, 2021, which resulted in longer estimated economic lives for certain of our proved undeveloped locations. We also had small upward revisions to prior estimates attributable to increased working interests and lower estimated operating costs on certain of our proved undeveloped locations. In addition, we realized 4.6 million BOE in net upward revisions to our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 as a result of property acquisitions and divestitures completed during 2021. During 2021, we also converted 40.1 million BOE of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through our development activities in the Delaware Basin during 2021, primarily in our Stateline asset area, in the Greater Stebbins Area and in the Rodney Robinson leasehold in the Antelope Ridge asset area.
At December 31, 2021, we had no proved undeveloped reserves in our estimates that remained undeveloped for five years or more following their initial booking, and we currently have plans to use anticipated capital resources to develop the proved undeveloped reserves remaining as of December 31, 2021 within five years of booking these reserves. The following table sets forth, since 2018, proved undeveloped reserves converted to proved developed reserves during each year and the investments associated with these conversions (dollars in thousands).

(1)Numbers in table may not total due to rounding.
(2)Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, less estimated future development, production, plugging and abandonment costs and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future cash flows. Standardized Measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of our properties.
(3)PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. PV-10 is not an estimate of the fair market value of our properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies and of the potential return on investment related to the companies’ properties without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. Our PV-10 at December 31, 2021 may be reconciled to our Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows at such date by adding the discounted future income taxes associated with such reserves to the Standardized Measure. The discounted future income taxes at December 31, 2021 were approximately $972.2 million.

(5)Includes one well producing oil from the Austin Chalk formation in La Salle County, Texas and two wells producing small quantities of natural gas from the San Miguel formation in Zavala County, Texas. The two wells in Zavala County, Texas were divested in January 2022.
(6)Includes the Cotton Valley formation and shallower zones and also includes one well producing from the Frio formation in Orange County, Texas.
Technology Used to Establish Reserves
Under current SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, we used technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and technical data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, electric logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available pressure and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production performance methods. Certain new producing properties with little production history were forecasted using a combination of production performance and analogy to offset production. Non-producing reserves estimates for both developed and undeveloped properties were forecasted using either analogy and/or volumetric methods.
Internal Control Over Reserves Estimation Process
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used in our reserves estimation process. Individual asset teams are responsible for the day-to-day management of the oil and natural gas activities for each team’s asset area. These asset teams are staffed with reservoir engineers who prepare reserves estimates at the end of each calendar quarter for the assets they manage. Our Reserves Manager was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates in 2021. He received Bachelor of Science degrees in both Petroleum Engineering and Mechanical Engineering from Texas Tech University, is a licensed Professional 
Engineer in the state of Texas and has over nine years of industry experience. Our Reserves Manager works under the direct supervision of our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and Senior Asset Manager, who received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&M University and has over 14 years of industry experience. The Company has established internal controls over its reserves estimation processes and procedures to support the accurate and timely preparation and disclosure of reserves estimates in accordance with SEC and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requirements. These controls include oversight of the reserves estimation processes by our internal reserves group as well as accounting and finance personnel. Following the preparation of our reserves estimates, these estimates are audited for their reasonableness by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., independent reservoir engineers. Members of our executive committee and members of the Operations and Engineering Committee of our Board of Directors review the reserves report and our reserves estimation process, and the independent audit of our reserves is reviewed by other members of our Board of Directors as well.
Acreage Summary
The following table sets forth the approximate acreage in which we held a leasehold, mineral or other interest at December 31, 2021.

__________________
(1)Some of the same leases cover the gross and net acreage shown for both the Haynesville formation and the shallower Cotton Valley formation. Therefore, the sum of the gross and net acreage for both formations is not equal to the total gross and net acreage for Northwest Louisiana.
Undeveloped Acreage Expiration
The following table sets forth the approximate number of gross and net undeveloped acres at December 31, 2021 that will expire over the next five years by operating area unless production is established within the spacing units covering the acreage prior to the expiration dates, the existing leases are renewed prior to expiration or continued operations maintain the leases beyond the expiration of each respective primary term. Undeveloped acreage expiring in 2027 and beyond totals 6,700 net acres, all of which is in the Delaware Basin. All of our leasehold in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and in the Haynesville and Cotton Valley plays in Northwest Louisiana was held by existing production at December 31, 2021.
 | Acres | Acres | | Acres | Acres | Acres

__________________
(1)Approximately 65% of the acreage expiring in the Delaware Basin in the next five years is associated with our Twin Lakes asset area in northern Lea County, New Mexico. We expect to hold or extend portions of certain expiring acreage in the Delaware Basin through our future drilling activities or by paying an additional lease bonus, where applicable.
Many of the leases comprising the acreage set forth in the table above will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless operations are conducted to maintain the respective leases in effect beyond the expiration of the primary term or production from the acreage has been established prior to such date, in which event the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production in commercial quantities in most cases. We also have options to extend some of our leases through additional lease bonus payments prior to the expiration of the primary term of the leases. In addition, we may attempt to secure a new lease upon the expiration of certain of our acreage; however, there may be third-party leases, or top leases, that become effective immediately if our leases expire at the end of their respective terms and production has not been established prior to such date or operations are not conducted to maintain the leases in effect beyond the primary term. As of December 31, 2021, 
our leases are primarily fee and state leases with primary terms of three to five years and federal leases with primary terms of 10 years. We believe that our lease terms are similar to our competitors’ lease terms as they relate to both primary term and royalty interests. At December 31, 2021, less than 2% of our proved oil and natural gas reserves would be impacted by the expirations of this undeveloped acreage. 
Drilling Results
The following table summarizes our drilling activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

At December 31, 2021, we had a total of 31 gross (27.0 net) development wells and two gross (1.1 net) exploration wells that were in the process of being drilled, being completed or awaiting completion operations.
Marketing and Customers
Our crude oil is sold under both long-term and short-term oil purchase agreements with unaffiliated purchasers based on published price bulletins reflecting an established field posting price. As a consequence, the prices we receive for crude oil and our heavier liquid products move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it reacts to supply and demand factors. The prices of our lighter liquid products move up and down independently of any relationship between the crude oil and natural gas markets. Transportation costs related to moving crude oil and liquids are also deducted from the price received for crude oil and liquids.
Our natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas produced by us is sold at various delivery points to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated midstream companies. The prices we receive are calculated based on various pipeline indices. When there is an opportunity to do so, we may have our natural gas processed at San Mateo’s or third parties’ processing facilities to extract liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas. We are then paid for the extracted liquids based on either a negotiated percentage of the proceeds that are generated from the sale of the liquids or other negotiated pricing arrangements using then-current market pricing less fixed rate processing, transportation and fractionation fees.
The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production fluctuate widely. Factors that, directly or indirectly, cause price fluctuations include the level of demand for oil and natural gas, the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and certain other oil-exporting countries (“OPEC+”), weather conditions, including hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region and severe cold weather in the Delaware Basin, oil and natural gas storage levels, transportation and refinery capacity constraints, domestic and foreign governmental regulations, price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions in oil and natural gas producing regions, including Russia, Ukraine, China and the Middle East, domestic or global health concerns such as COVID-19, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions. Decreases in these commodity prices adversely affect the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Short-term disruptions of our oil and natural gas production occur from time to time due to downstream pipeline system failure, capacity issues and scheduled maintenance, as well as maintenance and repairs involving our own well operations. These situations, if they occur, curtail our production capabilities and ability to maintain a steady source of revenue. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Financial Condition—Our success is dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas. Low oil and natural gas prices and the continued volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations.”
The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production often reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) oil price or the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we receive is called a differential. Increases in the differential between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Financial Condition—An increase in 
the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had three, two and two significant purchasers, respectively, that accounted for approximately 72%, 65% and 67%, respectively, of our total oil, natural gas and NGL revenues. If we lost one or more of these significant purchasers and were unable to sell our production to other purchasers on terms we consider acceptable, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For further details regarding these purchasers, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. Such information is incorporated herein by reference.
Title to Properties
We endeavor to ensure that title to our properties is in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. While we rely upon the judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers and/or landmen in ascertaining title for certain leasehold and mineral interest acquisitions, we typically obtain detailed title opinions prior to drilling an oil and natural gas well. Some of our acreage is subject to agreements that require the drilling of wells or the undertaking of other exploratory or development activities in order to retain our interests in the acreage. Our title to these contractual interests may be contingent upon our satisfactory fulfillment of such obligations. Some of our properties are also subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to financing arrangements, operating agreements, taxes and other similar burdens that we believe will not materially interfere with the use and operation of these properties or affect the value thereof. Generally, we intend to conduct operations, make lease rental payments or produce oil and natural gas from wells in paying quantities, where required, prior to expiration of various time periods in order to avoid lease termination. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Financial Condition—We may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest.”
We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to customary encumbrances, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens or encumbrances will materially interfere with the use and operation of these properties in the conduct of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient right-of-way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business. As discussed below in “—Regulation,” the Biden administration has issued certain orders and implemented certain policies limiting or delaying the issuance of federal drilling permits and other necessary federal approvals. Although some of these restrictions have lapsed at December 31, 2021, the impact of federal actions related to the oil and natural gas industry remains unclear, and should those or other limitations or prohibitions be imposed or continue to be applied, our oil and natural gas operations on federal lands could be adversely impacted.
Seasonality
Generally, but not always, the demand and price levels for natural gas increase during winter and decrease during summer. To lessen seasonal demand fluctuations, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and forward purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. However, increased summertime demand for electricity can place increased demand on storage volumes. Demand for oil and heating oil is also generally higher in the winter and the summer driving season, although oil prices are affected more significantly by global supply and demand. Seasonal anomalies, such as mild winters, sometimes lessen these fluctuations. Certain of our drilling, completion and other operations are also subject to seasonal limitations where equipment may not be available during periods of peak demand or where weather conditions and events result in delayed operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Operations—Because our reserves and production are concentrated in a few core areas, problems with production in and markets for a particular area could have a material impact on our business.”
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development opportunities and acreage acquisitions as well as drilling rigs and other equipment and labor required to drill, complete, operate and develop our properties. We also compete with public and private midstream companies for natural gas gathering and processing opportunities, as well as produced water gathering and disposal and oil gathering and transportation activities in the areas in which we operate. In addition, competition in the midstream industry is based on the geographic location of facilities, business reputation, reliability and pricing arrangements for the services offered. San Mateo competes with other midstream companies that provide similar services in its areas of operations, and such companies may have legacy relationships with producers in those areas and may have a longer history of efficiency and reliability. 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, staffs, facilities and other resources. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be willing and able to pay more for drilling rigs, leasehold and mineral acreage, productive oil and natural gas properties or midstream facilities and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our competitors may also be able to afford to purchase and operate their own drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing equipment. 
Our ability to drill and explore for oil and natural gas, to acquire properties and to provide competitive midstream services will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. In addition, many of our competitors may have a longer history of operations. 
The oil and natural gas industry also competes with other energy-related industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Third Parties—Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil and natural gas, provide midstream services and secure trained personnel, and our competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford.”
Regulation
Oil and Natural Gas Regulation
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, midstream and related operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial monetary penalties or delay or suspension of operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because these laws, rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted and new laws, rules and regulations are promulgated, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are, or will become, subject. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are generally subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 
Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana and many other states require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. Many states also have laws, rules and regulations addressing conservation of oil and natural gas and other matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, the regulation of well spacing, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the prohibition, restriction or limitation of emissions, venting or flaring natural gas, the sourcing and disposal of water used and produced in the drilling and completion process, the seismicity that may be related to salt water disposal wells and the plugging and abandonment of wells. While not presently the case in the states in which we operate, some states restrict production to the market demand for oil and natural gas or prescribe ceiling prices for natural gas sold within their boundaries. Additionally, some regulatory agencies have, from time to time, imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below natural production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
Some of our oil and natural gas leases are issued by agencies of the federal government, as well as agencies of the states in which we operate. These leases contain various restrictions on access and development and other requirements that may impede our ability to conduct operations on the acreage represented by these leases. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued: (i) an order signed by the acting Secretary of the Interior providing for a 60-day pause limiting the authority of local offices of the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) to issue new leases and grant federal drilling permits and certain extensions, sundries, rights-of-way and other necessary approvals for the development of federal oil and natural gas leases; and (ii) an executive order signed by President Biden instructing the Department of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands pending completion of a comprehensive review and consideration of federal oil and natural gas permitting and leasing practices (together, the “Biden Administration Federal Lease Orders”). In 2019, 2020 and 2021, an environmental group filed three lawsuits in federal district courts in New Mexico and the District of Columbia challenging certain BLM lease sales, including lease sales in which we purchased leases in New Mexico (the “Lease Sale Litigation”). The Lease Sale Litigation challenges the BLM’s decision to hold the lease sales based on alleged defects in the environmental reviews conducted under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) in conjunction with those sales. In 2020, the New Mexico federal district court dismissed the case pending there. That decision was appealed to the Tenth Circuit, but the appeal was voluntarily dismissed in 2021. In February 2022, the BLM announced an internal policy of delaying approval of drilling permits associated with the leases subject to the Lease Sale Litigation, including the dismissed New Mexico case, while the BLM conducted additional NEPA analyses. The BLM has not announced when it will complete the additional NEPA review, and the outcome of that review with regard to the leases at issue and any related drilling permits is uncertain. 
In 2021, ten states, led by the State of Louisiana, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Louisiana against President Biden and various other federal government officials and agencies challenging an executive order directing the federal government to utilize certain calculations of the “social cost” of carbon and other greenhouse gases in its decision making (the “Social Cost of Carbon Litigation”). Among the decisions impacted by the executive order were NEPA reviews conducted in connection with oil and gas leasing and permitting decisions by the BLM. In February 2022, the Louisiana federal district court issued an injunction prohibiting the federal government, including the Department of Interior and BLM, from utilizing the challenged social cost of greenhouse gases factor as a part of NEPA reviews. Subsequent to that decision, the federal government submitted filings in the federal district court indicating that the court’s injunction could, among other things, result in an indefinite delay of future lease sales and permit approvals due to inconsistencies between the NEPA analyses and the court’s ruling.
Although some of the restrictions in the Biden Administrative Federal Lease Orders have lapsed at December 31, 2021, the impact of federal actions related to the oil and natural gas industry, including those in response to the Lease Sale Litigation and Social Cost of Carbon Litigation, remains unclear, and should limitations or prohibitions be imposed or continue to be applied, our oil and natural gas operations on federal lands could be adversely impacted. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Approximately 31% of our leasehold and mineral acres in the Delaware Basin is located on federal lands, which are subject to administrative permitting requirements and potential federal legislation, regulation and orders that may limit or restrict oil and natural gas operations on federal lands.”
Our sales of natural gas, as well as the revenues we receive from our sales, are affected by the availability, terms and costs of transportation. The rates, terms and conditions applicable to the interstate transportation of natural gas by pipelines are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the “NGA”), as well as under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the “NGPA”). Natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC under section 1(b) of the NGA, and intrastate crude oil pipeline facilities are not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate crude oil pipeline facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements or complaint-based rate regulation. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. In December 2018, San Mateo placed into service its crude oil gathering and transportation system in the Rustler Breaks asset area in Eddy County, New Mexico (the “Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System”) following an open season to gauge shipper interest in committed crude oil interstate transportation service on the Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System earlier in 2018. The Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System was expanded to the Greater Stebbins Area following another open season in the third quarter of 2020. The Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System, including the expansion to the Greater Stebbins Area, is subject to FERC jurisdiction and includes approximately 70 miles of various diameter crude oil pipelines from origin points in Eddy County, New Mexico to an interconnect with Plains. We believe that the other crude oil pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as an intrastate facility not subject to FERC jurisdiction. 
In 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “Energy Policy Act”). The Energy Policy Act, among other things, amended the NGA to prohibit market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of natural gas transportation services subject to FERC jurisdiction by any entity and to direct FERC to facilitate transparency in the market for the sale or transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce. The Energy Policy Act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of, among other things, the NGA, the NGPA or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder. FERC has promulgated regulations to implement the Energy Policy Act. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations, in addition to FERC-imposed penalties and disgorgement, we may also be subject to third-party damage claims.
Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies (and to a limited extent by FERC, as noted above). The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Because these regulations will apply to all intrastate natural gas shippers within the same state on a comparable basis, we believe that regulation in any states in which we operate will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from our competitors that are similarly situated.
As mentioned above, in December 2018, San Mateo placed into service the Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System. The Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System is subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “EP Act”). The ICA and its implementing regulations give FERC authority to regulate the rates charged for service on interstate common carrier pipelines and generally require the rates and practices of interstate crude oil pipelines to be just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory and not unduly preferential. The ICA also requires tariffs that set forth the rates an interstate crude oil pipeline company charges for providing transportation services on its FERC-jurisdictional pipelines, as well as the rules and regulations governing these services, to be maintained on file with FERC and posted publicly. The EP Act and its implementing 
regulations also generally allow interstate crude oil pipelines to annually index their rates up to a prescribed ceiling level and require that such pipelines index their rates down to the prescribed ceiling level if the index is negative. 
The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs will be affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation of such products to market. As noted above, under rules adopted by FERC, interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index, though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulations promulgated by state regulatory commissions, which vary from state to state. We are not able to predict with certainty the effects, if any, of these regulations on our operations.
In 2007, the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 (the “EISA”) went into effect. The EISA, among other things, prohibits market manipulation by any person in connection with the purchase or sale of crude oil, gasoline or petroleum distillates at wholesale in contravention of such rules and regulations that the Federal Trade Commission may prescribe, directs the Federal Trade Commission to enforce the regulations and establishes penalties for violations thereunder.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) imposes pipeline safety requirements on regulated pipelines and gathering lines pursuant to its authority under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act, each as amended. The Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System is subject to PHMSA oversight. The Department of Transportation, through PHMSA, has established rules regarding integrity management programs for interstate oil pipelines, including the Rustler Breaks Oil Pipeline System. In recent years, pursuant to these laws and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, PHMSA has expanded its regulation of gathering lines, subjecting previously unregulated pipelines to requirements regarding damage prevention, corrosion control, public education programs, maximum allowable operating pressure limits and other requirements. Certain of our natural gas gathering lines are federally “regulated gathering lines” subject to PHMSA requirements. On April 8, 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements in areas with medium population densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore natural gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. On January 13, 2017, PHMSA issued, but did not publish, a similar proposed rule for hazardous liquids (i.e., oil) pipelines and gathering lines. It is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect as, on January 20, 2017, the Trump administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. In addition, states have adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations, for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety regulations.”
Additional expansion of pipeline safety requirements or our operations could subject us to more stringent or costly safety standards, which could result in increased operating costs or operational delays.
U.S. Federal and State Taxation
The federal, state and local governments in the areas in which we operate impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products we sell and, for many of our wells, sales and use taxes on significant portions of our drilling and operating costs. Many states have raised state taxes on energy sources or state taxes associated with the extraction of hydrocarbons, and additional increases may occur. For instance, in New Mexico, there have been proposals to impose a surtax on natural gas processors that, if enacted into law, could adversely affect the prices we receive for our natural gas processed in New Mexico. 
In addition, from time to time there has been a significant amount of discussion by legislators and presidential administrations concerning a variety of energy tax proposals at the federal level. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for certain oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production or manufacturing activities and (iv) the increase in the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for, or development of, oil or natural gas within the United States. Any such changes in federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions within the industry that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such changes could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Build Back Better Act (H.R. 5376) was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on November 19, 2021 and contains certain U.S. federal income tax changes and certain additional taxes and fees. 
Changes to state or federal tax laws could adversely affect our business and our financial results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—We are subject to federal, state and local taxes and may become subject to new taxes or have eliminated or reduced certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities as a result of future legislation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”
Hydraulic Fracturing Policies and Procedures
We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the recovery of oil and natural gas in almost every well that we drill and complete. Our engineers responsible for these operations attend specialized hydraulic fracturing training programs taught by industry professionals. Although average drilling and completion costs for each area will vary, as will the cost of each well within a given area, on average approximately half of the total well costs for our horizontal wells are attributable to overall completion activities, which are primarily focused on hydraulic fracture treatment operations. These costs are treated in the same way as all other costs of drilling and completion of our wells and are included in and funded through our normal capital expenditure budget. A change to any federal and state laws and regulations governing hydraulic fracturing could impact these costs and adversely affect our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.”
The protection of groundwater quality is important to us. We believe that we follow all state and federal regulations and apply industry standard practices for groundwater protection in our operations. These measures are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM, with respect to federal acreage). 
Although rare, if the cement and steel casing used in well construction requires remediation, we deal with these problems by evaluating the issue and running diagnostic tools, including cement bond logs and temperature logs, and conducting pressure testing, followed by pumping remedial cement jobs and taking other appropriate remedial measures.
The vast majority of our hydraulic fracturing treatments are made up of water and sand or other kinds of man-made proppants. We use major hydraulic fracturing service companies that track and report chemical additives that are used in fracturing operations as required by the appropriate governmental agencies. These service companies fracture stimulate thousands of wells each year for the industry and employ rigorous safety procedures to protect the environment and work to develop more environmentally friendly fracturing fluids. We follow safety procedures and monitor all aspects of our fracturing operations in an attempt to ensure environmental protection. We do not pump any diesel in the fluid systems of any of our fracture stimulation procedures.
While current fracture stimulation procedures utilize a significant amount of water, we typically recover less than 10% of this fracture stimulation water before produced water becomes a significant portion of the fluids produced. All produced water, including fracture stimulation water, is either recycled or disposed of in permitted and regulated disposal facilities in a way that is designed to avoid any impact to surface waters. Since mid-2015, we have been recycling a portion of our produced water in certain of our Delaware Basin asset areas. Recycling produced water mitigates the need for produced water disposal and also provides cost savings to us. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of the water used in our hydraulic fracturing operations is sourced from recycled produced water from our wells or other sources, further reducing the amount of fresh water in our hydraulic fracturing operations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
The exploration, development, production, gathering and processing of oil and natural gas, including the operation of produced water injection and disposal wells, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations can increase the costs of planning, designing, drilling, completing and operating oil and natural gas wells, midstream facilities and produced water injection and disposal wells. Our activities are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to: the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “OPA 90”), the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”), the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), as well as comparable state statutes and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing the handling, transportation, storage and disposal of wastes generated by our activities and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) that may result from our oil and natural gas operations. Administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for noncompliance with these environmental laws and regulations, and violations and liability with respect to these laws and regulations could also result in remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications or revocations, operational interruptions or shutdowns and other liabilities. Additionally, these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other governmental authorizations before undertaking some activities, may require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations, limit or prohibit other activities because of protected wetlands, areas or species and require investigation and cleanup of pollution. These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the production rate of oil and natural gas or limit the injection of produced water into disposal wells below the rates that would otherwise be possible. We expect to remain in compliance in all material respects with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not expect that these laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on us.
The OPA 90 and its regulations impose requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of crude oil spills and liability for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” under the OPA 90 may include the owner or operator of an onshore 
facility. The OPA 90 subjects responsible parties to strict, joint and several financial liability for removal and remediation costs and other damages, including natural resource damages, caused by an oil spill that is covered by the statute. Failure to comply with the OPA 90 may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement action. 
The CWA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters, fill materials and other materials into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future. Permits are required to discharge pollutants into certain state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in those waters and wetlands. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination resulting from such discharges. In September 2015, a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all CWA programs, thereby defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction, became effective. The EPA rescinded this rule in 2019, however, and promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”) in 2020. The NWPR defined what waters qualify as navigable waters of the United States and are under CWA jurisdiction. This new rule has generally been viewed as narrowing the scope of WOTUS as compared to the 2015 rule, but there is currently litigation in multiple federal district courts challenging the rescission of the 2015 rule and the promulgation of the NWPR. 
Separately, in April 2020, a Montana federal judge vacated the Corps’ Nationwide Permit (“NWP”) 12 and enjoined the Corps from authorizing any dredge or fill activities under NWP 12 until the agency completed formal consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”) under the Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) regarding NWP 12 generally. The court later revised its order to vacate NWP 12 only as it relates to the construction of new oil and natural gas pipelines, and that order was partially vacated in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as moot, based on the Corps’ re-issuance of NWPs in 2021. The Corps has now issued a new set of NWPs, which would replace the NWPs for dredge or fill discharges into WOTUS that the Corps last issued and made available in 2017, but has not elected not to consult with the USFWS. The re-issued NWPs have similarly been subject to the same legal challenges based on the lack of a formal ESA consultation. 
CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on various classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances and for damages to natural resources. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. Although CERCLA generally exempts petroleum from the definition of hazardous substances, our operations may, and in all likelihood will, involve the use or handling of materials that are classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA.
RCRA and comparable state and local statutes govern the management, including treatment, storage and disposal, of both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes. We generate hazardous and nonhazardous solid waste in connection with our routine operations. RCRA includes a statutory exemption that allows many wastes associated with crude oil and natural gas exploration and production to be classified as nonhazardous waste. A similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to RCRA. Not all of the wastes we generate fall within these exemptions. At various times in the past, proposals have been made to amend RCRA to eliminate the exemption applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes. Repeal or modifications of this exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or through changes in applicable state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses. Hazardous wastes are subject to more stringent and costly disposal requirements than nonhazardous wastes.
The CAA, as amended, restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and natural gas production. In addition, certain states have comparable legislation, which may be more restrictive than the CAA. These laws and any implementing regulations impose stringent air permit requirements and require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions, or to use specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—New regulations on all emissions from our operations could cause us to incur significant costs.” Internationally, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the United States in April 2016, requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. While the United States exited the Paris 
Agreement in November 2020, effective February 19, 2021, President Biden caused the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. In April 2021, President Biden set a new goal for the United States to achieve a 50 to 52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. Further, in November 2021, the United States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30% by 2030 and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of alternative sources of energy. In January 2019, New Mexico’s governor signed an executive order declaring that New Mexico would support the goals of the Paris Agreement by joining the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The stated objective of the executive order is to achieve a statewide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 45% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. The executive order also requires New Mexico regulatory agencies to create an “enforceable regulatory framework” to ensure methane emission reductions. In 2021, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (the “NMOCD”) implemented rules regarding the reduction of natural gas waste and the control of emissions that, among other items, require upstream and midstream operators to reduce natural gas waste by a fixed amount each year and achieve a 98% natural gas capture rate by the end of 2026. The New Mexico Environment Department (the “NMED”) has also proposed similar rules and regulations.
Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or operating requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition, as well as those of the oil and natural gas industry in general. For instance, recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA. Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could, and in all likelihood would, require us to incur increased operating costs adversely affecting our profits and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, depressing the prices we receive for oil and natural gas. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases or promoting the development of alternative sources of energy could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—New regulations on all emissions from our operations could cause us to incur significant costs.”
We own and operate underground injection wells throughout our areas of operation. Underground injection is the subsurface placement of fluid through a well, such as the reinjection of brine produced and separated from oil and natural gas production. Underground injection allows us to safely and economically dispose of produced water. The SDWA establishes a regulatory framework for underground injection, the primary objective of which is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. In addition, the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RRC”) and the NMOCD require injected fluids to be confined to a permitted injection interval to aid in the protection of potentially productive intervals. The disposal of hazardous waste by underground injection is subject to stricter requirements than the disposal of produced water. Failure to obtain, or abide by the requirements for the issuance of, necessary permits could subject us to civil and/or criminal enforcement actions and penalties. In addition, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes (induced seismicity) as a result of flawed well design or operation. This has resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that fluid injection or oil and natural gas extraction have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of salt water disposal wells or otherwise, to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. In October 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water or other oil and natural gas waste to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. If the permittee or an applicant for a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone, or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, contributing to seismic activity, then the RRC may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that disposal well. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In addition, in 2021, the NMOCD implemented new rules establishing protocols in response to seismic events in New Mexico. Under these protocols, applications for salt water disposal well permits in certain areas of New Mexico with recent seismic activity require enhanced review prior to approval. The protocols also require enhanced reporting and varying levels of curtailment of injection rates for salt water disposal wells, including potentially shutting in such wells, in the area of seismic events based on the magnitude, timing and proximity of the seismic event. The potential adoption of federal, state and local legislation and regulations intended to address induced seismicity in the areas in which we operate could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our 
ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.
Our activities involve the use of hydraulic fracturing. For more information on our hydraulic fracturing operations, see “Hydraulic Fracturing Policies and Procedures.” Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempted from federal regulation as underground injection (unless diesel is a component of the fracturing fluid) under the SDWA. The process of hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political candidates at the federal, state and local levels have proposed restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including its outright prohibition. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce. Some states and localities have placed additional regulatory burdens upon hydraulic fracturing activities and, in some areas, severely restricted or prohibited those activities. In recent years, various bills have been introduced in the New Mexico legislature to place a moratorium on, ban or otherwise restrict hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the injection of fresh water in such operations. In addition, separate and apart from the referenced potential connection between injection wells and seismicity, concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing activities may be correlated to induced seismicity. The scientific community and regulatory agencies at all levels are studying the possible linkage between oil and natural gas activity and induced seismicity, and some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or guidance to mitigate potential causes of induced seismicity. If the exemption for hydraulic fracturing is removed from the SDWA, or if other legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level imposing any restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing, this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional burdens upon hydraulic fracturing, such as reporting or permitting requirements, would result in additional expense and delay in our operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—Approximately 31% of our leasehold and mineral acres in the Delaware Basin is located on federal lands, which are subject to administrative permitting requirements and potential federal legislation, regulation and orders that may limit or restrict oil and natural gas operations on federal lands.”
Oil and natural gas exploration and production operations and other activities have been conducted on some of our properties by previous owners and operators. Operations by previous owners and operators may not have been conducted in compliance with applicable rules and regulations, and materials from these operations may remain on some of the properties, and, in some instances, require remediation. In addition, we occasionally must agree to indemnify sellers and buyers, respectively, of producing properties against some of the liability for environmental claims or violations associated with the properties we purchase or sell, respectively. While we do not believe that costs we incur for compliance with environmental regulations and remediating previously or currently owned or operated properties will be material, we cannot provide any assurances that these costs will not result in material expenditures that adversely affect our profitability.
Additionally, in the course of our routine oil and natural gas operations, surface spills and leaks, including casing leaks, of oil, produced water or other materials may occur, and we may incur costs for waste handling and environmental compliance. It is also possible that our oil and natural gas operations may require us to manage NORM. NORM is present in varying concentrations in sub-surface formations, including hydrocarbon reservoirs, and may become concentrated in scale, film and sludge in equipment that comes in contact with crude oil and natural gas production and processing streams. Some states, including Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana, have enacted regulations governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM. Moreover, we will be able to control directly the operations of only those wells we operate. Despite our lack of control over wells owned partly by us but operated by others, the failure of the operator to comply with the applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributable to us.
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, the “community right-to-know” regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and similar state statutes require us to organize information about hazardous materials used, released or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens. We are also subject to the requirements and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards.
The ESA was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and to bald and golden eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The USFWS must also designate the species’ critical habitat and suitable habitat as part of the effort to ensure survival of the species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in material restrictions on land use and may materially impact oil and natural gas development. Our oil and natural gas operations in certain of our operating areas could also be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activity designed to protect certain wildlife in the Delaware Basin and other areas in which we operate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—We are subject to government regulation and liability, including complex environmental laws, which could require significant expenditures.” Our ability to maximize production from our leases may be adversely impacted by these restrictions. 
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 31% of our Delaware Basin acreage position consisted of federal leasehold administered by the BLM. Permitting for oil and natural gas activities on federal lands can take significantly longer than the permitting process for oil and natural gas activities not located on federal lands. Delays in obtaining necessary permits can disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. These BLM leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed regulations and orders, which are subject to change. These operations are also subject to BLM rules regarding engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, the valuation of production, the payment of royalties, the removal of facilities, the posting of bonds, hydraulic fracturing, the control of air emissions and other areas of environmental protection. These rules could result in increased compliance costs for our operations, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under certain circumstances, the BLM may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued the Biden Administration Federal Lease Orders limiting the issuance of federal drilling permits and other necessary federal approvals. In addition, the BLM has indicated that the Lease Sale Litigation and the Social Cost of Carbon Litigation may delay lease sales and the approval of drilling permits. Although some of the restrictions in the Biden Administration Federal Lease Orders have lapsed at December 31, 2021, the impact of these federal actions related to the oil and natural gas industry remains unclear. Should these or other limitations or prohibitions be imposed or continue to be applied, our oil and natural gas operations on federal lands could be adversely impacted.
Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are also subject to NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an environmental assessment that assesses impacts that are “reasonably foreseeable” and have a “reasonably close causal relationship” to the agency action under review and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that may be made available for public review and comment. This process, including any additional requirements or procedures that may be included in the process, has the potential to delay or even halt development of future oil and natural gas projects with NEPA applicability.
We have not in the past been, and do not anticipate in the near future to be, required to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total capital expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, but since these laws and regulations are periodically amended, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance. We have no assurance that more stringent laws and regulations protecting the environment will not be adopted or that we will not otherwise incur material expenses in connection with environmental laws and regulations in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Laws and Regulations—We are subject to government regulation and liability, including complex environmental laws, which could require significant expenditures.”
The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly permitting, emissions control, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we have no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.
We maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks and losses associated with our industry and operations. We generally do not carry business interruption insurance. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Operations—Insurance against all operational risks is not available to us.”
Office Location
Our corporate headquarters are located at One Lincoln Centre, 5400 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1500, Dallas, Texas 75240.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, we had 286 full-time employees. We believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory. No employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. From time to time, we use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including in the areas of geology and geophysics, land, production and midstream operations, construction, design, well site surveillance and supervision, permitting and environmental assessment, legal and income tax preparation and accounting services. Independent contractors, at our request, drill all of our wells and usually perform field and on-site production operation services for us, including midstream services, facilities construction, pumping, maintenance, dispatching, inspection and testing. If significant opportunities for 
company growth arise and require additional management and professional expertise, we will seek to employ qualified individuals to fill positions where that expertise is necessary to develop those opportunities.
Employee Recruiting, Retention and Professional Development
We promote inclusion throughout our organization. We respect cultural diversity and do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind, including, but not limited to, discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, disability and veteran or marital status.
Our employees are our most important asset. We have invested the time, attention and resources necessary to recruit, retain and develop an extraordinary team. We offer a comprehensive compensation package with base pay, discretionary bonus and equity incentive opportunities, paid time off, 401(k) matching contributions and an affordable and comprehensive health insurance program, among other benefits. We also provide employees the opportunity to have significant responsibility and daily interaction with our executive management and team leaders. 
We encourage continuing education and study, requiring every employee to complete at least 40 hours of professional training annually. In 2020, for example, our employees completed approximately 15,000 hours of continuing education and study. We also have a formal leadership program that fosters the development and growth of many of our staff with regular meetings and opportunities to enhance their leadership skills. 
Proactive Safety Culture
We are proud to have a company culture that emphasizes safety throughout our operations. Between 2017 and 2021, we estimate our employees have worked approximately 2.7 million combined hours without experiencing a single lost time incident. We attribute much of that to the efforts of our Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) group and of the experienced field and office staff involved in our drilling, completion, production and midstream operations to proactively minimize safety risks and address any potential areas of concern. 
We emphasize the importance of recruiting and maintaining a quality HSE group, and we believe it is important that our HSE group has actual hands-on experience in the field to understand the challenges and issues that can arise. Our HSE group’s experience allows us to understand the technical issues faced by our field employees and contractors, as well as maintain an open dialogue with community leaders in the areas we operate about potential safety issues and mitigation efforts.
